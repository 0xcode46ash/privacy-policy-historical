This Website may offer shopping and other online commerce services, which may be offered by Salem or by a firm that operates a store under contract with us. If our Website offers such services, you will use a customer order form to request information, products, and services. The order form will ask you to give us contact information (e.g., name or email address), financial information (e.g., account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (e.g., zip code or age). We will use the financial information that you provide to bill you for products and services. By giving our Website your credit card and related personal information, you are authorizing our store to give that information to the merchant and credit card company in order to confirm and fulfill your order. We will use contact information from the order form to fulfill your orders. We may also use contact data to get in touch with you when necessary.

* Information We Obtain From Other Sources.

Where permitted by applicable law, we may collect information about you from other sources, including through interactive applications (e.g., mobile devices, third-party services and embedded video players), from co-branded partners and websites (e.g., on our Facebook pages) and from commercially available sources (e.g., data on aggregators and public databases).

* Combining Information.

Please note that all of the information we collect about you may be combined, including to help us tailor our communications to you and to develop rich online content and services across the Salem Websites.

* Public Forums.

This Website makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Any information you disclose in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. We cannot safeguard the privacy of any such information you choose to disclose online in this manner and you must do so carefully and at your own risk.

* User-Generated Content.

Some Salem Websites enable users to submit their own content for contests, blogs, videos, message boards and other functions. Publication of user generated content on the Salem Websites is subject to the terms and rules contained in our Terms of Use for our Websites. Please remember that any information you disclose becomes public information and exercise caution when deciding to disclose your contact, financial and other information in a submission. We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety.

* Banner Advertising.

We license ad-server software from another company to place banner advertising on our Websites. All of the data provided and generated by such software will remain in our possession and no data will be transferred to the licensor of the software. This feature of our Websites may, on occasion, set "cookies" on your computer. Any information collected or stored by the ad-service or the cookies is treated in the same manner as other information as described in this statement.

* Confirmed Opt-In.

Salem acquires no personal or registration data about our users except what you explicitly and voluntarily provide (i.e., via opt-in). We reserve the right to use this information specifically for the purposes related to your registration in addition to any other purpose set forth in this Privacy Policy.

* Feedback Data.

Feedback data is voluntary information (e.g., success stories) provided directly by you for the purposes of assessing the products or services provided through Salem Websites. There are areas on Salem-owned Websites which allow you to submit feedback. Any feedback you submit in these areas becomes the property of Salem, and we reserve the right to use this information for the purposes of marketing, quality control, or to contact you for further information.

* Usage (Log) Data.

Salem also gathers and analyzes usage or log data including your IP (internet protocol) address assigned by your ISP (internet service provider), the type of operating system you are using on your computer, and the type of web browser you are using to view our Website. Salem management uses usage or log data to help diagnose problems with and optimize performance of the server. This information also allows us to evaluate user traffic patterns into, out from, and within our Website. These uses, however, do not allow us to connect your IP address with your personal identity.

* What About "Cookies"?

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that your web browser stores on your computer's hard drive which may contain personally identifying information. From time to time our Website may place cookies on your computer’s hard drive that enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide you with certain features. Use of cookies also provides information about your web usage, which helps us compile demographic and statistical information about visitors who are utilizing our Website. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that.
