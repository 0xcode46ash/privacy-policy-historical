The user's traffic information is analyzed to help streamline the marketing and hosting operations and improve the quality of the Sexpose user experience.

If required to do so, Sexpose may release data to comply with any legal obligation or to enforce the Terms of Service and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property or safety of Sexpose or its subscribers or other. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations, including the police and governmental authorities for the purposes of protection against fraud or any other kind of illegal activity, whether or not identified in the Terms of Service. It is Sexpose's policy, whenever possible and legally permissible, to promptly notify its members upon an obligation to supply data to any third party.

Should any user deliberately upload any illegal material, Sexpose shall forward all available information to all relevant authorities and do so without notice.

The personal information, such as e-mail address, is not shared with any other third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent, except as part of a specific program or feature for which the user will have the possibility to opt-in or opt-out.

This site contains links to other websites. If the user chooses to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, it will be directed to that third party's website. The presentation of a link to another website, a banner ad or other type of advertisement, is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of an affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their own privacy or information security policies. No control is exercised over third party websites. They may place their own cookies or other files on the members' computer, collect data or solicit personal information from them. The other sites follow different rules regarding the use of the personal information submitted to them. It is encouraged to read the privacy policies and statements of any other website visited.

All members are given, or choose, a password, which enables them to access some parts of the Site. The members are responsible for keeping this password confidential and not share it with anyone.

As the transmission of information via internet is not completely secure, Sexpose uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of the members' information. However, Sexpose cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to the site, as the users do so at their own risk.

Phishing and identity theft are of great concern to all involved in Sexpose. Safeguarding information to protect the members from theft identity is a top priority. The user will never, at any time, be requested the credit card information, login information, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website.

All Members may review, update, correct or delete the personal information in their account by contacting Sexpose or by editing their profile via the site. If a member completely deletes all information, then the account may become deactivated. Commercially reasonable efforts will be used to honor the members' requests. An archived copy of the member's records may be retained, as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
