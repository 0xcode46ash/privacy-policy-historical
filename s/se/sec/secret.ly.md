# Secret - Your Privacy

_Last Revised: February 13, 2015_

Welcome to Secret -- the app that allows you to secretly share with others from Secret, Inc. (“Secret,” “we,” “us” or “our”).

This privacy policy explains how we collect, use and disclose information about you when you use our mobile application (the “App”), our Web site (the “Site”) and other online products and services that link to this privacy policy (collectively, the “Service”). By using the Service, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this privacy policy.

Through the Service, you can secretly share messages, pictures, comments and other content (“Posts”) with certain other users of the Service. You may also send private messages directly to other users (“Messages”). When you share a Post through the App, you are secretly sharing your Post with the contacts that you have stored on your mobile device and/or your Facebook friends (if you register through Facebook) who also register with our Service (your “Friends”). In addition, each time a user “loves” a Post, that Post is shared with the contacts of that user (“Friends of Friends”) and so on. People who can see your Posts because they have been loved by Friends, Friends of Friends and so on are considered in your “Network.” We may also choose to feature certain Posts, in which case such Posts may be secretly shared with all users of the Service.

For more information about the Service, please see our [FAQ page](https://web.archive.org/faq).

## Modifications

We may change this privacy policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the privacy policy periodically to stay informed about our practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

## Collection of Information

### Information You Provide to Us

We collect information you directly give us. For example, we collect information about you when you sign up for our Service, make a Post, send a Message, give feedback about the Service or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your email address, your mobile phone number and any other information you choose to provide. When you request that the App find your Friends, we also collect certain information from your contacts on your mobile device (or from Facebook, according to the permissions you grant us when using Facebook to sign up for our Service), including your contacts’ email addresses and phone numbers, so you can secretly share your Posts with people you know who are already using the App. However, we hash your contacts email address and phone number before they leave your mobile device so we do not have access to that information. For information as to how to restrict the collection of contact information, please see the “Your Choices” section below. We may also collect information about you from other users of the Service (for example, we may collect your contact details from another user if such details are stored on the user's mobile device). If you choose not to provide certain information, we may not be able to provide the Service to you or certain features of the Service may be unavailable or work differently.

### Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Service

When you access or use our Service, we automatically collect certain information about you. This information includes:

  * **Log Information:** We log information about your use of the Service, including the type of device you use, access times, location information, Posts and pages viewed, Posts “loved,” and the page you visited before navigating to our Service. We use this information for analytic and product improvement purposes.
  * **Device Information:** We collect information about the mobile device you use to access our Service, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers and mobile network information. We use this information for analytic and product improvement purposes. 
  * **Location Information:** We may collect information about the general location of your Internet Service Provider based on your IP Address. If you allow Secret to access your location information, we may also collect your geolocation information. We use this information to show you Posts from users in your Network who are located near you and to show your Posts to users in your Network who are nearby. For information as to how to restrict the collection of geolocation information, please see the “Your Choices” section below.
  * **Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:** We use various technologies to collect information, and this may include cookies and web beacons. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory. Web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”) are non-visible electronic images. These technologies are used for analytic and product improvement purposes, such as seeing which areas and features of our Service are popular and determining whether an email has been opened and acted upon. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see “Your Choices” below.



## Use of Information

We may use information about you for various purposes, including to:

  * Provide, deliver, maintain, test and improve our Service;
  * Send you technical notices, updates, confirmations, security alerts and support and administrative messages;
  * Respond to your comments, questions and requests and provide customer service;
  * Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards and events offered by Secret and others, and provide news and information we think will be of interest to you;
  * Monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with our Service and improve and personalize the Service;
  * Detect, investigate and prevent any suspected breaches of our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tos); and
  * Link or combine with information we get from others to help understand your needs and provide you with better service; and
  * Connect you with other users in your contacts.



## Storage of Information

The information you provide to Secret is encrypted and stored on servers operated by Google. We take reasonable measures to protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, but we cannot guarantee that our system is infallible. For more information on how we store and seek to protect the information on our Services please see the blog post entitled “[Demystifying Secret](https://medium.com/@davidbyttow/demystifying-secret-12ab82fda29f).”

We also seek to minimize the data we keep. Your information is stored only as long as necessary to accomplish the purposes described in this privacy policy. You may delete your account at any time by emailing concierge@secret.ly. Your information will typically be deleted from our system within thirty day. However, Google and other service providers that we may use to store information may have their own data backup and retention policies. Though we will not have access to your information after it is deleted from our system, it may take longer for your information to be completely removed from our service providers and content delivery networks.

## Sharing of Information

We may share aggregated, de-identified or non-personal information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this privacy policy:

  * With other users of the Service (including some whom may not be your contacts) by providing them with your secret Posts and Messages and your general location (if you have enabled us to collect your location).



We may also share information (which may at times include personal information) about you as follows:

  * With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;
  * In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of Secret assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company;
  * In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;
  * If the content of a Post can reasonably be considered illegal or unlawful (or we have a good faith belief that the Post is being used to engage in, encourage or promote such activities), in which case we may share your identity and other information with proper authorities;
  * If we believe that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights, property and safety of Secret, our users and/or others; and
  * With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through our Service that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information.



Note that if you choose to include information about you in your Posts or Messages, such information will be shared with other users of the Service who receive such Posts or Messages as described in this privacy policy. We suggest that you do not include any identifiable information about you in your Posts or Messages. Also, please note that if you or other users choose to share a Post through a third party, such as Facebook, Twitter or an email client, any further collection and sharing of that Post by such third party or its users will be governed by that third party’s privacy policy, and we cannot control what any third party does with any Posts or other information that is shared with third parties.

### How We Respond to Subpoenas from Courts

If a court asks us to disclose your identity, we may be compelled to do so to the extent possible. If we receive a subpoena or court order requesting that we disclose your information, we will attempt to contact you, if feasible, before we disclose any information to give you time to fight the subpoena in court. In the United States, for example, you may be able to fight the subpoena on the basis that it violates your First Amendment right to speak anonymously.

This may include disclosures to overseas recipients outside of the European Economic Area, including countries that do not have laws that protect personal information in the same manner as countries within the European Economic Area.
