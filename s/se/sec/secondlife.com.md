# Second Life: Terms of Service

|  At Linden Lab, we are committed to protecting your privacy and creating a strong bond with you, our customers. This privacy policy explains the use of information collected via our website, customer service operations and Second Life service. As used in this privacy policy, the term "personal information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information, whether at work or at home. Please read this information carefully - we urge all consumers to take an active role in helping us protect their privacy by becoming aware of the policies they encounter. There are five principles guiding this privacy policy: 

  1. We collect personal information and usage statistics to maintain a high-quality customer experience and deliver superior customer service.
  2. Some information we request directly from you during registration. Other pieces of data are gathered indirectly from website traffic or Second Life gameplay.
  3. Except under certain limited circumstances, Linden Lab does not disclose personal information you provide to any third parties without your permission. Linden Lab may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Linden Lab, this web site or any user of Second Life; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Linden Lab, Second Life or the users of Second Life; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of this web site, Second Life or the public. In addition, if Linden Lab should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, we may sell the information you provide to us on this site to a third party or share your personal information with any company with whom we merge.
  4. You will have the ability to update the personal data you provided to us during registration by contacting us privacy@lindenlab.com.

**The Information We Collect and How We Collect It**

There are different levels of information we collect, depending upon your relationship to Linden Lab. 

**Anonymous Website Visitor:** If you visit our websites we automatically record information related to your IP address, Linden Lab cookie information, and aggregate information on what content you access or visit. This information is collected in the background while you move around our website. 

**Mailing List Member:** If you choose to provide us personal information in order to subscribe to our mailing list, we collect information to aid delivery and preferences such as e-mail address and message performance statistics. 

**Registered Website Member:** If you choose to register on our website, we will track broad site usage information as well as aggregate usage of website community features such as downloads and forums. This is in addition to the personal data collected during the registration process. 

**Second Life Subscriber:** If you become a subscriber to the Second Life service, we collect and aggregate a variety of data to monitor system and simulation performance. This includes information about your computer hardware and Internet connection, which are stored together but are not personally identifiable. We track usage of customer-service resources in order to ensure high quality interactions. This is in addition to the personal data and billing information collected during the registration process. 

Additionally there are a few special situations to note: 

**Service Beta User:** If you volunteer to serve as a beta user for pre-commercial content, we will track bug reports and potentially individual system performance in an effort to rigorously test pre-deployed technology. 

**Former Customer:** If you cease being a customer of ours, we will keep a copy of your registration file in our database for use in the event you wish to rejoin the Second Life service. 

**Response to Job Postings or Unsolicited Communications:** Please note that information we receive in reference to a job posting or via unsolicited communications does not fall under the privacy terms outlined in this policy. However, information from your resume will be used solely for the purposes of evaluating your candidacy for employment. 

**Individuals Outside of the United States:** Anyone using the Linden Lab or Second Life websites from outside of the United States should be aware that personal Information collected on these websites may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Linden Lab or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using these websites, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
