# Privacy Policy | Section Hiker

This privacy policy describes [FellsPress LLC](http://www.fellspress.com/)  privacy practices for the [SectionHiker.com web site](http://sectionhiker.com/), including what types of information we gather and track, how we use the information and with whom we share the information. By using the SectionHiker.com Web site, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting revisions to the SectionHiker.com web site, and your continued use of the SectionHiker.com web site indicates your agreement to the revised terms. Accordingly, we urge you to frequently review this Privacy Policy, and, if you do not agree to the terms of this or any revised policy, please exit the SectionHiker.com web site immediately.

### Privacy of Children

Children (persons under the age of 14) are not eligible to use the SectionHiker.com web site without the supervision of their parents. If you are under the age of 14 please do not submit any personal information to us. If you are under the age of 14 please only use the SectionHiker.com web site under the supervision of your parents or guardian. If you are under 13, please do not provide us with any information about yourself. If we discover that we have collected any Personally Identifiable Information regarding a child 12 or under, we will delete the information as soon as possible.

### What Information is Collected?

The SectionHiker.com web site may collect two types of information about you: Personally Identifiable Information and Aggregate Information that is anonymous (such as your IP address – a number used to identify your computer when you are on the Internet – or the type of browser you are using).

Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are and can be used to identify, contact or locate you (such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address). You can visit the SectionHiker.com web site without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. You may be required to register or otherwise voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information to have access to some features of the SectionHiker.com web site. You always may choose not to provide the Personally Identifiable Information, but this may lead to decreased functionality of the SectionHiker.com web site for you and our inability to provide you with certain products or services. We also may request you to voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information that is not required to access features of our site. This information enables us to make general improvements to the SectionHiker.com web site and better serve your specific interests.

The SectionHiker.com web site may transparently collect Aggregate Information through the use of cookies or by other means. We use this information to assess general usage patterns, administer and make improvements to SectionHiker.com web site and collect demographic information useful in some way to SectionHiker.com and our business partners. We hope that by using Aggregate Information, we can update the SectionHiker.com web site to make it more useful to you and other users. We, and our business partners, reserve the right to use, maintain, update, disclose and/or sell Aggregate Information.

### What We Will and Will Not Do With the Information You Provide

SectionHiker.com uses information generally to compile statistical data, keep in contact with users and provide them with a better interactive experience. We may use your information specifically for the following purposes:

  * to keep you informed about posts or articles in which you may have interest;
  * to contact you as part of a promotion, such as a raffle;
  * to allow you to make a posting on the SectionHiker.com web site;
  * to respond to your queries submitted by email or using a contact form on the SectionHiker.com web site;
  * to meet legal requirements;
  * to provide Internet security; and/or to analyze the collected information.



In the event of a merger, consolidation, or sale or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets or business, one of the assets transferred may include the information we collect about our users.

The SectionHiker.com web site works closely with our business partners and certain other third parties who may perform functions on our behalf, such as RSS feed services, email services, advertising networks, affiliate networks, content syndication, search, web hosting services, and web metrics services. They may have access to your Personally Identifiable Information only to the extent necessary to perform their functions and may not use it for any other purpose.

We may from time to time cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other efforts to enforce laws. We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information in response to legal process, such as a court order or subpoena, or to protect the SectionHiker.com web site, hosted sites or users of these sites. We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information in response to a request by law enforcement if there is an investigation of criminal conduct or other illegal activity. In most cases you may not receive notice of this disclosure to law enforcement. Therefore, we cannot promise, nor should you expect that, communications you make will always remain private.

Other than for the specific purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to any third parties unless we obtain your prior consent or are legally compelled to do so. In addition, we will not contact you without your permission except as specified above or in connection with the registration process.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

When you visit the SectionHiker.com web site, we or a third-party advertiser may store or recognize some information on your computer in the form of a “cookie” to better match your interests and preferences.
