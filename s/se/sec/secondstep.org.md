COMMITTEE FOR CHILDREN  
PRIVACY POLICY

This privacy policy (“Policy”) explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Committee for Children (“CfC”, “we”, or “us”) with respect to your use of the Web site located at www.cfchildren.org (the “Site”) so you can make an informed decision about using the Site. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.

  
WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?  
As used herein, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual or information about that individual when directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of products, services, or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.

  
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?   
We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. Personal information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with: posting content, sending an email or message to another user, or participating in any interactive forums or features on the Site.   
When you use the Site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring Web site, and your activity on the Site. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.

  
We may automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies” or Web beacons. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user's hard drive at the request of a Web site to enable the site to recognize users who have visited them previously and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history. If we link cookies to any personally identifying information, we will treat this information as personal information. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Site. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site may not function properly.

  
HOW DO WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT?   
In general, we use personal information we collect to process your requests or transactions; to provide you with information, products, or services you request; to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products, or services we think will be of interest to you; to facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, the Site; and for the purpose for which the information was provided.

  
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES?  
We will not share the personal information we collect from you through this Site with third parties except as described in this Policy, as it may be revised from time to time. We may share personal information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers (“Service Providers”) who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Site or the services we provide and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. We may also share personal information with other third parties when you give us your consent to do so. We are not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these Service Providers or other third parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them. Nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregate information, which may be shared with third parties without your consent.

  
We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or authorities; to respond to any claims; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of CfC, our users, our members, our employees, or the public, including without limitation to protect CfC or our users or members from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our Site. Information about our users and members, including personal information, may also be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger or sale of organizational assets, or in any other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of the assets of CfC.

  
You understand that when you use the Site, information you post in your profile, blogs, listings, public or private groups, forums, and other interactive areas of the Site, as well as any information you share with individuals through the Site, will be available to other users and in some cases may be publicly available. We recommend you be cautious about giving out personal information to others or sharing personal information in public or private online forums. We are not responsible for the actions of any third parties with whom you share personal information.

  
WHAT STEPS DO WE TAKE TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION ONLINE?

WHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR INFORMATION?   
You may “opt out” of receiving marketing or promotional emails from us, by following the directions in such emails. This will not affect our ability to send you service- and account-related emails or to use your personal information as otherwise described in this Policy.
