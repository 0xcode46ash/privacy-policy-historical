SecondSpin.com does not use cookies to track user activities beyond their use of SecondSpin.com's service.

**A Special Note About Children Under 13** **  
** SecondSpin.com recognizes the importance of keeping children safe in cyberspace. We encourage parents and guardians to be aware of the nature of the sites their children visit, and to participate in their children's online experiences.

In accordance with the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), children under the age of 13 are not allowed to register as members of SecondSpin.com.

_As a Parent, What Does this Mean to You?_  
As a practical matter, you do not need to be a member of SecondSpin.com to enjoy our great content. Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no web site operator can require, as a condition of participation in an activity, that a child under the age of 13 disclose more information than is reasonably necessary. SecondSpin.com abides by this requirement. We do not request, nor do we collect, any personally identifying information from non-members in order to use these features of our site. While children of all ages are welcome to visit our site to enjoy these features, parents and guardians should note that while SecondSpin.com is primarily a general interest web site with content suitable for everyone, some material on our site (features dealing with "R" rated movies and explicit lyrics in music, for example) may be inappropriate for children.

However, we do use personal member information for site personalization features and for the administration of our sweepstakes, games and contests. Accordingly, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting verifiable parental consent. Since we require users to provide some personal information to register for SecondSpin.com membership before they may use these site personalization features and services, children under 13 will not be able to use these features of our site WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OF, AND USE OF CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION BY, WEBSITES THAT WE DON'T OPERATE, and this policy does not apply to linked sites
