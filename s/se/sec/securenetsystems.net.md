Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. Cookies allow us to provide features such as the Control Panel, from where you can manage your account online. 

The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our website's best features, so we recommend that you leave them turned on.
