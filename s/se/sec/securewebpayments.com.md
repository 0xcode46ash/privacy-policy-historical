We use Anonymous Information mainly to evaluate and improve the Service, and to provide Affiliates with insights into their End-Users’ behaviors and preferences all on an anonymous basis.

Log Data.  When you visit the SWP Site or an Affiliate Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ( **“Log Data”** ) **.   **This Log Data may include information such as pages that you visit, the time spent on those pages, access times and dates, and other statistics.  We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Service and for the Service’s technical administration, to increase our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Service to our visitors’ needs.  We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests.  We do not use Log Data in association with other Personal Information **,** though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Anonymous Information.

**Cookies**

Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information on the SWP Site as well as on Affiliate Sites. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies for two purposes.  First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins.  Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the SWP Site or the Affiliate Sites, to better understand how you interact with such sites and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on such sites.  Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the applicable site and then close your browser.  You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the SWP Site or the Affiliate Sites.  We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal information you submit while on our site or our affiliate’s sites.

The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.

Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

**Phishing**
