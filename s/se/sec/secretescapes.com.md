# Secret Escapes Privacy Policy

Secret Escapes Ltd is a UK registered company that wholly owns and operates the website secretescapes.com. This privacy policy refers to your use of the Secret Escapes website and the information we may collect from you as you do so. 

### Information we may collect from you

For access to our hand-picked hotels at members-only rates, all we require is your email address so that you can sign in to our site securely (using your own unique password) and receive our latest and greatest offers directly in your inbox.

By signing up to Secret Escapes, we ensure that all members are able to manage their account and email preferences when they sign in to secretescapes.com, so that they may receive as many, or as few, emails as they like. Our Anti-Spam Policy tolerates only permission-based email (we require your say so before sending you any marketing emails), and members may opt-out or change email preferences by following a link in the footer of all marketing emails, or by visiting their account settings at secretescapes.com.

Members of Secret Escapes reserve the right to manage their email preferences and may choose to opt out of marketing communications, yet maintain full access to secretescapes.com.

Some communications (for example, important account notifications and billing information) are considered transactional and are necessary for all of our customers. You must cancel your Secret Escapes account to unsubscribe from these communications. To cancel your Secret Escapes account, please email us at [support@secretescapes.com](mailto:support@secretescapes.com)

In addition to personal information that you choose to give us we may also collect information about your computer, this may include your IP address, operating system, web browser software, screen resolution and referring web site.

**We do not store financial details such as credit card numbers.**

### How we use this information

Any personal information such as email address or postcode is held by us for the sole purpose of communicating with you as you have requested. That means sending you newsletters if you have subscribed or replying to you if you give us feedback or apply for a job with us.

We will not share this information with any other parties unless specifically stated in any special terms and conditions as is sometimes the case with competition entries.

### Cookies

We use cookies primarily to make our website easier for you to use as well as for marketing and analytics purposes. Our cookies don't store sensitive information such as your name, address or financial details. You can delete any cookies stored on your computer but this may prevent you from accessing the site.
