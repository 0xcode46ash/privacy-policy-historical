### **SecureWorks EU Safe Harbor Policy**

This Section of the Privacy Policy describes how SecureWorks handles personal data of representatives of, and event data related to, certain clients from the European Union in connection with the delivery of the following managed security services: [Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)](https://web.archive.org/services/network_intrusion_prevention_detection.html), Log Monitoring, Log Retention, Host IPS, Firewall Monitoring, Firewall Management, Vulnerability Scanning and Security Incident Management (SIM) On-Demand ("Covered Services") Specifically, SecureWorks adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles ("EU Safe Harbor") with respect to certain personally identifiable information that it receives from Covered Services clients in the European Union related to its services ("EU Personal Data"). SecureWorks has various other service offerings and data collections (for example, consulting services) which are not covered by this Section of the Privacy Policy, nor by SecureWorks' participation in the EU Safe Harbor and SecureWorks makes no EU Safe Harbor representations with respect to any data collected or used in these service offerings or data collections. For further background about the EU Safe Harbor, please refer to the U.S. Department of Commerce's website at <http://export.gov/safeharbor/>.

### **Collection and Use of EU Personal Data**

From its clients, SecureWorks may collect name, title, address, phone, fax, pager number, and other contact information ("Contact Data") for purposes of contacting clients as necessary or appropriate to provide or support the Covered Services. Where permitted by law, SecureWorks may also use this Contact Data to communicate regarding SecureWorks products or services, and disclose such data to subsidiaries, business partners and independent resellers of SecureWorks services for the same purposes. With respect to any sharing of EU Personal Data for purposes of marketing SecureWorks products and services, SecureWorks obtains promises from its subsidiaries, business partners and independent resellers that such entities will use and disclose the EU Personal Data for purposes of marketing SecureWorks products and services only. Individuals may opt-out of further disclosures of their EU Personal Data from SecureWorks to subsidiaries, business partners and independent resellers, and further uses of their data by SecureWorks for marketing, by contacting SecureWorks at 404-327-6339. If you receive a marketing communication from one our subsidiaries, business partners or independent resellers, you should opt-out with that entity directly.

In connection with providing the Covered Services, SecureWorks may collect passwords, user names, and other data from client networks, which may incidentally include EU Personal Data ("Event Data") for the exclusive purposes of performing the Covered Services on behalf of its clients. SecureWorks does not control the content of the Event Data as this data is securely transmitted to SecureWorks by its clients' network assets. This Event Data is merely stored and processed by SecureWorks and clients are informed that the Event Data may be transmitted outside the EU. Clients are responsible for warranting that the client had the full authority to transmit such Event Data to SecureWorks for purposes of the Covered Services. At all times with respect to Event Data, and not for any other purpose under US federal or state law, SecureWorks acts as a mere "data processor" (as that term is defined under applicable EU law or otherwise referred to under the EU Safe Harbor as an "agent") on behalf of its clients.

### **Data Integrity and Access**

SecureWorks takes commercially reasonable precautions to protect EU Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

To the extent necessary or appropriate consistent with its role as a data processor, SecureWorks makes reasonable efforts to keep Event Data reliable for its intended use, accurate, current, and complete. SecureWorks makes reasonable efforts to keep all other EU Personal Data reliable for its intended use, accurate, current, and complete. SecureWorks also provides client contacts with the opportunity to access, review and correct their own Contact Data, and otherwise provides clients access in accordance with the EU Safe Harbor. SecureWorks will respond to the request within 30 days.

As a data processor, SecureWorks has no direct relationship with the individuals whose EU Personal Data may be included in Event Data processed by SecureWorks. Individuals, who may be clients' customers or employees, seeking to correct, amend or delete EU Personal Data included in Event Data should first contact their company's representative (i.e., SecureWorks' client), the data controller, who provided the data to SecureWorks. The client will then provide access to the individual as determined under the applicable local data protection law and SecureWorks will cooperate with the client per the established contractual arrangements.

### **Other Disclosures**

SecureWorks may also disclose EU Personal Data as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of its business, provided that it will notify affected clients in accordance with the procedure for changing this Privacy Statement as noted above. In situations where SecureWorks discloses EU Personal Data to any third parties acting as "agents" on behalf of SecureWorks, SecureWorks will require the recipient to protect the data in accordance with the relevant principles in the EU Safe Harbor, or otherwise take steps to ensure that the EU Personal Data is appropriately protected. SecureWorks may also disclose EU Personal Data where required or permitted by law, where SecureWorks believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request or otherwise permitted by the EU Safe Harbor, or in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or enforce or apply SecureWorks agreements.
