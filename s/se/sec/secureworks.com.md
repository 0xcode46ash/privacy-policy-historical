###  **Dell SecureWorks EU and Swiss Safe Harbors Policy**

This Section of the Privacy Policy describes how Dell SecureWorks handles personal data of representatives of, and event data related to, certain customers from the European Union and Switzerland in connection with the delivery of the following managed security services: [Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)](http://www.secureworks.com/it_security_services/network_intrusion_prevention_detection/ "IPS / IDS"), Log Monitoring, Log Retention, Host IPS, Firewall Monitoring, Firewall Management, Vulnerability Scanning and Security Incident Management (SIM) On-Demand and other managed security and consulting  services ("Covered Services") Specifically, Dell SecureWorks adheres to the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles ("EU Safe Harbor") and to the Swiss EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles (“Swiss Safe Harbor” and together with the EU Safe Harbor, the “European Safe Harbors”) with respect to certain personally identifiable information that it receives from Covered Services customers in the European Union and Switzerland related to its services ("European Personal Data"). Dell SecureWorks has various other service offerings and data collections (for example, consulting services) which are not covered by this Section of the Privacy Policy, nor by Dell SecureWorks' participation in the European Safe Harbors and Dell SecureWorks makes no European Safe Harbors representations with respect to any data collected or used in these service offerings or data collections. For further background about the European Safe Harbors, please refer to the U.S. Department of Commerce's website at <http://export.gov/safeharbor/>. 

###  **Collection and Use of European Personal Data**

From its customers, Dell SecureWorks may collect name, title, address, phone, fax, pager number, and other contact information ("Contact Data") for purposes of contacting customers as necessary or appropriate to provide or support the Covered Services. Where permitted by law, Dell SecureWorks may also use this Contact Data to communicate regarding Dell SecureWorks products or services, and disclose such data to subsidiaries, business partners and independent resellers of Dell SecureWorks services for the same purposes. With respect to any sharing of European Personal Data for purposes of marketing Dell SecureWorks products and services, Dell SecureWorks obtains promises from its subsidiaries, business partners and independent resellers that such entities will use and disclose the European Personal Data for purposes of marketing Dell SecureWorks products and services only. Individuals may opt-out of further disclosures of their European Personal Data from Dell SecureWorks to subsidiaries, business partners and independent resellers, and further uses of their data by SecureWorks for marketing, by contacting Dell SecureWorks at 404-327-6339. If you receive a marketing communication from one our subsidiaries, business partners or independent resellers, you should opt-out with that entity directly. 

In connection with providing the Covered Services, Dell SecureWorks may collect passwords, user names, and other data from customer networks, which may incidentally include European Personal Data ("Event Data") for the exclusive purposes of performing the Covered Services on behalf of its customers. Dell SecureWorks does not control the content of the Event Data as this data is securely transmitted to Dell SecureWorks by its customers' network assets. This Event Data is merely stored and processed by Dell SecureWorks and customers are informed that the Event Data may be transmitted outside the EU or Switzerland. Customers are responsible for warranting that the customer had the full authority to transmit such Event Data to Dell SecureWorks for purposes of the Covered Services. At all times with respect to Event Data, and not for any other purpose under US federal or state law, Dell SecureWorks acts as a mere "data processor" (as that term is defined under applicable EU or Swiss law or otherwise referred to under the European Safe Harbors as an "agent") on behalf of its customers. 

###  **Data Integrity and Access**

Dell SecureWorks takes commercially reasonable precautions to protect European Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. 

To the extent necessary or appropriate consistent with its role as a data processor, Dell SecureWorks makes reasonable efforts to keep Event Data reliable for its intended use, accurate, current, and complete. Dell SecureWorks makes reasonable efforts to keep all other European Personal Data reliable for its intended use, accurate, current, and complete. Dell SecureWorks also provides customer contacts with the opportunity to access, review and correct their own Contact Data, and otherwise provides customers access in accordance with the European Safe Harbors. Dell SecureWorks will respond to the request within 30 days. 

As a data processor, Dell SecureWorks has no direct relationship with the individuals whose European Personal Data may be included in Event Data processed by Dell SecureWorks. Individuals, who may be clients' customers or employees, seeking to correct, amend or delete European Personal Data included in Event Data should first contact their company's representative (i.e., Dell SecureWorks' customer), the data controller, who provided the data to Dell SecureWorks. The customer will then provide access to the individual as determined under the applicable local data protection law and Dell SecureWorks will cooperate with the customer per the established contractual arrangements. 

###  **Other Disclosures**

Dell SecureWorks may also disclose European Personal Data as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of its business, provided that it will notify affected customers in accordance with the procedure for changing this Privacy Statement as noted above. In situations where Dell SecureWorks discloses European Personal Data to any third parties acting as "agents" on behalf of Dell SecureWorks, Dell SecureWorks will require the recipient to protect the data in accordance with the relevant principles in the European Safe Harbors, or otherwise take steps to ensure that the European Personal Data is appropriately protected. Dell SecureWorks may also disclose European Personal Data where required or permitted by law, where Dell SecureWorks believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request or otherwise permitted by the European Safe Harbors, or in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or enforce or apply Dell SecureWorks agreements.
