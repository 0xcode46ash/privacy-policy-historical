**Philosophy**

Second To None values the relationships we have with our clients, evaluators, and web site visitors. In order to maintain and strengthen these relationships, we have the responsibility to protect the confidentiality of information they choose to share with us.

**Information Gathered**

For each visitor to our web site, our web server automatically logs the visitor's domain. We collect this information, along with aggregate information on what pages are accessed, and information volunteered by the visitor, such as contact, survey, or application information.

**Information Usage**

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web pages, to customize the content for each individual visitor, to complete evaluations and surveys requested by our clients, and to contact visitors for recruiting and marketing purposes. All information will be stored as securely as possible while maintaining the ability for authorized employees to access this information when required. 

Certain areas of our web site require the use of a cookie to retain information about a visitor's session with our server. A cookie is a small amount of text placed on a visitor's computer hard drive. Its purpose is to permit our server to maintain information when navigating from page to page within our web site. We want to assure visitors that accepting a cookie does not give us access to information stored on their computer.

**Information Distribution**

Any information we gather is kept confidential. We will never willfully disclose identifiable information about our clients, evaluators, or visitors to any third party or mailing list without first receiving authorization.
