    time.

    ard technical information, such as (i) the IP address of the user’s computer,
    (ii) browser software, (iii) the user’s operating system, and (iv) the referring
    site.
4.3 Cookies are used to track the user’s behaviour at the site and to provide an
    enhanced user experience. Cookies are also used in connection with any ser-
    vice requiring authentication. Certain functionalities may not be available if the
    user disables cookies on his/her browser.
5.  Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to Third Parties
5.1 Secunia will not disclose any personally identifiable information to any third
    party unless the user has given his/her prior consent hereto, in accordance
    with the Danish Act on Processing of Personal Data, which allows disclosure of
    the gathered information following the user’s consent.
                                                                              Page 2 of 4


6.  Use of Personal Data
6.1 Personal information is used primarily to complete the service for which the
    personal information is collected.
6.2 Additionally, the information is used internally by Secunia in order to become
    better acquainted with the user.
6.3 This use may include studies and analyses directed at improving Secunia’s
    products, services, and technologies.
7.  Changes in the Processing of Personal Data
7.1 The rapid development of the Internet means that changes in Secunia’s pro-
    cessing of personal data may be required.
7.2 Therefore, Secunia is entitled to update and amend its Privacy Policy regarding
    processing of personal data. If Secunia does change its Privacy Policy, Secunia
    must state the date when the policy was last updated at the end of the last
    page in the Privacy Policy. In the event of significant changes made to the Pri-
    vacy Policy, Secunia will notify users in a visible notice on Secunia’s websites,
    and the users will be instructed in how to unregister the personal information.
8.  Storing Information
8.1 The data collected by Secunia will not be kept for a longer period than what is
    necessary to fulfil the purpose for which the data was processed.
9.  Protection of Personal Information
9.1 According to the Danish Act on Processing of Personal Data, personal infor-
    mation is to be stored in a secure and confidential manner. Secunia stores the
    personal information provided by users on computers which have limited ac-
    cess and which are located in controlled facilities. Secunia also regularly car-
    ries out checks to ensure that Secunia’s personal user information is handled
    securely and continuously to protect the user’s rights, according to the Danish
    Act on Processing of Personal Data.
                                                                             Page 3 of 4


9.2  However, Secunia cannot guarantee security for data transmission via the In-
     ternet. This means that there is a risk that other persons may gain unauthor-
     ised access to personal information when data is transmitted and stored elec-
     tronically. Therefore, although Secunia strives to protect users’ privacy in the
     best possible way, Secunia cannot guarantee the security of all information.
10.  Marketing
10.1 Any e-mail lists and marketing activities operated by Secunia are opt-in/opt-
     out compliant. If, for any reason, users cannot opt-out or Secunia continues to
     send e-mails and marketing material by mistake after the user has opted out,
     users must contact marketing@secunia.com and ask to be placed on Secunia’s
     “block list”. Secunia will then make sure that the user is manually removed
     from Secunia’s mailing lists.
