# Softnik Technologies: Privacy Policy

## Personal Information

There are times, however, when we may request information from you, such as your, name, address and e-mail address. When additional information is requested, we will try to let you know at the time of collection how we intend to use the personal information you provide, such as respond to your inquiry, participate in certain promotions, conduct a survey or allow you to access specific information. If you sign up for an Softnik electronic newsletter or e-mail list, each message will include instructions on how to "unsubscribe" from that list. We respect your right to choose whether to give us personal information or "opt out" if you do not wish to disclose personal information. We do our best to maintain the accuracy of any personal information you do supply to us.

Any information provided by you will be used for Softnik's purposes only. Your information will not be shared with individual or other companies [such as direct mail organizations or other third parties] unless required by law. However, Softnik may need to provide your name and delivery address to third parties that Softnik uses for delivering specific services to you (such as support services or shipping purposes when you ask us to send something to you).

Our Web sites may provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those Web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third party sites.
