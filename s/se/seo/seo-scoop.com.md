# About SEO Scoop | SEO Scoop

SEO Scoop is my search engine optimization blog, enabling me to share my search engine optimization experience and theories with other interested SEOs. I often post in various search engine related forums under the name of [DazzlinDonna](http://www.dazzlindonna.com/blog/), but my real name is Donna Fontenot.

I own or manage lots of websites and I keep up with the ever-changing world of search engine optimization. I don’t make any claims that my theories are facts. Only those people who are privy to the search engine algorithms can make such a claim. However, from my own experiences, testing, and collaboration with other SEOs, I believe I have a very good basis upon which to state my theories.

I do not own an SEO company, nor do I offer SEO services to the general public, except in rare cases. I run my own websites, as well as those of a few select clients, so I can be unbiased in my thoughts here, as I am not looking to acquire clients from those users who visit SEO Scoop. I have been lucky enough to maintain good SEO rankings for competitive keywords, and am happy to share the wealth of knowledge I’ve accumulated with others.

This site will be a collection of SEO-related material. I’ll share my thoughts on the best tools to use, throw out some ideas and theories, and post updates on current happenings in the search engine world.

Some of the things I post will be geared towards SEO for Newbies. I’m a big fan of helping newbies understand the basics of search engine optimization. Everyone has to start somewhere, right? Some of the articles I will post will be geared more towards the experienced SEO. Essentially, my posts will reflect whatever topic I feel like sharing at that moment, so the posts will cover a wide range of levels.
