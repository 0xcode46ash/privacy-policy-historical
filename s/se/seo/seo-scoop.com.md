# SEO Scoop Privacy Policy

Effective 01/01/2005 

Our Commitment To Privacy 

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 

The Information We Collect: 

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the seo-scoop.com website. Currently, we do not collect any information, but in the future we may. On some pages, we may allow you register to receive materials. The types of personal information we may collect at these pages are: 

Name  
Email address 

The Way We Use Information: 

We use the information you provide about yourself only to send you materials you request (such as a newsletter). We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that request. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

Our Commitment To Data Security 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

Our Commitment To Children's Privacy: 

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13. If we have reason to suspect that a child under the age of 13 has entered personal information, we will remove the information from our database. 

How To Contact Us
