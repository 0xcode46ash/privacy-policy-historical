# Privacy Policy for SEO by the Sea

> “The makers of the Constitution conferred the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by all civilized men—the right to be let alone.”
> 
> -Justice Louis D. Brandeis

In operating SEO by the Sea, it is unavoidable to collect some information about the people who visit the site, who leave comments, and who send contact messages and emails.

Information collected by SEO by the Sea about visits to the site in SEO by the Sea’s generic web logs will not be shared with others, except for the use of non-identifying and aggregated information to better the design of SEO by the Sea or attract advertisers.

Private information shared with the owner of SEO by the Sea through contact form or email or in any other method will remain private unless permission is provided to share the information, or the information is demanded through an order from the Courts or a specific legal authority of the State of Delaware or the US Government.

SEO by the Sea does not target nor purposefully or knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.

SEO by the Sea contains links to other websites which have their own privacy practices, and this privacy policy only applies to the pages of SEO by the Sea, and not to any other site which may be linked to by this site.

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this privacy policy, please feel free to [contact me](http://www.seobythesea.com/?page_id=450).

I recommend that anyone using the Web learn more about privacy issues online, and suggest the following resources as good places to begin to find out more on the topic:

  * [Electonic Privacy Information Center](http://epic.org/)
  * [Privacy.org](http://privacy.org/)
  * [Federal Trade Commission – Privacy Initiatives](http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/)
