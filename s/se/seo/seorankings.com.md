# Privacy Policy | SEO Rankings.com

At SEOrankings.com, we respect your privacy. When you send us e-mails, subscribe to our newsletter or feeds, purchase products and services, sign up for special reports, post blog comments, or request information, some personal information is collected in order to communicate with you.

We do not share this information with third parties except where necessary to provide the service you want from us. In these cases, the information is used only for the specific service you wanted from us.

In addition, here is a summary of what can happen when you visit this website:

**Log Files & Analytics**  
As with most other websites, our servers automatically recognizes your domain name and IP address, and we may use it to track additional information in an effort to improve the quality of this website. We can only personally identify you if you post comments, sign-up for products and services or communicate with us directly.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**  
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.

At times, we may also use third party advertisements on our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons, which will also send these advertisers information about your visit to our website. If you visit those websites, you will need to review their privacy policies individually.

DoubleClick DART cookies  
We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Seattle, you may see Seattle hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about golf). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx.

You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to certain services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.

**Policy Changes, Questions & Comments**  
Our privacy policy may change at any time. We’ll post changes to this policy on this page. Additional questions about this policy should be emailed using [this form](http://www.seorankings.com/contact).
