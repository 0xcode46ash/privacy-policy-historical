# Privacy Policy

SES ASTRA (ASTRA) is sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet. We believe it is important you know how we treat the information about you we receive on the Internet.

In general, you can visit SES ASTRA on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our Web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. SES ASTRA uses this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site.

There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. When information is needed, we will let you know, at the time of collection, how we will use the personal information. Usually, the personal information we collect is used only by us to respond to your inquiry, process an order or allow you to access specific account information. 

You will be entitled to object at any time, for compelling and legitimate reasons relating to your special situations, to the processing of your data, except in case where legal provisions expressly provide for that processing. Where there is a justified objection, the processing may not involved your data.

Occasionally, we may make the e-mail addresses of those who provide information, available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you may find interesting. In these cases, you will be offered an opportunity to limit access to your information.

If you register with one of SES ASTRA's business units online, they may use this information to provide you with custom information about SES ASTRA's offering in support of your business needs. A technology called cookies may be used to provide you with tailored information. A cookie is a tiny element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.

At times we conduct online surveys to better understand the needs and profile of our visitors. 

When we conduct a survey, we will try to let you know how we will use the information at the time we collect information from you on the Internet.

You will have a right of access to the data collected and a right of rectification of the data in cases where such data is inaccurate and incomplete. You will be informed of the contact person at the time of the collect of data.

All data related information shall not be held for longer than necessary with regard to the purpose of the data processing, observing the legal periods of limitation.

If you require information or permission in relation with intellectual property matters, please contact [info@ses-astra.com. ](mailto:info@ses-astra.com)
