# SES ASTRA - Privacy Policy

SES ASTRA (ASTRA) is sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet. We believe it is important you know how we treat the information about you we receive on the Internet.

In general, you can visit SES ASTRA on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our Web servers collect IP addresses, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. and is used by SES ASTRA to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site. Companies doing the tracking and measurement for SES ASTRA such as eTracker, Google and WebTrends also have access to the information.

There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. When information is needed, we will let you know, at the time of collection, how we will use the personal information. Usually, the personal information we collect is used only by us to respond to your inquiry, process an order or allow you to access specific account information.

If you register on our website and accept the terms of our privacy policy we will log your visit to see which products and services you are specifically interested in. This information is only used by us to improve our understanding of your specific needs.

You will be entitled to object at any time by sending an e-mail to [info@ses-astra.com](mailto:info@ses-astra.com), for compelling and legitimate reasons relating to your special situations, to the processing of your data, except in case where legal provisions expressly provide for that processing. Where there is a justified objection, the processing may not involve your data.

Occasionally, we may make the e-mail addresses and additional data of those who provide information, available to other fully integrated members of the SES group of companies whose products or services we think you may find interesting and who strictly observe your privacy rights. In these cases, you will be offered an opportunity to limit access to your information.

On some products, where you have shown a specific interest, we will point out that we will forward your information to our partners for such product, however only subject to your prior approval.

If you register with one of SES ASTRA's business units online, they may use this information to provide you with custom information about SES ASTRA's offering in support of your business needs. A technology called cookies may be used to provide you with tailored information. A cookie is a tiny element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.

At times we conduct online surveys to better understand the needs and profile of our visitors.

When we conduct a survey, we will let you know how we will use the information at the time we collect information from you on the Internet.

You will have a right of access to the data collected and a right of rectification of the data in cases where such data is inaccurate and incomplete.

All data related information shall not be held for longer than necessary with regard to the purpose of the data processing, observing the legal periods of limitation.

If you require information or permission in relation with the privacy policy, please contact [info@ses-astra.com.](mailto:info@ses-astra.com)
