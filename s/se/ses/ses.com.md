**Information collection and use**

In general, you can visit SES on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our Web servers collect IP addresses of visitors only. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. and is used by SES to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site. You cannot be identified from this information and it is only used to assist us in providing an effective service on this web site. Companies doing the tracking and measurement for SES also have access to this information.

On those occasions where you do provide and consent to our use of your personal information, we will only collect and use that personal information (e.g. name, address, telephone number and email) in order to:

  * respond to inquiries submitted by you 
  * process orders or applications submitted by you 
  * allow you to access specific account information, i.e., company Extranet 
  * create and improve our products or services.



From time to time we would like to use the personal information you supply to us for:

  * market research and tracking of sales data 
  * informing you about our products and services
  * giving the information to our SES affiliates, which may be located outside the EEA, to enable them to send you information which may be of interest to you.



As part of the services offered to you through our site, the personal information you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA; however, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

Except as set out in this Privacy policy, we will not disclose any personally identifiable information without your permission unless we are legally required to do so, in order to protect the legitimate interest of the company or to protect your vital interests.

If at any time you wish us to stop using your personal information for any or all of the aforementioned purposes, please let us know time by sending an e-mail to [info@ses.com](mailto:%20info@ses.com). We will cease the use of your information for such purposes as soon as it is reasonably possible to do so.
