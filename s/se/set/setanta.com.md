# Privacy Policy | Setanta

### SETANTA SPORTS CUSTOMER AND WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY  


Setanta Sport Australia Pty Limited ACN 086 130 805 (“we”) is a provider of subscription sports television programs. In order for us to effectively provide our services to customers, we collect certain personal information. Such information may include your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, bank details and credit card details.  


### Why we collect personal information

  
The primary purpose of the collection of personal information is to maintain our database of customers so that we may effectively communicate with you, provide information about our services and facilitate receipt of payment from you. We may also use your personal information to provide you with information about our services, programs, events, functions or news updates that may be relevant or of interest to you. We generally ask you when you subscribe if you would like to be contacted for these purposes. If you do not wish to be contacted for these purposes you can let us know at any time by contacting us at the details below.  


### How we collect personal information

Personal information may be collected from you in a number of ways, for example:   
• when you contact us or subscribe to our services by telephone;  
• when you contact us or subscribe to our services by email or via our website;  
• when you update an on-line profile that includes personal information such as your name and contact details; and  
• when we request certain information from subscribers for a specific purpose.  


Our website may use “cookies” (these are files that are implanted in your hard drive by some websites to store information about your web use patterns) to enhance or personalise our website services. We may in any case collect anonymous information that allows us to review information about the date, time and duration of visits to our website without identifying you. We may also aggregate personal information of our customers for statistical purposes. We do this in order to better inform ourselves of our customers’ preferences and requirements, and to enable us to monitor the effectiveness of, and constantly improve, our website and our services. 

### Disclosure and Use of Information 

We may disclose personal information to related entities and to service providers who we may engage to assist us to deliver services such as security and technology services.

We may also disclose personal information to third party companies and partners with whom we have a relationship. We may do this for instance to investigate or promote new products, services or offers which we think may be of interest or benefit to you.

We may use or disclose personal information as follows:  
• for the purpose for which it was collected;   
• where you have consented to such use;   
• to maintain our relationship with you;   
• to inform you about new products or services;  
• to the extent that we are required or authorised to do so by law; or   
• for any other purpose that we may notify you of or that you have specifically approved prior to such disclosure.   
You may withdraw your consent to use your personal information at any time. To withdraw this consent please contact us at the details below. Please note that withdrawing your consent may mean that we are unable to provide you with certain services.

We may sell, transfer, or otherwise disclose our database of personal information to a successor entity or purchaser in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of our assets or substantially all our assets, or other corporate change involving our services.

### Security

Once in our possession, we take all reasonable precautions to protect the personal information we hold about you from misuse, loss and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We use a number of technological mechanisms to provide a secure environment. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. We therefore cannot warrant the security of any information you provide to us over the Internet and you do so at your own risk.   
We aim to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete and up to date. To assist us, please contact us if any of the details provided have changed or if you believe that the information we hold is inaccurate. You may request us to provide you with access to the personal information we hold about you at any time. We will respond to your access request as soon as possible, however, prior to disclosing any such information it will be necessary for you to satisfactorily verify your identity.
