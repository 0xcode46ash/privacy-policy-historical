## Collection of Personal Information

To provide you with account services and / or payment processing, we must obtain certain personal information, such as, without being limited to, name, email and/or phone number as well as your company information. For certain optional transactions, we will require selected financial information such as credit card details. For high value transactions, we are legally obliged to report certain mandatory personal identification information to the authorities. For verification purposes we reserve the right to request proof of identification in an offline format. Your IP address and access times are tracked against your user id for the dual purpose of preventing fraud and creating an audit trail when sending a payment or logging onto our secure server. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site and link the information we store in cookies to any personal identification information you submit while on our site.

## Use of Personal Information

We only use your personal information to service your account and to improve our services to you. However, we do share some financial information as part of normal business operations with banks or credit card processing and verification services. These entities may not use your information for secondary purposes, unless required by law. Although we make every effort to preserve your privacy we may be obliged to disclose your personal information by law, regulation or court order. Save for the above, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES will information you provide to Setcom be transmitted in any way to a third party.

## Control of Personal Information

If a merchant's personal identification information changes (such as your area code, phone number, email or postal address), you must request the relevant corrections and updates to your account by submitting a written request to Setcom via email. If a merchant no longer desires to use our services, you may request the closure of your account in writing. However, we cannot completely delete merchant information because of legal/regulatory and technical back up requirements.

## Communication

Upon registration merchants will receive correspondence from our technical support team, who will provide integration details and guidance. Merchants will occasionally receive information on products, services and special deals via newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our merchants, we give you the option of choosing not to receive these types of communications by selecting the "Unsubscribe" option on any newsletter received.
