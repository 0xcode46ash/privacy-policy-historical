**a. All Site Visitors** \- SEMPO collects data provided by your web browser, such as your IP address, to help diagnose problems with our server and to analyze paths through our Web site. This data also provides broad demographic information about our audience which we use to improve the SEMPO web site (for example, how many international users do we have, how many users use version 4.0 of Netscape, etc). 

Under certain circumstances SEMPO may issue cookies to users when they come to our Web site to allow us to learn how many unique visitors we have, to aid in analyzing navigation paths through our site, and to maintain login information during a member's session.  Cookie tracking identifies you by using a unique number; personal information such as name and address are only correlated with cookie information to allow us to manage member login sessions. 

Other companies which place advertising on our site also have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that SEMPO does not control. However, cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines, so these advertisers will not know who you are.
