We may collect IP addresses, as explained below.

**Cookies**

  
Like many companies, we use "cookies" on our websites. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain websites. We use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify site features in which you may have the greatest interest. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.

Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all our website features.

**Web Beacons**

  
Certain pages on our websites contain "web beacons" (also know as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party.

**IP Addresses**  
An IP address is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. When you visit our websites, we may view the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. We use this information to determine the general physical location of the device and understand from what regions of the world our website visitors come. We also may use this information to enhance our websites.

**INFORMATION WE SHARE**  
We do not sell or otherwise disclose information about our website visitors, except as described here. We may share the information you provide among our subsidiaries and affiliates, and with Brunswick business partners, such as our joint marketing partners and dealers and distributors of our products. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity or (iv) if this is necessary to protect the vital interests of the a person.

If you are a California resident, you may ask us to refrain from sharing your information with third parties and among our affiliates for their marketing purposes, if the affiliates are separate legal entities. Please tell us your preference by contacting us as indicated in the "How to Contact Us" section of this Notice.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use information you have provided through our websites in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.

**LINKS TO OTHER SITES**  
Our websites may provide links to other websites for your convenience and information. These websites may operate independently from this site. Linked sites may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked websites. To the extent any linked websites you visit are not part of this site, we are not responsible for their content, any use of the sites, or the privacy practices of the sites.

We may transfer the personal information we collect on this site to other countries where we do business, which may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you reside. When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described here, even though a given country may not have the same privacy and data protection laws as the country in which you reside.

**CANADA AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS**
