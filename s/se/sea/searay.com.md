**PRIVACY POLICY**

**Our Commitment to Privacy**

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are responsible for checking this policy when you visit our Site to review the current policy. By using this Site, you agree to our use of the information we collect about you as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, you should cease use of this Site immediately. Last update: 6/6/2004. 

**In General**  
You may visit this Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about you. Unless otherwise disclosed during the collection, personally identifiable information that may be collected in connection with visitors to this Site is retained by Sea Ray. We may process or store this personally identifiable information in our U.S. database. 

**What Information We Collect and Why**   
When you visit our Site you may provide us with two types of information: (1) personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis, and (2) Site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Site. 

Personally identifiable information, such as email and email address, first and last name, home or other physical address, telephone numbers, credit and/or debit card information and other similar information are collected only when voluntarily provided. For example, when a user orders a brochure online, the user voluntarily provides information about his current boat ownership, purchase plans and cruising or sportfishing preference. This information is used for targeted direct mail campaigns and follow up mailings. Both Sea Ray and a third party responsible for the mailings get this user information. 

Our servers collect the following Web site use information: the domain names, operating system in use (e.g., Macintosh, Windows), browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), and the web site that referred you to us. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Site, pages viewed, time and date of visits, and other similar information. Sea Ray uses this information to measure the use of our Site and to improve the content of our Site. 

Sea Ray does not sell, share, transfer or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information to third parties, except to our affiliates, business partners, contractors, and marketing consultants or where disclosure is required by law. Consequently, we may transfer your information to countries throughout the world wherever we or such third parties conduct business. We may additionally use, store, disclose or otherwise process the personal information you provide for any of the following purposes: 

  * to understand the use of our Site and make improvements;
  * to respond to specific requests or inquiries from visitors;
  * to obtain parental consent from visitors under 18 years of age, where necessary;
  * to provide any necessary notices to our visitors or their parent or guardian;
  * to protect the security or integrity of our Site when necessary;
  * to send you notices and solicitations regarding the Site and the products and services of our businesses and those of our affiliates and business partners;
  * to send brochures and other marketing materials, if requested; and
  * in general, to promote, market, and distribute our various businesses and products, and those of our affiliates and business partners to you. 



These solicitations may take the form of mailings via U.S. mail or other couriers, telephone calls, e-mail solicitations and other methods of contact. If you do not want to receive these solicitations from us using the personally identifiable information provided by you on this Site, you may specify this during registration where and if indicated, or you may notify Terry Domian, AVALA Marketing Group, 1078 Headquarters Park Drive, Fenton, MO 63026, Phone: 636-343-9988, Fax: 636-326-3282, E-mail: [terryd@avalamarketing.com](mailto:terryd@avalamarketing.com) or Suzi Rice, AVALA Marketing Group, 1078 Headquarters Park Drive, Fenton, MO 63026, Phone: 636-343-9988, Fax: 636-326-3282, E-mail: [suzir@avalamarketing.com](mailto:suzir@avalamarketing.com).

**Email Information**  
If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. 

**Cookies**  
Similar to other commercial Web sites, a technology called “cookies” may be used to provide you with tailored information. A cookie is a small piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. You may be able to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. Our cookies collect the operating system and browser that a visitor is using. The goal is to save you time and provide a more meaningful visit. 

**Users Under Age 13**  
It is our policy that visitors to our Site who are under the age of 13 should not post or provide information on our Site without the consent of their parents. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Web Site is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

**Links to Other Web Sites**  
When you use a link to go from our Site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Site nor for the information or content contained therein.

**How We Secure Information**  
When you send confidential personal credit card information to us on our Site, it is encrypted and securely relayed to a third party credit card processor, who subsequently sends an authorization code back to the Site. Your confidential personal credit card information is not stored or otherwise retained by Sea Ray in any way.
