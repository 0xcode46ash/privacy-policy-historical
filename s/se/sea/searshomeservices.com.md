We use single sign-on services that allow you to sign into this Site using your third-party social networking login credentials for accounts such as Facebook, Google or Twitter.

#### Can I Disable Cookies?

Most web browsers allow you to exercise control over cookie files on your computer by erasing them, blocking them, or notifying you when such a file is stored. Please take a look at your particular browser for instructions on this function.

We may also use Flash Cookies, LSOs and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services, fraud prevention and other site operations. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the [Website Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the [Global Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html) and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Services or our online content.

#### Interest-Based Ads - Online Advertisements

This Site may display ads from other companies. We also partner with third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf on other non-affiliated third party Sites. Some of the ads on this Site or on third party Sites may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on what we or the online advertising network serving the ad know about you or your computer's browsing activity. For example, anonymous information collected across multiple Sites that you visit may enable the ad network to predict your preferences and show you ads that are most likely to be of interest to you. Please note that we do not share any information that identifies you personally with the third party service providers who serve ads on our behalf.

If you do not wish to receive personalized advertising from us on other Sites, please visit the [Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) page. To learn more about interest based advertising and to manage your preferences for Sears and Kmart branded online ads, please visit the [Sears Online Advertising Preference Center](http://www.sears.com/trusteprivacy/dap-120000000391831) or the [Kmart Online Advertising Preference Center](http://www.kmart.com/trusteprivacy/dap-120000000391830).

The Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about internet advertising companies, including information about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by their members. See [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) for general information about the NAI. You may also visit <http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/> to learn about online behavioral advertising and how to opt-out from online behavioral ads served by some or all participating companies.

If you delete your cookies, use another computer or device, or change browsers, you will need to repeat this process. In addition, opting out of interest-based ads will not opt you out of all ads, but rather only those ads that are personalized to your interests based on activities observed on web sites or mobile apps not owned and operated by Sears Holdings.

#### Is My Information Secure?

We maintain reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your PII. While we do work very hard to protect your privacy, no method of security is 100% effective, and we cannot be responsible for the actions of those who may gain unauthorized access to your PII. Sears Holdings makes no warranties, express, implied or otherwise, as to the ultimate effectiveness of its reasonable and appropriate safeguards.
