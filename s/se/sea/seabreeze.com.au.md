# Privacy Policy

#### Information Collected

When becoming a member of the Seabreeze.com.au website, you are requested to enter personal contact details.

You can view your publicly available information at any time by visiting the "My Profile" links available on most pages of the site. 

Your contact details (such as emails, phone numbers and addresses) are kept private and are not disseminated to any third parties whatsoever. (Note that your First & Last Names are displayed in your public profile, but can easily be edited out in [Edit My Profile](https://web.archive.org/Members/Profile/EditMyDetails.aspx?member=laurie).)

We value our privacy and treat your information with respect.

**Mailouts**

We send very rare mailouts, and an unsubscribe option is at the bottom of any mailout. To stop receiving these, simply Visit [Edit My Profile](https://web.archive.org/Members/Profile/EditMyDetails.aspx?member=laurie), and uncheck the "I don't mind an occasional email newsletter" checkbox. If this is all too hard, [send us an email](https://web.archive.org/members/extras/feedback.aspx), and we'll help you out!

**Please Note!** You should avoid posting your email address publicly in the forums or classifieds unless absolutely necessary.  There are many programs available that scan websites such as seabreeze.com.au and "harvest" emails that are published on the sites pages (including the forums).    By posting your email publicly on this site, please understand that it is out of our control (and yours) whether you then start to receive unsolicited emails from unconnected companies (i.e. spam )
