### Security

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at [privacy@seatwave.com](mailto:privacy@seatwave.com).

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

### Disclosures

We use a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. We will disclose your Name, Billing Address and Credit Card Information to these credit card processing companies. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.

Business Transitions: In the event Seatwave Ltd goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified either via or through a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

### Hyperlinks to other web sites

This Site contains hyperlinks to web sites owned and operated by third parties. These web sites have their own privacy policies and we urge you to review them. They will govern the use of Personal Information you submit whilst visiting these web sites. Seatwave does not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party web sites and your use of such web sites is at your own risk. 

### Cookies

When you view our Site we may store information on the hard drive of your computer in the form of a "cookie" (essentially a small text file). Cookies allow us to tailor the Site to your interests and preferences. For example, a cookie might contain information about the web pages you have visited on the Site, which could allow us to customise your next visit to the Site. However, cookies do not allow us access to the rest of your computer and we do not use them to collect Personal Information about you.

Most Internet browsers enable you to delete cookies or to receive a warning before a cookie is stored on your hard drive. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about how to do this. However, should you decide to disable any cookies we place on your computer you may not be able to use certain services or facilities on this Site.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers or analytics companies) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. 

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Seatwave only and does not cover the use of cookies by any business partners.

### IP Addresses

We study visitor trends since we are interested in the successful dissemination of information through the Site. Our server creates log files of information such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address from your network, what pages were explored and the length of your visit. Analysis software is used to generate reports, which helps us to learn more about how we can enhance your experience with the Site. This information is not used to develop a personal profile of you. The log files are regularly purged.

An IP address is a number designated for your computer by your Internet service provider to provide access to the Internet. Generally, an IP address will change every time your computer connects to the Internet. However, if you have a broadband connection, it is possible that the IP address that we may gather may contain information that may be deemed identifiable. This could occur due to the fact that by using certain broadband connections, your IP address would not change and could be associated with your personal computer. We may use your IP address to gather aggregate information on use. But we will only be able to identify you individually if we have the means of linking the IP address to you as a particular user. This usually requires access to additional information which we do not seek.

### Transfers to other countries

Your Personal Information is stored and processed on our servers outside the European Economic Area and may be accessed globally. However, wherever we process your information we will strive to ensure the same level of protection promised in this Privacy Policy, which means that your Personal Information will be protected at all times in accordance with strict data protection standards.

###  Your right to see your Personal Information 

You have the right to request a copy of the Personal Information that Seatwave holds on you and to have any errors in that information corrected. We charge £10.00 for such requests. Please address your request to our customer service team at [support@seatwave.com](mailto:support@seatwave.com). We will use reasonable efforts to supply, correct or delete Personal Information about you on our files.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. If you have any queries about this Privacy Policy please email [privacy@seatwave.com](mailto:privacy@seatwave.com).
