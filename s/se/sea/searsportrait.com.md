### Privacy & Security Policies  
With A Special Note To Parents  


Sears Portrait Studio takes care to respect the privacy and security of its on-line visitors. Non-personal information is collected from on-line visitors so that we may continually improve upon visitor's on-line experiences. For example, the total number of visitors in aggregate form is tracked and the types of Internet browsers (e.g. Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) and operating systems (e.g. Windows 95 or Macintosh) used is sorted. Personal information, such as a visitor's name, street address, e-mail address and the like is only collected in two areas: on our contest pages when voluntarily submitted by the visitor, and on our birthday club enrollment form when voluntarily submitted by the visitor. In our Story Creation area, personal information is collected when voluntarily submitted by the visitor, for entertainment purposes only. For example, a visitor may choose to submit personal information in response to a contest entry form or choose to sign up for automatic email messages from Sears Portrait Studio. Subscribers have the option of "un-subscribing" at any time. Personal information will be used solely by Sears Portrait Studio or its agents for internal purposes, and will not be sold or otherwise transferred to third parties. Please see our Special Note to Parents below. 

### A Special Note To Parents

Sears Portrait Studio recognizes that the Internet is a unique communications medium, and we are committed to ensuring that the Company's fair and ethical practices are continued on-line. Sears Portrait Studio is especially mindful of the need for children to consult with their parents before furnishing personal information or ordering products on-line, and we will make special efforts to advise children to do so. We also urge parents to monitor and supervise all of their children's on-line activities, and recommend that parents become sophisticated in the availability and use of software and other tools that may enhance children's on-line experiences in manners reflective of parental preferences.
