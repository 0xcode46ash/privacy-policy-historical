In some instances, we will share your contact information with carefully selected service providers to assist us in processing your online transactions or to deliver the services requested. For example, if you are a patron who requests information about a certain event hosted by one of our clients, we will supply your contact information to our clients who will then contact you to complete your request. SeatAdvisor, Inc. may use a third party vendor who will process and mail information, and other materials you request on SeatAdvisor, Inc.'s behalf.

We will also share your personal information with carefully selected non-affiliated companies who provide special offers on behalf of SeatAdvisor, Inc.. For example, SeatAdvisor, Inc. may offer a free demo or information packet to prospective clients upon speaking with an advisor for a complimentary consultation. Potential Clients who request more information may have their information shared with a third party company only for purposes of ensuring that the potential client receives the information requested.

We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our users' needs.

In order to make your visit to our website as productive as possible, we track activity on our website. However, we want you to know that the tracking technology we use does not identify any personal information about you. They cannot retrieve data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture any personal information about you, such as your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. We only know who you are if you tell us. You may, however, be asked to provide personal information such as name, address, phone number or e-mail address to us when you register for online services or products.

**Cookies:** One way we track activity is by using cookies. A "cookie" is an electronic file that holds small strings of text. When you visit our website, we send a cookie to your browser so that we can recognize it when you or another user of your computer return to our website. We want to recognize your browser so we can make the best use of your time when visiting our website.

**Advertising** : When you visit our website by clicking on certain banner ads or special offers on our partners' website, we track this information to improve navigation and deliver relevant information when you arrive at our website. We also do this because we want to determine if our ads and special offers are appealing to our users.

**Browser settings** : You can adjust many browser preferences so that you are alerted when a cookie is placed in your browser, or adjust preferences to decline cookies altogether. Recognize that cookies enable you to visit our website without reviewing introductory information. In addition to allowing us to recognize you.

We recognize that e-mail can be the preferred mode of communication for some of our patrons and clients. If you provide us with your e-mail address when registering for an online service or product or when accessing your account online, we will use it to contact you about online services and products for which you have registered or about your account.

  * Service notifications related to your accounts
  * Regularly scheduled e-mail information related to SeatAdvisor, Inc.
  * Product or service information
  * Optional e-mail communications which you have signed up for (e.g. newsletters)
  * Occasional updates about our products and services as well as SeatAdvisor, Inc. marketing offers



Also, once you have requested information from us, we may communicate with you via e-mail regarding your request to provide additional information related to your initial information request. For example, we may send you materials to help you prepare for an upcoming meeting with an SeatAdvisor, Inc. advisor. However, we will never ask you to send personal information such as account or Social Security numbers by non-secure e-mail.

To make our e-mail more relevant to you, we may use information you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys, from information we have about you as a patron or client and information available from external sources.

We do not share your e-mail address with non-affiliated companies for them to market their products or services directly to you. However, we may partner with selected non-affiliated companies to offer certain products or services we believe may be of interest to you.

You may receive e-mail offers from other companies for SeatAdvisor, Inc. products and services if you registered to receive third-party offers on their website, or if you receive ongoing e-mail newsletters from the other companies that include third-party ads. If you have recently opted out of receiving e-mail offers from SeatAdvisor, Inc., we will process and honor your request as soon as administratively possible. In certain circumstances, you may receive e-mail offers for SeatAdvisor, Inc. products and services during the time period when we are processing your opt-out request.

To opt-out of receiving offers or e-mail newsletters from other companies, follow the instructions provided by those companies.

SeatAdvisor, Inc. may use third parties to place banner ads on other websites and will perform tracking and reporting activities through use of Ad Servers. We do not provide Ad Servers with your personal information and Ad Servers do not collect your personal information. Ad Servers are subject to their own privacy policies.

SeatAdvisor, Inc. realizes how important security is to you, so we've taken a number of steps to enhance the protection of personal or confidential information sent to, or from SeatAdvisor, Inc. over the Internet. First, we require that a "secure session" be established, using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Technology. This is done any time you supply or access personal or confidential information in one of our secure online areas.

SSL Technology creates a private conversation that only your computer and SeatAdvisor, Inc. systems can understand. The SSL Technology encodes information as it is being sent over the Internet between your computer and SeatAdvisor, Inc. systems, helping to ensure that the transmitted information remains confidential. The use of SSL requires two components: an SSL-compatible browser and a Web server to perform the "key-exchange" that establishes a secure connection to SeatAdvisor, Inc. Web server systems. In addition, all of our secure sites require that your browser support 128-bit encryption.

In order to securely access your personal information via our website, you will need the latest browser version available with SSL and 128 bit encryption capabilities.

Second, client designated areas of the site require the use of a User ID and Password as an additional security measure that helps protect your confidential information. This allows SeatAdvisor, Inc. to verify who you are, thereby allowing you access to your account information, and preventing unauthorized access. It is the client's responsibility to maintain their user accounts and SeatAdvisor will not be held liable for any misuse of account access.

When a client has finished using a secure area of SeatAdvisor, Inc., make sure you always click on the "Log Out" link which appears on the top of every page. When you click on it, no further management transactions can be conducted without re-entering your User ID and Password. This also helps prevent unauthorized access to your account if you walk away from your computer.

You should be aware that browser software often "caches" a page as you look at it, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer's temporary memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your "Back" button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in no way affects the security of your confidential User ID or Password. If you use a computer in a public place to access your account information, simply quit/exit the browser software before leaving to minimize the possibility of anyone else accessing your account.

Third, in order to bring you the many online products and services offered through [seatadvisor.com](http://www.seatadvisor.com/), we work with carefully selected vendors and non-affiliated companies. If we have to share any information with these companies in order to provide a product or service to you, we first conduct a careful evaluation of their information and security systems and practices, and require administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of SeatAdvisor, Inc. client information. At any time, we may audit these companies to verify the continued security of their systems and practices.

Lastly, you should be aware that other Internet sites that you link to from the SeatAdvisor, Inc. site or an SeatAdvisor, Inc. e-mail may contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of our Privacy Statement. To ensure your privacy is protected, we recommend that you review the privacy statements of other Internet sites you visit.

We strive to send you e-mail communications that are informative and relevant, but also appreciate that you are in the best position to evaluate the type and frequency of our communications to you.

There are two types of e-mail communications we will send to you: service communications and marketing communications. Service communications may include information about your online registration, verification that your account has been accessed online, in response to a service related inquiry or confirmation of an online transaction. Marketing communications may include information about SeatAdvisor, Inc.'s services and products, newsletters, and joint or special offers or information from our selected non-affiliated companies and SeatAdvisor, Inc. affiliates.

To opt-out of receiving e-mail offers or newsletters, send us an [e-mail message](mailto:%65%78%70%72%65%73%73%40%73%65%61%74%61%64%76%69%73%6f%72%2e%63%6f%6d) requesting you be removed from our mailing list. Note: If you are a patron who wishes to opt out of a venue's e-mail marketing you must contact the client directly. You may receive separate newsletters pertaining to different SeatAdvisor, Inc. products and services that you are enrolled in automatically when you register for those products or services. In this case, you must request to be removed individually. If you opt-out, we will still send you e-mail with service updates as well as other important information related to the SeatAdvisor, Inc. online products or services for which you have signed up.

Because SeatAdvisor Inc, is a private labeled software provider, Our clients present their event listings in a framed browser window the page may not contain the familiar security indicators including the small "lock" icon at the bottom right corner of the browser frame and the "s" in the address bar (for example, "https"). Please be assured that although these indicators are not present in the master page, the checkout component of this page is secure.

To verify that this page is secure and that your credit card number and personal information is being transmitted with an SSL-encrypted page, you may right click on the checkout page and view information about the page (most browsers work this way). You will see that the page is using 'https' indicating an SSL-Encrypted page.

Please feel free to [contact us](http://www.seatadvisor.com/contact/contact.html) directly with questions regarding check-out security.
