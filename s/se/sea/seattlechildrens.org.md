If a user so requests, we may use the contact information to send the user additional information about Children's. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below). Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address). The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary. Again, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below).
