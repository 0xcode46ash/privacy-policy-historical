**What Type of Information Does SHC Collect?**

SHC collects personally identifiable information (for example, your full name, email address, mailing address, or telephone number “PII”) from you when you voluntarily submit the information to us in order to apply for a job, submit your resume for an employment opportunity, or ask for additional information. SHC may also collect PII from you if you choose to participate in SHC activities like sweepstakes, contests, and surveys, or in connection with content or suggestions you post on SHC.

SHC collects non-personally identifiable information (for example, interests, hobbies, lifestyle choices, groups with whom you are affiliated “non-PII”) from you when you choose to provide or post non-PII information on SHC.

SHC also collects non-PII from you by means of Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that SHC places on your computer. SHC uses cookies to identify your IP address, browser type, domain name, and specific web pages through which you click. This data is collected automatically and utilized to help SHC look for trends to improve our website and your SHC experience. The cookies allow SHC to recognize you when you return to the Website and to provide you with a customized experience that SHC feels will be of value to you. The cookies that are configured by SHC do not contain any personally identifying information, such as your name, or sensitive information, such as your credit card number. Additional information regarding computer cookies and how to disable them is described below.

SHC may collect demographic information (such as number of household members, age, and gender) and purchase preference information about you from third parties. We use this information to customize your experience on our website and on other Sears Holdings family of business websites and to provide you with the most relevant products and services.

**What Information Does SHC Share and with Whom?**

SHC does not rent or sell your information to outside marketers. SHC may share your information (as described above) with members of the Sears Holdings family of businesses to provide you with products or services that you have requested or to provide you with promotional offers that SHC believes will be of interest to you. The Sears Holdings family of businesses includes all Sears Holdings affiliates, as well as other selected businesses with which Sears Holdings and its affiliates have a relationship and which have agreed to adhere to our strict standards for providing quality products and services, responding to your needs, and protecting customer information.

In certain circumstances, SHC may share your information with service providers that need access to your information to provide operational or other support services. To ensure the confidentiality and security of your information, service providers must agree to safeguard your information in strict compliance with this policy.

SHC also may provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law or when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it. There may be instances when SHC may access or disclose your information to protect or defend the legal rights or property of SHC and its affiliated companies or their employees and agents, to protect the safety and security of users and members of SHC, and to protect against fraud.

SHC may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets in connection with a merger, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. In such an event, personal information may be one of the assets transferred.

SHC may contain links to other websites. SHC is not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. SHC users should read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.

**What About Advertisements from Third Parties?**

SHC may also carry advertisements from other companies. SHC is not responsible for the privacy practices of third party Internet advertising companies. Once you click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine, among other things, how they will handle any PII they collect from you. Third party advertisements may also contain cookies or web beacons. SHC does not control these third party cookies or web beacons and you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to see whether and how it uses cookies or web beacons. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about Internet advertising companies; also know as ad networks, including information about how to opt-out of their information collections.

**Is My Information Secure?**

SHC takes appropriate precautions to protect users’ information. Your information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter PII, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”).
