### What Personal Information About Customers Does Sealy.com Gather?

Here are the types of information we gather.

### Information You Give Us

We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way (such as providing information to enter a contest or communicate with our customer service department). In those cases, we ordinarily collect your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. You can choose not to provide information. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests and registering your warranty.

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Sealy.com. Scroll to the bottom of this page to see examples of the information we receive.

Sealy.Com uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

We work closely with our business partners, an example of which is Experian. Youâ€™ll have an opportunity to choose not to share the information with Experian or our other business partners.

### Agents

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include sending postal mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes

### Business Transfers

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Sealy, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
