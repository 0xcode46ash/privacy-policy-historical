# Segway - Privacy

### Privacy

#### We value your privacy.

###### Privacy Statement

Protecting your privacy is a Segway top priority. This statement discloses the information practices for Segway's Web sites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. By visiting www.segway.com, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Statement, as modified from time to time by us.

What kinds of Information we collect and how we use it

  * **Registration and Interactive Forms**  
A user may wish to register on our site to receive informational and promotional email materials such as newsletters and product release announcements and participate in surveys. Users may also use a form to submit feedback to our site, or use a form to contact us.

For ordinary users, only a name and email address is requested for these interactions. For business users, we also request additional information about the business, including the company name, address, and phone number. All such contacts and registrations are voluntary on the part of the user; therefore the user has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

  * **Fulfilling your transaction request**  
If you request something from Segway Inc., such as a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share relevant information with others such as shipping carriers, product orientation providers, merchant bankers, postal or government authorities (for example, custom authorities) involved in the fulfillment. In connection with a transaction, we may also contact you as a part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.

  * **Affiliated Businesses**  
For a limited time, Segway PTs are available for purchase online exclusively through Amazon.com. In order to fulfill customer orders, Amazon.com will transfer the following customer information to us and a third-party product orientation company: Customer's name, address, email address, units ordered, and amount of deposit collected. Customers will be sent an email from Segway Inc. with instructions on how to complete their order, balance due, and shipping information when their units are ready to ship.

  * **With Your Consent** Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

  * **Cookies**  
A cookie is a small amount of data that often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a Web site's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser, if your browser's preferences allow it, but to protect your privacy, your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies stored on your computer by other sites.




Segway uses cookies to store your user ID on your computer, allowing use of interactive areas on our Web site. The cookie is placed on your computer only when you log into interactive sections of our Web site and is removed once you have closed your Web browser.

You can configure your Web browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the Help menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) You may reject all cookies sent to you without experiencing any loss of web site functionality.

###### Security

Segway takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users' information both online and off-line. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.

###### Log Files

We use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement on our Web site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. These log files contain statistical data used to analyze traffic patterns, specifically the user's IP address, the date and time of the visit, the file requested by the user, the size of the file requested by the user, the status of the request (e.g., whether the request was successfully served by our Web server software), and the referring URL which generated the request. This log data is not tied in with any personally identifiable information and is used in aggregate form only. We will not share demographic information, aggregated or otherwise, with anyone.

###### Links and Business Relationships

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Segway is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Segway.com.

###### Correcting/Updating Personal Information

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your postal code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can be done by emailing [webmaster@segway.com](mailto:webmaster@segway.com).

###### Choice/Opt-in

Our users are given the opportunity to opt-in to having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site (such as receiving our occasional e-mail newsletter) on the site's registration pages.

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials (such as information on products, services, special deals) may stop receiving these communications by emailing us at [unsubscribe@segway.com](mailto:unsubscribe@segway.com).
