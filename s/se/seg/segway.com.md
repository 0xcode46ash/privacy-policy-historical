**International Policies**  
Segway abides by the principles of the safe harbor privacy framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of data from the EU. For more information on this framework please refer to the Department of Commerce’s EU Safe Harbor website at: <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

**Information Collection and Use**  
Segway is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We collect information from our users at several different points on our Web site to allow users to sign up to receive information such as newsletters and product release announcements and to participate in surveys. We will not sell, share, or rent any of this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small amount of data that often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a Web site's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. 

Segway uses cookies to store your user ID on your computer, allowing personalization of our Web site. The cookie is placed on your computer only when you log into our Web site and is removed when you log out.

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) You may reject all cookies sent to you without experiencing any loss of Web site functionality. 

**Security**  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information both online and off-line. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online. 

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. These log files contain statistical data used to analyze traffic patterns, specifically the user's Internet Protocol (IP) address, the date and time of the visit, the file requested by the user, the size of the file requested by the user, the status of the request (e.g., whether the request was successfully served by our Web server software), and the referring URL that generated the request. This data is not tied in with any personally identifiable information and is used in aggregate form only. We will not share demographic information, aggregated or otherwise, with anyone.

**Links/Business Relationships**  
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Segway is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**Registration and Interactive Forms**  
A user may wish to register on our site to receive informational and promotional email materials, use a form to submit feedback to our site, or use a form to contact us. For ordinary users, only a name and email address are requested for these interactions. For business users, we also request information about the employee’s business, including their company’s name, address, and phone number. All such contacts and registrations are voluntary on the part of the user, therefore the user has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. 

**Children**  
Our site is a general audience site that is not designed nor intended to collect personal information from children under the age of 13. To respect the privacy of children and to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), children under the age of 13 should not provide any personal information on this site. We ask that parents supervise their children while online. 

**Special Offers**  
Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see choice and opt-out below.

**Site and Service Updates**  
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information:**  
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing [webmaster@segway.com](mailto:%20webmaster@segway.com)

**Choice/Opt-out**  
Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials may opt-out of receiving these communications by emailing us at [unsubscribe@segway.com](mailto:unsubscribe@segway.com). 

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post notice of those changes on our Web site home page for 30 days so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If you have any questions you may email us at [privacy@segway.com](mailto:%20privacy@segway.com).
