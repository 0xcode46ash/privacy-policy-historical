**SEGA OF AMERICA'S ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY**

This website is owned and operated by Sega of America, Inc. Sega of America understands that many visitors to its website are concerned about the information they provide to us, and how we treat that information, especially with respect to their children’s privacy. As a result, Sega has developed this Online Privacy Policy. We may update the Policy from time to time, so please check in occasionally. 

**Our General Policy**  
At our site, we don’t collect personally-identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. This means we don’t require you to register or provide information to us in order to view our site. If you do provide us with information, we will use it internally to better tailor our products and services to our customers’ interests. We may also use it to contact you with information on Sega’s products and services and to inform you of special offers. In addition, it may be provided to other companies which would like to communicate with you about products or services which may be of interest to you. The web page where the information is collected will inform you of the uses, if any, we will make of the information. Your ability to view the site will not in any way be affected if you, your parent or legal guardian decline to grant Sega of America permission to use or share the information for such purposes. 

Our site sometimes includes notices of sweepstakes or other promotions we are conducting, and we may permit you to enter electronically in some cases. If that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose of conducting the promotion (e.g., to contact you if you are a sweepstakes winner) and as otherwise described in the information accompanying the sweepstakes or promotion. 

If you are 12 years of age or younger, you need to obtain permission from your parent or legal guardian before you supply us with your email and/or mailing address or any other personal information. The web page(s) asking for this information will contain instructions on supplying Sega of America with the parental consent you need to obtain. The information supplied by children 12 and under will not be shared, sold or distributed outside of Sega of America, but will be maintained internally by us. 

If you are 13 to 16 years of age you should also obtain permission from your parent or legal guardian before supplying us with an email and/or mailing address and other information. 

If you give Sega of America permission to maintain and use the information you have supplied, and later decide that you do not want to be contacted by Sega of America or by other companies to whom Sega of America may provide your name, you, your parent or legal guardian may contact us at any time at the Internet address below and ask that your information be removed from our list. 

**Cookies**  
Sega currently has multiple pages on its site which allow you to vote for your favorite feature; these pages utilize "cookies". On each of these features there are buttons that enable you to rate each feature from 1-7. When any of these buttons are pressed and you have not previously rated that particular feature, a "cookie" is placed on your machine indicating this. If you have previously rated that particular feature, the "cookie" will indicate this, and your vote will not be registered. You then receive the following message: "SORRY! You’ve already rated this feature. You can rate as many features as you like, but you can only rate each feature once." 

**Links**  
Many websites link to Sega of America’s website and Sega of America may link to the websites of other entities which provide information related to Sega of America’s products and services or which Sega of America considers to be of interest to its website visitors. Sega of America is not able to control what information may be contained on a linked site. If you are 16 years old or younger, you should always check with a parent or legal guardian before linking to any new sites.
