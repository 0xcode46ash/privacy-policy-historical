We will collect the following information about you:

  * If you provide information to us by email or through the SeeSaw website (e.g. if you provide your email address, name, address or other information when you contact us).

### How we use your information

We will use your information to administer the website, respond to and keep track of your enquiries and improve the quality of the website and our services.

You may have rights of access to and correction of any personal data that we hold about you under data protection law. If you wish to exercise those rights or have queries about this privacy policy you can send an email to [_info@seesaw.com_](mailto:info@seesaw.com).

### Site tracking

We use tracking software to monitor customer traffic patterns and website usage to help us develop the design and layout of the website to better meet the needs of visitors to [seesaw.com](http://seesaw.com/) and to enhance your use of the service including, for example, by providing recommendations or other facilities as they become available. This software does not enable us to capture any personal data.

### Disclosure to third parties

We never disclose your personal data to any other person or organisation without your consent unless we have said so in this privacy policy or there is an emergency situation that requires it or we are legally required to do so.

We may pass your personal data on to other companies which are affiliated or associated with SeeSaw IPTV Limited to enable us to process your personal data for the purposes identified in this privacy policy.

We may pass your information on to trustworthy third parties that we use for the provision of certain services such as providing website administration or processing enquiries.

We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-parties, but these statistics will not include any personal data.

We may transfer your personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area which do not have laws or regulations to protect personal data which are equivalent to those in the UK.  When we do so, we will remain in control of the data and it will continue to be protected by appropriate security measures.

### Security to protect your information

As required by the UK Data Protection Act 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us to prevent unauthorised access.
