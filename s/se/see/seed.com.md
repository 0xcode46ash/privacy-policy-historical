 **California Online Privacy Protection Act**

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States of America (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personal information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.

 **In compliance with CalOPPA, we agree to the following:**

  * Users can visit our site anonymously
  * We will maintain a link to our Privacy Policy on our home page
  * Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on our home page
  * You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page



You can change your personal information:

  * By calling 844-646-3586 or emailing care@seed.com

 **COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)**

Our site is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. Seed does not knowingly collect or use any personal information from such children. If you are under the age of 13, do not submit any information through our site. If we learn that we collected personal information from children under the age of 13, we will take steps to promptly delete that information. If you believe that a child under age 13 may have provided us with personal information, please contact us at care@seed.com.

 **CAN-SPAM Act**

The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them. If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at care@seed.com and we will promptly remove you from all correspondence.

 **Global Reach**

Seed is a U.S.-based company that has operations and service providers in the United States and internationally. As a result, personal information that we collect, including personal information, may be transferred to our U.S. offices to permit us to comply with our legal, contractual and business obligations and activities. In addition, we may provide information to third-party service providers in the U.S. and in other countries to the extent necessary to support Seed’s business activities, and we may access personal information collected by our customers to support the services that we provide to our customers. Thus, personal information may be transferred to and stored on servers located in the United States and in countries different from the country in which that information was initially collected. Similarly, information we collect may be accessed by Seed and our third-party service providers and business partners from countries other than the ones in which the information is stored.

 **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** ****

The GDPR is an European Union (EU) regulation to improve the protection of the personal information and data of EU citizens and increase the obligations of entities who collect or process personal data. These new regulations took effect on May 25, 2018. The regulations greatly enhance the data privacy and security of our customers and extend to them exercisable rights enabling greater control over one’s personal information.

Seed functions as both a controller and processor of our customers’ personally identifiable information (PII). Additionally, we employ a number of sub-processors to which we transmit data for storage or processing.

 **Data Retention and Deletion** ****

We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to accomplish the business purpose for which it was collected or to comply with our legal and contractual obligations.  Afterwards, we will securely dispose such personal information, as required by applicable law.

 **Governing Law**

This Privacy Policy shall be interpreted and governed by the laws of the State of California. The courts located in Los Angeles, California, shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear any claims or disputes arising out of this Privacy Policy.
