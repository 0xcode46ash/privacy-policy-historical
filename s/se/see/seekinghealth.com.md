## PRIVACY & SECURITY

This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally identifiable information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.

### How do we protect your information?

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information.

We use regular Malware Scanning.

We protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order.

Transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

### Do we use cookies?

Yes - Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the site or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

We use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart, understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.

If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies via your browser settings.

### If users disable cookies in their browser:

If you disable cookies, some features will be disabled: customer log-in, recently viewed products, order information, add to cart, order placement. It will turn off some of the features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.

However, you can still place orders over the telephone by contacting customer service.

### Do we disclose any information to outside parties?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or providing customer services, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

### Third Party Links

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

### Interest-Based Online Advertising and Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics 3rd-party audience data such as age, gender and interests and AdWords remarketing service to better understand the behavior of our customers and advertise on third party websites (including Google). For example, we may advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site, such as using the contact form or adding to the Shopping Cart. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or on a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies and other automated means to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the Seeking Health website and other demographic information. These companies also use automated technologies to collect information when you click on our ads, which helps track and manage the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy.

You may set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the [Google Ad Preferences page](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/), or you may [opt out of interest-based advertising entirely using cookie settings](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/) or by visiting the [opt-out page for the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). Because these opt-out and preference forms are specific to your individual browser and are not owned/operated by Seeking Health, we are not able to change your settings or perform the opt-outs for you.

### California Online Privacy Protection Act

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. [See more here.](http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf)

### CAN-SPAM Act
