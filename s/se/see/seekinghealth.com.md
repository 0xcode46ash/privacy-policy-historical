Seeking Health respects the privacy of every individual who visits our website or purchases products on-line. This statement of our privacy policy outlines the information Seeking Health will collect and how we will use that information. This policy statement will also instruct you on what to do if you want Seeking Health to remove your personal information collected or stored during previous visits to the Seeking Health website.   
  
Use Of Personal Information  
  
Seeking Health will not collect or retain any information about you personally (that is, your name, address, telephone number, or email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily. If you do not want any personal information collected, please do not submit it to us.

If you have already submitted this information and would like for us to remove it from our records, please contact us at the email address listed at the bottom of this policy statement. We will delete your information from our existing files. If you do provide us with personal information, we may retain and use that information for several purposes. First, we may store and process the information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services. Second, we may retain information about your previous purchases of SeekingHealth products in order to customize our
