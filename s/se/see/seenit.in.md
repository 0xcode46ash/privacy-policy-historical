# Seen It | Privacy

## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. This Statement of Privacy governs data collection and usage and applies to http://www.seenit.in. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to ‘Seen It’ include http://www.seenit.in and SeenIt. By using the Seen It website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Seen It collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Seen It’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Seen It’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Seen It may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Seen It also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Seen It only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Seen It’s websites choose to interact with Seen It in ways that require Seen It to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Seen It gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, Seen It collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Seen It. Seen It does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Aggregated Statistics

Seen It may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Seen It may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Seen It does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Seen It discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Seen It’s behalf or to provide services available at Seen It’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Seen It’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Seen It will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Seen It discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Seen It believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Seen It, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Seen It and have supplied your email address, Seen It may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Seen It and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Seen It takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Business Transfers

If Seen It, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Seen It goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Seen It may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Seen It and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
