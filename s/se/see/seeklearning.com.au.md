  2. **Collecting information on SEEK Learning Australia visitors**  
SEEK Learning Australia collects information on our site visitors collectively including which sections of the site are most frequently visited, how often and for how long.

SEEK Learning Australia utilises this information to improve and enhance our services by monitoring the areas on the site which are most popular to you. This aggregated information may be shared with SEEK Learning Australia partners to provide them with an overview of how SEEK Learning Australia visitors use the site. This is done for the purposes of providing you with the best online career management services.

_IP Addresses_  
SEEK Learning Australia’s web servers gather your IP address to assist with the diagnosis of problems or support issues with our services. Again, information is gathered in aggregate only and cannot be traced to an individual user.

SEEK Learning Australia utilises cookies to provide you with a better user experience. These cookies and applets allow you to utilise specific services such as accessing free demonstration training courses.

Users who do not wish to receive cookies can instruct their web browsers to refuse them. However, doing so will prevent access to some areas of the site and limit your use of some of the SEEK Learning Australia services.

In order to better understand our users, SEEK Learning Australia utilises a third measurement company, Nielsen//NetRatings - [ www.nielsen-netratings.com.au](http://www.nielsen-netratings.com.au/) \- to assess site traffic. A tracking code is used to collect the following information on the usage of the SEEK Learning Australia site: 

    * The number of page views (or page impressions) that occur on SEEK Learning Australia;
    * The number of unique visitors to SEEK Learning Australia;
    * How long these unique visitors (on average) spend on SEEK Learning Australia when they do visit; and
    * Common entry and exit points into SEEK Learning Australia.

This aggregate, non-personal information is collated and provided to SEEK Learning Australia to assist in analysing the usage of the site. This data is also accessible by media organisations and research companies, for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other Internet websites.
