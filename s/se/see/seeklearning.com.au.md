# SEEK Learning - Privacy Statement

  1. **SEEK Learning’s commitment to maintaining your privacy**  
The SEEK Learning Privacy Statement has been created because we value our users and recognise their right to keep personal information private. This statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the SEEK Learning site. 

  2. **Collecting information on SEEK Learning visitors**  
SEEK Learning collects information on our site visitors collectively including which sections of the site are most frequently visited, how often and for how long. This data is always used as aggregated, non-personal information. SEEK Learning utilises this information to improve and enhance our services by monitoring the areas on the site which are most popular to you. This aggregated information may be shared with SEEK Learning partners to provide them with an overview of how SEEK Learning visitors use the site. This is done for the purposes of providing you with the best online career management services. 

_IP Addresses_  
SEEK Learning’s web servers gather your IP address to assist with the diagnosis of problems or support issues with our services. Again, information is gathered in aggregate only and cannot be traced to an individual user.

_Cookies & Applets_  
SEEK Learning utilises cookies to provide you with a better user experience. These cookies and applets allow you to utilise specific services such as accessing free demonstration training courses.

Users who do not wish to receive cookies can instruct their web browsers to refuse them. However, doing so will prevent access to some areas of the site and limit your use of some of the SEEK Learning services.

_Third Party Measurement_  
In order to better understand our users, SEEK Learning utilises a third measurement company, Nielsen//NetRatings - [ www.nielsen-netratings.com.au](http://www.nielsen-netratings.com.au/) \- to assess site traffic. A tracking code is used to collect the following information on the usage of the SEEK Learning site: 

    * The number of page views (or page impressions) that occur on SEEK Learning;
    * The number of unique visitors to SEEK Learning;
    * How long these unique visitors (on average) spend on SEEK Learning when they do visit; and
    * Common entry and exit points into SEEK Learning. 

This aggregate, non-personal information is collated and provided to SEEK Learning to assist in analysing the usage of the site. This data is also accessible by media organisations and research companies, for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other Internet websites.

  3. **Collecting information on SEEK Learning Registered Users**  
As part of registering with SEEK Learning, we collect personal information about you in order for us to contact you to take full advantage of the SEEK Learning offerings. We collect personal information directly from an individual who registers with SEEK Learning and from our recruitment partners (in accordance with their respective Privacy Policies). We also collect information from our distribution partner, Skillsoft.

  4. **Email communications from SEEK Learning**  
SEEK Learning also provides you with selected information about training and related opportunities in email newsletters. This free service is sent to registered users and provides the option of opting out at the point of registration. SEEK Learning may also make you aware of additional products and services which form part of your relationship with SEEK Learning.

  5. **Storage & Security of Personal Information**  
SEEK Learning takes all reasonable steps to ensure the security of our system. Any information which we hold for you is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. 

In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by SEEK Learning. However, SEEK Learning will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access of your personal information.

  7. **Feedback**  
SEEK Learning welcomes ideas and feedback about all aspects of the site. SEEK Learning stores feedback that users send to us. This feedback will be used to administer and refine the service and may be shared with SEEK Learning partners either in aggregate form or with specific identifying characteristics removed.

  8. **Privacy & Site Changes**  
From time to time, SEEK Learning may review and update its privacy statement. Revised versions will be updated on the website.
