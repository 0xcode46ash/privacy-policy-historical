### CMA Registration and Order Forms 

CMA, both on our web site and in paper format, uses registration and order forms for customers to make donations, order retail products, become members, adopt animals, and register for various services. These registration and order forms may require users to give us contact information (such as name, address and e-mail address), and payment information. Contact information from these forms is used to fulfill orders and to send acknowledgments and requested information. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the customer when necessary in order to fulfill a transaction. User payment information is used only for credit card authorization and billing in the process of completing user-initiated transactions.

Contact information will also be added to CMA's mailing and e-mail lists to inform you about upcoming events, current news and other information about Aquarium activities.

Transaction-related contact information will be retained securely per legally required information retention policies in any case.
