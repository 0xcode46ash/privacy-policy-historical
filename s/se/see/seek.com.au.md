# SEEK - Privacy Statement

  | 

  


  1. ## SEEK’s commitment to maintaining your privacy

  
SEEK’s Privacy Statement has been created because we value our users and recognise their right to keep personal information private. This statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for all sites managed by SEEK. 
  2. ## Collecting information on SEEK visitors

  
SEEK collects information on our site visitors collectively including which sections of the site are most frequently visited, how often and for how long. This data is always used as aggregated, non-personal information. SEEK utilises this information to improve and enhance our services by monitoring the areas on the site which are most popular to you. This aggregated information may be shared with SEEK partners to provide them with an overview of how SEEK visitors use the site. This is done for the purposes of providing you with the best online career management services. 

_IP Addresses_  
SEEK’s web servers gather your IP address to assist with the diagnosis of problems or support issues with our services. Again, information is gathered in aggregate only and cannot be traced to an individual user. 

_Cookies & Applets_  
SEEK uses cookies to provide you with a better experience. These cookies and applets allow you to use specific services such as Job Mail (an alert service which emails your chosen jobs), Application Tracker (to manage your SEEK job applications), to remember who you are for Auto Login if you choose this option and to remember your last search criteria for My Last Search. 

Users who do not wish to receive cookies can instruct their web browsers to refuse them. However, doing so will prevent access to some areas of the site and limit your use of some of the SEEK services.

_Third Party Measurement_  
In order to better understand our users, SEEK utilises a third party measurement company, [Nielsen//NetRatings](http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/) to assess site traffic. A tracking code is used to collect the following information on the usage of the SEEK site:

    * The number of page views (or page impressions) that occur on SEEK; 
    * The number of unique visitors to SEEK; 
    * How long these unique visitors (on average) spend on SEEK when they do visit; and 
    * Common entry and exit points into SEEK. 
  
This aggregate, non-personal information is collated and provided to SEEK to assist in analysing the usage of the site. This data is also accessible by media organisations and research companies, for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other Internet websites. 
  3. ## Collecting information on SEEK Registered ‘[My Account](https://web.archive.org/myseek/myaccount.ascx)’ Members 

  
As part of registering with SEEK, we collect personal information about you in order for you to take full advantage of SEEK’s services. To do this it may be necessary for you to provide additional information to SEEK as detailed below.

_Registration_  
Registration is completely optional. However, registration for ‘[My Account](https://web.archive.org/myseek/myaccount.ascx)’ services allows you to take advantage of more of the tools and resources that assist you in finding a job. Registration includes submitting your email address. You may access this information at any time by clicking ‘My Details’ on ‘[My Account](https://web.archive.org/myseek/myaccount.ascx)’, or by clicking here.

_Job Mail_  
Job Mail is an optional service. SEEK requests that you provide information relating to your employment preferences as well as your email address so that we may notify you via email of jobs specific to your needs. Users can modify or delete their Job Mail profiles at any time by going to the ‘[My Account](https://web.archive.org/myseek/myaccount.ascx)’ area of the site.

_Resumes_  
As part of the online job service, SEEK provides registered members with the option of creating a resume to use for application. You may also choose to allow SEEK clients to view your resume. SEEK provides the following privacy options:

_Private SEEK Resumes_  
SEEK provides the option of creating a resume and making it ‘Private’. This means that your resume will not be made generally available to employers and recruiters and will be used for making job applications on SEEK.

All information provided when creating these resumes including name, address, email address, telephone numbers, employment and educational history are used for the purposes of facilitating your job seeking efforts.

Users can modify or delete their resume at any time by going to the ‘[My Account](https://web.archive.org/myseek/myaccount.ascx)’ area of the site.

_Public & Anonymous SEEK Resumes_  
SEEK provides the option of making your online resume ‘Public’ or ‘Anonymous’. Selecting one of these options means your resume will be available for viewing by employers and recruiters who pay to access SEEK’s resume database. Though all efforts are taken so that access is given only to those who have requested it via SEEK, we cannot guarantee that other parties will not without our consent gain access to this database.

SEEK resumes give you the option of also providing sensitive information relating to professional associations and memberships, however it is not mandatory to complete this in order to use SEEK services. By providing these details in your resume, you are consenting to have this information passed onto advertisers via any applications made.

You may change the privacy settings for your resume at any time, as well as being able to delete your resume completely from our database. This is done via your [My Account](https://web.archive.org/myseek/myaccount.ascx) account. 

_Online Applications_  
Making an online application to a job advertisement on SEEK is a free and optional service that does not require registration. Job applications require you to complete mandatory fields (first name, last name, phone and email) so that the advertiser can identify and contact you. Your application, including attachments and cover letters, are forwarded directly on to the third party advertiser. This information may also be disclosed to SEEK’s service providers and contractors from time to time who assist us to deliver our products and services. 

By applying to a position advertised on SEEK you are requesting that SEEK pass the information to the Advertiser as a part of your application. 

Additionally, you have the right to request your personal information direct from Advertisers on SEEK.

  4. ## Collecting Salary Survey information

  
As part of providing an independent salary resource for job seekers, SEEK will encourage the public to participate in The Great Australian Salary Survey. Survey responses will be stored and the aggregated data used for general online searching and reporting purposes only. Individual responses will not be personally identifiable. No contact information will be collected. Salary survey responses will be submitted anonymously.

The only contact information that is collected will be in relation to survey respondents registering for the competition prize draw and/or signing up to be notified when the Salary Reports are available. Providing email address information will not be associated with your survey responses and is completely optional.

  5. ## Email communications from SEEK

  
SEEK also provides you with selected information about job seeking and career-related topics in our email newsletter SEEK News Update. This free service is sent to registered users and provides the option of opting out of receiving these by changing your preferences in ‘My Account’. SEEK may also make you aware of additional products and services which form part of your relationship with SEEK. 
  6. ## Storage & Security of Personal Information

  
SEEK takes all reasonable steps to ensure the security of our system. SEEK allows you to access your information at any time to keep it accurate and up to date. Any information which we hold for you is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. 

In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by SEEK. However, SEEK will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access of your personal information. 

You can also play an important role in keeping your personal information secure, by maintaining the confidentiality of any password and accounts used on the SEEK site. Please [notify us immediately](mailto:userhelp@seek.com.au) if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security.

  7. ## Access to Your Information

  
As indicated in point 2, unless you become a registered ‘[My Account](https://web.archive.org/myseek/myaccount.ascx)’ user, SEEK does not collect information that identifies you personally. If however, you become a SEEK registered user, you are able to change and update your registered profile at any time. Should you require assistance with updating your account or removing your details from the site, this can be requested by [forwarding an email](mailto:userhelp@seek.com.au) . You can also request your personal information directly from Advertisers who you have applied to on the site. 
  8. ## SEEK Partners & Advertisers

  
SEEK provides links and passes online application to third party sites. The use of your information by these third party sites is not within the control of SEEK and we cannot accept responsibility for the conduct of these companies. Advertisers who place job ads on SEEK are asked to comply with Australian federal privacy policy with regard to their own information handling practices. 

You may also directly contact advertisers to request access to any personal information that you have sent as part of an application.

  9. ## Transborder data flows

  
Sometimes, we transfer information to persons outside Australia (e.g. a contractor located in the USA who provides us with services). By giving us your personal information, you consent to such disclosures. In addition, we believe that the recipients of such information are subject to a law, binding scheme or contract which effectively upholds principles for fair handling of the information that are substantially similar to the National Privacy Principles. 
  10. ## Feedback

  
SEEK welcomes ideas and feedback about all aspects of the site. SEEK stores feedback that users send to us. This feedback will be used to administer and refine the service and may be shared with SEEK partners either in aggregate form or with specific identifying characteristics removed. 
  11. ## Privacy & Site Changes

  
From time to time, SEEK may review and update its privacy statement. Revised versions will be updated on the website.
