We may use this Personal Information to personalize and improve Seismic Services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to analyze how users utilize the Seismic Services, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may share certain types of Personal Information with third parties (described in this Section and in Section III below). We collect the following types of information:

    1. ### Information You Provide to Us:

We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us on Seismic Services. For example, we collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, etc. We may collect other Personal Information you provide to us through your use of Seismic Services, such as the information or content you upload, display, manage and/or otherwise use in connection with your creation of pitches through the Software (your “Content”). Our Mobile Application does not track users using Geo-Location. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners.

From time to time, we display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at [support@seismic.com](mailto:support@seismic.com).

Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. You can request the removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, by contacting us at support@seismic.com.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

Seismic also collects information under the direction of its Clients who utilize our Software, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes.

    2. ### Information Collected Automatically:

      * Whenever you interact with Seismic Services , we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer that allow us to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your computer or device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of our Website’s best features.

      * We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

      * We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see section IV below.

      * The use of cookies and web beacons by our third party tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these tracking technologies.

      * When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Website), we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data tells us how often users use parts of the Website, so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible. We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use Seismic services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

    3. ### E-mail and Other Communications:

We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may send you promotional offers on behalf of other businesses, or communicate with you about your use of Seismic Servcies. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make emails more interesting and improve our service. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by sending an email to [support@seismic.com](mailto:support@seismic.com).

  3. ### Will Seismic Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?

We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We share your Personal Information in personally identifiable form with third parties as described below.

    1. ### Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:

In certain situations, businesses we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Website (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.

    2. ### Agents:

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Seismic may transfer personal information collected through its Software to companies that help us provide our service as described above. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients.

    3. ### Business Transfers:

We may choose to buy or sell assets.  In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.  Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

    4. ### Protection of Seismic and Others:

We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Seismic, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
