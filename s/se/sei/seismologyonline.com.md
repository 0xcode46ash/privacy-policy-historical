## Privacy Policy

**General**

Seismology collects personal information when you register an enquiry with Seismology or when you use Seismology products and services or when you visit Seismology website pages.

When you register your details with us we ask for information such as your name, email address, tel. number, company details and industry sector. For certain digital media products and services we might also ask for your address, identification number or business registration number. When you register with Seismology and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. Seismology collects information about your use of web services that we offer.

Seismology automatically receives and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, Seismology cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request. Seismology uses this information for the following general purposes: - to customize the content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal use.

**How long will the Seismology keep my personal information?**

We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant service, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with Seismology or Seismology’ corporate retention schedule (this is a database that defines which documents should be kept and for how long). In the case that you wish to cancel your account services with Seismology, once an account is deleted a red flag goes on the database and, while people cannot use the personal information, it stays on the system for a period of one year for administration purposes before being deleted automatically.

Where you contribute content to Seismology we will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted.  
Information sharing and disclosure

Seismology does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Seismology under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Seismology deliver enhanced services communicate with you about new products or services from Seismology. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 

We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Seismology terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

We transfer information about you if Seismology is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Seismology will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Seismology will on occasion display targeted advertisements based on personal information. Seismology advertisers may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.

Seismology does not provide any personal information to any advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.

**Cookies Policy -Information Seismology collects from you**

a. What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.

Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the websites to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Seismology website features. 

Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

During the course of any visit to the Seismology website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.

b. How does Seismology use cookies?

Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example: if on a previous visit you went to our services pages, we might find this out from your cookie and highlight certain service information on your second and subsequent visits.

Seismology also operates measurement and research trials. We gather information regarding the visitors to Seismology sites on our behalf using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on our website. Seismology uses this type of information to help improve the services we provide to our users. Seismology strictly require that third parties do not use any information for their own business or other purposes. Certain other areas of the Seismology site may use cookies for a specific reason - for example, to help an online element work effectively on your device. If this is the case, the local terms for that area of the website will make this clear and you should refer to those local terms for additional information.

**Will I be contacted for marketing purposes?**

Seismology won't contact you for marketing purposes, or promote new services to you unless you specifically agree to be contacted for these purposes. 

**Changes to Seismology’s Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy may be updated from time to time so you may wish to check it each time you submit personal information through any Seismology website. The date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page.
