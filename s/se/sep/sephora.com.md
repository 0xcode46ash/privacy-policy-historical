**What our Privacy Policy Covers**

This Privacy Policy covers any personal information that Sephora obtains from you when you use services on our site. This policy does not cover the practices of companies that Sephora does not own or control, or the actions of people that Sephora does not employ or manage. 

Our Privacy Policy may change in the future. We invite you to check back periodically to see if we have made any changes. If we make any material changes, we will post a notice on our home page. 

By using this site, you agree to the terms of our policy. For more information about the terms of use for this site, please visit our [legal page](https://web.archive.org/includes/legal_notice.jhtml). 

**What Personal Information is Collected**  
Depending on how you use Sephora, we may ask you to share personal information with us. _Whether you choose to give Sephora information is completely up to you, but keep in mind that if you withhold information, you may not be able to use some of our services._

**When Personal Information is Collected**  
Sephora will ask you for information, including some personal information, if you use one of several services: 

    **Becoming a registered user.** In order to register, you need to share some personal information, such as your name and e-mail address. You do not have to be a registered user to visit Sephora.com's web pages. But, you will have to register if you want to place orders or make full use of our services.
    **Making a purchase.** When you buy something on Sephora.com, you have to supply a billing address, phone number, shipping address, and credit card information. By making a purchase, you become a registered user of Sephora.com. You can choose to store information needed to make a purchase, such as your credit card number, shipping and billing addresses in the My Account - Profile page. If you change your mind about storing this information, you can amend or delete it by going to the relevant area of the My Account-Profile page and following the instructions. You can access this section using your registration password.
    **Sweepstakes, Contests and Surveys.** If you enter a sweepstakes or contest, or answer a survey, you will become a registered user (if you aren't one already). We may also ask you for some demographic information, such as your age. If you choose not to answer, you probably will not be able to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or survey.
    **Gift Advisor and Beauty Advisor.** If you are not already registered and you send an e-mail to our Gift or Beauty Advisor, we will create a registration profile for you. This will make you a registered user. We may also collect information about e-mails that you send to our advisors. We use this information for product and site analysis only.

**How Sephora Protects Your Information**  
We realize that our customers trust us to protect their personal information. We take that task seriously. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. For example: 

We use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") authentication to guarantee the confidentiality of online transactions made on our site. SSL authentication and encryption of the information that you send to us over the Internet help protect your online transaction information from third party interception. 

  * We never display your full credit card number once it has been entered. We will only reveal the last four digits of your credit card for verification purposes.
  * We urge you to protect your own privacy. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone or share your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail.



Unfortunately, despite all of our efforts, there is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions. This reality is true of all Internet use. As a result, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit, and you transmit all information at your own risk. 

**How Sephora Uses Your Personal Information**  
Sephora collects personal information primarily to make our services more rewarding for you to use. We usually use this information for internal purposes, such as studying our customers' preferences. We may also use your information to contact you for account and promotional purposes. 

In the event that another company buys the assets or stock of Sephora.com, your personal information may then belong to another entity. 

**How to Avoid Receiving Newsletters and Other Sephora.com Materials**  
We use e-mail addresses to send out newsletters and other announcements with information about Sephora.com's new products, gifts and special features. When you register, you can choose not to receive these announcements by opting-out of delivery. If you receive an e-mail and want to avoid further messages, look at the end of the e-mail for instructions on how to remove yourself from the mailing list. You can also edit your e-mail preferences at Sephora.com's My Account - Profile. 

**Who Views Your Personal Information**  
Sephora may share your personal information with companies that perform services for us, such as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mails, analyzing customer data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, investigating fraudulent activity, conducting customer surveys, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not disclose your personally identifiable information for other purposes. 

Some personal information is stored on servers owned by other companies. Only Sephora has the right to access this information. 

We currently share aggregate information about our customers with advertisers and marketing partners. This information does not identify individual users. 

Personal information may be disclosed if required by law. 

Sephora does not currently sell or license personal information. Before selling or licensing your personal information, we will post a notice in this Privacy Policy and on our home page. 

At this time, Sephora does not share any personal information with its affiliates. It is possible that this policy will change in the future. If we do decide to share information with our affiliates, we will post a notice in this Privacy Policy and on our home page. 

**Sephora's Use of Web Beacons**  
We have included web beacons on some of our web pages. Sephora uses web beacons to transfer data (such as purchase and site usage history). Sephora may provide this data to companies that assist Sephora in data research and analysis; these companies are prohibited from using this data for any other purpose. The analysis and research helps Sephora to determine customer preferences and improve Sephora's offerings. Sephora may also rely upon third parties to assist with the use and implementation of the web beacons. 

> Definition of web beacon: A _web beacon_ , sometimes called a pixel, is a graphic image or small string of code, that is included on web pages or in an email to enable the transfer of data. Web beacons can be used by companies for several purposes such as reporting web site traffic, customer preferences, advertising effectiveness, and general auditing. 

  
**Making a Purchase**  
When you buy something on Sephora.com, you have to supply a billing address, phone number, shipping address, and credit card information. By making a purchase, you become a registered user of Sephora.com. You can choose to store information needed to make a purchase, such as your credit card number, shipping and billing addresses in the My Account - Profile page. If you change your mind about storing this information, you can amend or delete it by going to the relevant area of the My Account-Profile page and following the instructions. You can access this section using your registration password. 

**Children Under 13**  
You can look at our site, but you cannot make a purchase. You also cannot become a registered user, or use any service that asks for personal information. Our site is not designed for children. We do not wish to collect personal information from children under 13. 

This policy is designed to protect children. Federal law requires us to take special steps to safeguard children's privacy. For more information about this federal law and about children's privacy, [click here](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/kidz.htm). 

If you register with us and we discover that you are under 13, we will delete your registration. We will send you a message if we do this. If you are under 13 and want to make a purchase, please ask a parent to place the order for you. 

**Cookies on Sephora.com**  
We collect some anonymous information about how you use the site by setting and accessing cookies on your computer. These cookies track information such as how often you visit our web site, what pages you view, and where you go after you leave the site. The cookies track your computer, not you. They are not connected to any personal information about you.
