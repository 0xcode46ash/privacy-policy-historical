**Traffic Data**  
To improve the usefulness of our Web site for our visitors, we automatically collect and maintain statistical information from our Web site's data logs that concern network traffic flow and volume ("Traffic Data"). Traffic Data consists of the:

  * Internet Protocol Number; 
  * type of Web browser used; and 
  * date and time this Web site is visited. 



Traffic Data does not identify individual visitors. Traffic Data is, however, helpful in permitting us to improve our Web site and to maintain its accessibility.

**General Visitors**  
For general visitors not using applications requiring an authenticated log-in, SDG&E may use cookies for purposes of gathering Traffic Data. Cookies are files placed on a visitor's hard drive that allow the Web site to monitor the individual's use of the site. No attempts are made to identify individual users unless actions are taken to identify yourself by an “opt in,” for example:

  * inclusion on a SDG&E mailing list is requested; 
  * illegal behavior or unauthorized activities are suspected; or 
  * user identification is required under law. 



SDG&E will not disclose the information you give us with any third party except to the extent such third party requires such information in order to perform services for SDG&E related to SDG&E’s own business purposes, unless required by law, or when necessary to protect the Web site or SDG&E. We will not collect or sell your information for commercial purposes with third parties.

**Monitoring Activities**  
SDG&E monitors network traffic continuously to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage to the Web site or to SDG&E. Monitoring also occurs to prevent any activity that is illegal, or which may subject SDG&E to legal liability or damage. SDG&E is committed to maintain the Web site's security and its ongoing compliance with law so that this service will remain available to all visitors.
