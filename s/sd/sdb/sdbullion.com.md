**Our Privacy Policy explains:**

• What information we collect and why we collect it.  
• How we use that information.  
• The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.

  
**Information we collect**

SD Bullion collects information to tailor your shopping experience to you. From identifying your location and language to identifying product you recently viewed- SD Bullion’s shopping experience is unique to each user.

We collect information in two ways:

1\. Information you provide to us. SD Bullion will require a user to register for an account prior to finalizing a purchase online. We may ask for personal information such as your name, address, and other general contact information. We also may require a credit card number to be stored on a secure third-party merchant gateway in order to insure we receive payment. The information is used to complete shopping transactions, optimize order fulfillment, and protect you from fraudulent activity. As you would expect from The Doc, sensitive information is secured using the latest encryption technology.

2\. Information we gather from your use of our website. SD Bullion collects information using solutions, mainly Google analytics, which stores information by the way of cookies sent to your device.
