# ScienceGeek.net Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy 

**_Google Ads_**
    I use GoogleAds to serve ads when you visit my website. Google may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by Google, [click here.](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 
  
**_Email ListServe_**
    My email lists are set up to allow only the owner (Me) to send out email. Recipients will never see the email address of anyone else on the list. Because you must verify (through an email) your intent to subscribe or unsubscribe, you cannot be subscribed or unsubscribed without your approval. Additionally, your email address will never be sold or shared with others.
  
    The content of the email will be limited to the academic courses that I teach. You will not receive email of a political nature. I will not use the list to forward email from others, and you will never receive advertising through my listserve. 
  
**_The Grade Database_**
    The grade database is only for the use of my students. While I do make the database system available to some of my colleagues, their grades reside in separate directories with separate passwords. While no resource on the Internet can be declared 100% secure, I make every effort to maintain the highest security protocols. 
  
    Parents may request a more secure password. I will only grant the password change to parent because students who request the change often do so in order to make the grade reports inaccessible to their own parents.
  
    The grade database will use a cookie to "time-out" the access period to the grade database. This keeps people who use a public computer from leaving the grade viewable in the computer history file. Accesses to the database are logged by student ID number, date and time, but no IP address is recorded.
