# BayerUS - Privacy Statement

Bayer in the United States

Bayer is aware that the security of your private information from the use of our web-site is an important concern. We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Therefore we would like you to know what data we maintain and what data we discard. With this privacy statement, we would like to inform you about our security measures.

Collection of Data  
You can use our web site without disclosing your personal data. You are not required to provide personal information as a condition of using our site, except as may be necessary to provide you a product or service at your request. When you use our website,  data may be stored for various security purposes. This data may include the name of your internet service provider, the web site that you used to link to our site, the web sites that you visit from our site and your IP-Address. This data could possibly lead to your identification, but we do not use it to do so. We do use the data from time to time for statistical purposes, but maintain the anonymity of each individual user so that the person cannot be identified. In cases when personal data is provided to others to provide you products or services you have requested, or for other purposes you have authorized, we rely on technical and organizational means to assure that applicable data security regulations are followed.

Collection and processing of personal data  
We collect personal data only when you provide it to us, through registration, completion of forms or e-mails, as part of an order for products or services, inquiries or requests about materials being ordered and similar situations in which you have chosen to provide the information to us.

The database and its contents remain at our company and stay with data processors or servers acting on our behalf and responsible to us. Your personal data will not be passed on by us or by our agents for use by third parties in any form whatsoever, unless we have obtained your consent or are legally required to do so.

We will retain control of and responsibility for the use of any personal data you disclose to us. Some of this data may be stored or processed at computers located in other jurisdictions, such as the United States, whose data protection laws may differ from the jurisdiction in which you live. In such cases, we will ensure that appropriate protections are in place to require the data processor in that country to maintain protections on the data that are equivalent to those that apply in the country in which you live.

Safe Harbor Privacy Statement  
Bayer AG and its wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries, including Bayer Business & Technology Services LLC (referred to collectively herein as “Bayer”), are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of those who entrust us with their personal information. Our employees, and all those who do business with us, trust and expect that we will protect their personal information in accordance with the promises we make. In furtherance of our commitment, Bayer has certified to the Safe Harbor Agreement between the United States and the European Union. Accordingly, Bayer adheres to the Safe Harbor privacy principles as agreed to by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission.

Scope  
This Safe Harbor Privacy Statement sets forth how Bayer handles information transferred from countries in the European Union, European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland to the United States on behalf of Bayer. This can include both Personal Information and Sensitive Information collected from employees, partners and customers and transferred via on-line, off-line, written or verbal methods.

About the Safe Harbor   
The Safe Harbor program was jointly established in June 2000 by the United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission, as a method for transferring personal information from the European Union (EU), to companies in the United States. The program is a voluntary self-certification process for companies operating in the United States. Companies that certify represent that they are upholding privacy standards for personal information received from the EU that have been jointly accepted by the European Commission and the US Department of Commerce. These standards exceed current US privacy standards.  
"Personal Information" means information that can directly or indirectly lead to the identification of a living person, such as an individual's name, address, e-mail, telephone number, license number, medical identification number, photograph, or other identifying characteristic. The identification can occur by reference to one or more factors specific to the individual's physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. Personal information does not include information that has been anonymized, encoded or otherwise stripped of its identifiers, or information that is publicly available, unless combined with other non-public personal information.   
“Sensitive Information” means Personal Information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual.

Notice   
Bayer will inform individuals about the purposes for which we collect and use Personal Information about them, how to contact us, the types of third parties with whom we may share Personal Information (if applicable), and any ways that individuals may limit the use and sharing of such information. This notice will be provided when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information or as soon thereafter as is practicable.

Choice   
Bayer will offer an individual the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether personal information is (a) shared with a non-agent third party or (b) used for a purpose that is incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

For Sensitive Information, Bayer will give an individual an affirmative or explicit (opt in) choice if the information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than those for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

Onward Transfer   
Bayer will only transfer Personal Information to a third party consistent with the notice and choice principles stated above. If Bayer discloses Personal Information to a third party, Bayer will either: (i) ensure that the third party is subject to the safe harbor principles; or (ii) require the third party by contract to provide the same level of protection as required by the safe harbor principles.

Security   
Bayer will take reasonable precautions to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. The principle of security applies to how Bayer stores, processes, maintains and protects personal information.

Data Integrity   
Bayer will only use and share Personal Information about individuals in a way that is consistent with the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized by those individuals. To the extent necessary for those purposes, Bayer will take reasonable steps to ensure that the information is accurate, complete, and current.

Access   
Bayer will provide individuals with reasonable access to Personal Information about them and they may request the correction or amendment of Personal Information that they demonstrate to be incorrect or incomplete.

Enforcement   
Bayer has put in place mechanisms to verify our ongoing adherence to these privacy principles. We encourage individuals covered by this statement to raise any concerns that they have about the way we process their Personal Information by contacting us at address below, and we will do our best to resolve them. We have also agreed to participate in the independent dispute resolution program provided by the European Data Protection Authorities Panel.

Limitation on Scope of Principles Adherence by Bayer to these privacy principles may be limited to the extent required to meet a legal, governmental, national security or public interest obligation.
