Bayer is aware that the security of your private information from the use of our websites, mobile apps or other online services (“Website”) is an important concern. We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Therefore we would like you to know what data we maintain and what data we discard. With this privacy statement, we would like to inform you about our security measures.

## Collection of Data

You can use many features of our Website without disclosing your personal data. You are not required to provide personal information as a condition of using our Website, except as may be necessary to provide you a product or service at your request; these products or services may include some of our apps or online services, such as those providing premium content or exclusive offers. When you use our Website, certain data may be stored for various purposes, including security, site functionality, analytics and marketing purposes. This data may include the name of your internet service provider, the website that you used to link to our Website, the websites that you visit from our Website and your IP-Address or device identifier. This data could possibly lead to your identification, but we do not use it to do so or combine it with personal information without your consent. We do use the data from time to time for statistical purposes, but maintain the anonymity of each individual user so that the person cannot be identified. If you elect to participate in certain analytics, communications and marketing programs, we may also enhance or merge personal data with technical and cookie data we collect or possibly merge data from third parties; we would use this enhanced or merged data to create a more complete profile for a more customized user experience. In cases when personal data is provided to others to provide you products or services you have requested, or for other purposes you have authorized, we rely on technical and organizational means to assure that applicable data security regulations are followed.

## Collection and processing of personal data

We collect personal data only when you provide it to us, through registration, completion of forms or e-mails, as part of an order for products or services, inquiries or requests about materials being ordered and similar situations in which you have chosen to provide the information to us.

The personal data you disclose to us remains at our company and/or with data processors or servers acting on our behalf and responsible to us. We may disclose the personal data we collect to third party service providers in connection with services that they perform for us, such as running and fulfilling promotions, conducting surveys, and e-mail and direct mail delivery services. Your personal data will not otherwise be passed on by us or by our agents for use by third parties in any form whatsoever, unless we have obtained your consent, are legally required to do so such as to comply with law or a legal request such as a subpoena, to protect the company’s rights, property or interests, or in the event of a sale of assets or other corporate restructuring.

We will retain control of and responsibility for the use of any personal data you disclose to us. Some of this data may be stored or processed at computers located in other jurisdictions, such as the United States or another country whose data protection laws may differ from the jurisdiction in which you live. In such cases, we will ensure that appropriate protections are in place to require the data processor in that country to maintain protections on the data that are equivalent to those that apply in the country in which you live.

## Purposes of Use

The personal data we collect will only be used for the purpose of supplying you with the requested products or services or for other purposes for which you have given your consent, except where otherwise provided by law.

## Right of Access and Correction

## Right of Cancellation

Using such cookies it is possible to recognize the visitor's browser in order to optimize the website and simplify its use.

Aside from the technical and aggregate information described above, Bayer does not collect personal data about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party sites or online services without your consent, nor does it permit third parties to do so for their own purposes when you visit our Website. Because an industry-standard Do-Not-Track protocol is not yet established, Bayer’s information collection and disclosure practices and the choices it offers to consumers will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy regardless of a “do not track” choice made by the consumer.
