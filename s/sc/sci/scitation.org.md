Effective Date: October 24, 2017

This Privacy Policy describes how AIP Publishing LLC (“ **AIP Publishing** ” or “ **we** ” or “ **us** ”) collects, uses, and discloses the information that we obtain through our Scitation website ([www.scitation.org](http://www.scitation.org/)), eSpectra website ([https://espectra.aip.org](https://espectra.aip.org/)), Peer X-Press websites, and across the other online sites owned or operated by AIP Publishing that also link to this policy (the “ **Sites** ”). Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through third-party websites or services that you may access through the Sites.

Please review this Privacy Policy carefully. When you submit information to or through the Sites, you consent to the collection and processing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Unless otherwise stated herein, this Privacy Policy is made part of our [Terms of Use](http://www.scitation.org/terms). We encourage you to review our Terms of Use, which contains important information about our liability to you when you use the Sites.

If you do not agree with any part of this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use or, in the case of eSpectra, the User Agreement, then please do not use our Sites.

**Website-Specific Terms**

**eSpectra:** If you use the eSpectra website, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, which is made part of the eSpectra User Agreement. If you have not done so already, please review our eSpectra User Agreement, which contains provisions specific to the eSpectra service. This Privacy Policy is expressly incorporated into the eSpectra User Agreement.

**Peer X-Press** : Peer X-Press (“PXP”) is AIP Publishing’s manuscript submission and peer review system. If you have registered for a PXP account, you will be asked to provide Personal Information such as your name, ORCID ID, email address, institutional affiliation, and country of residence. The primary purpose of gathering this information is to allow us to link a name and contact information to a user ID. The Personal Information that you provide to us via the PXP site, regardless of which journal you register with, is maintained in the Peer X-Press database. A single account enables you to submit or review a manuscript for any AIP Publishing journal. It also allows for information to be shared by the editorial offices in order to facilitate efficient transfers of manuscripts. Member Society PXP account information, however, is maintained in separate databases and is not shared outside of the individual society. If you are invited to review a manuscript, please be aware that although a reviewer's identity is never revealed to the author of the work itself, the report you provide, as well as your Personal Information, will be known to the editor and staff of any journal that considers the manuscript for publication. The same will hold true for an account that is created on your behalf when you are listed as a co-author for a manuscript submitted to an AIP Publishing or Member Society journal.

**Other Sites:** By using the Sites (other than eSpectra or PXP), you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Use](http://www.scitation.org/terms). If you have not done so already, please review our Terms of Use, which contain provisions that limit our liability to you. This Privacy Policy is expressly incorporated into our Terms of Use. Any specific privacy considerations in addition to this general policy will be noted where applicable.

**Information we collect**

When you use our Sites, we may collect Personal Information that helps us identify you as an individual, as well as Personal Information about your use of the Sites. The information that we collect and how we use it depends on how you use and access the Sites.

**_Personal Information_**

When using our Sites, we may collect personal information directly from you. “ **Personal Information** ” is any information that identifies an individual or relates to an identified individual, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, or society membership details. We collect your Personal Information when you, for example, set up an account, register for a service, subscription or alert, obtain access to certain content, sign up for a newsletter, submit a Comment or post on a blog or public message board, make a purchase, or send an inquiry to our customer service team.

We may also collect your Personal Information from other organizations or individuals. For example, if you have registered with one of the Affiliated or Member Societies of the American Institute of Physics, and access to our Sites is part of that registration, we will receive your Personal Information from that Member Society to set up your account and provide you with access. If you are provided with a subscription to our Sites through your employer or organization, we may collect your Personal Information to set up your subscription. In addition, we may collect your Personal Information from other individuals when, for example, an author suggests you as a reviewer for his or her paper or invites you to register for one of our Sites. In these cases, we will send you an email to notify you that you have been suggested as a reviewer and/or instructions for how to register for our Sites.

We may provide an opportunity for you to share information with third-party social media services, such as by associating your social media account with our Sites. When you do so, these social media sites may give us access to certain Personal Information that they store. When you associate your social media account with our Sites, you agree that we may collect, use and store the information provided by that social media service as described in this Privacy Policy. When you visit our branded-social media pages, such as, on Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook, we may collect the Personal Information you provide on those pages and treat that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

When you visit one of our Sites, Personal Information is automatically collected. For example, we use Google Analytics, which is a form of web measurement technology, to automatically track your interaction with our Sites and obtain insight into our website traffic and the effectiveness of our marketing. The types of Personal Information collected automatically may include but are not limited to your internet domain and IP address, the URL address of the previous website you visited, the URL addresses of the webpages that you visited on our Sites, your browser and operating system type, whether you completed certain tasks or were successful in your online requests while on the Sites, or the date and time of your visit.

We may store and share this Personal Information among one or more of our internal databases and create an archival copy for recordkeeping and internal purposes. We also may enhance the data we collect with other information from third-party sources.

**The purpose in collecting Personal Information**

We primarily use the Personal Information we collect in an effort to improve your experience on the Sites, to provide you with services and Content, and to communicate with you about information that you request. We may also use your Personal Information to help us do the following:

  * To operate, improve and personalize the products and services we offer, and provide you with a more consistent and personalized experience when interacting with us.
  * To enable customer service, security, enforce our Terms of Service, and to detect fraud or illegal activities.
  * To create account efficiencies, such as a single customer record, and to eliminate redundancies and duplication.
  * To communicate with you, such as to relay important administrative and transactional announcements about the Sites or your account.
  * To conduct surveys and questionnaires about our Sites and the services we offer.
  * To improve the overall efficiency, security, and functionality of the site to make your visit more productive.
  * To provide you with editorial, marketing, and advertising that we think are relevant to your areas of interest, including materials from our third-party business partners.
  * To conduct research and analysis.
  * To analyze and report on website usage.



**How Personal Information** **is shared**

We may share your Personal Information for the reason(s) disclosed to you at the time that we collect your Personal Information and in the following ways:

  * _At your direction:_ We will share your Personal Information with third parties when you tell us to. For example, if you fill out a form provided by one of our third-party sponsors or advertisers, we will provide that information to them for their own use.
  * _With related entities_ : We may disclose Personal Information to the American Institute of Physics (AIP Publishing’s parent), Affiliated or Member Societies of the American Institute of Physics, and subsidiaries or related companies owned by AIP Publishing.
  * _With our service providers:_ We share your information with our service providers that perform and offer services on our behalf. This allows us to enable specific services and functionality for which we have contracted or partnered, such as customizing our products or services, sending marketing and communications related to our business, payment processing, and improving our Sites. AIP Publishing is responsible for subsequent transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf.
  * _For legal purposes:_ We may disclose your Personal Information to government authorities or third parties, as needed within our reasonable judgment, to identify fraud, to protect and enforce our rights or the rights of our customers or related entities, in response to a subpoena, regulation or other legal process, and when required by law.
  * _During corporate changes:_ We may transfer your Personal Information in the event of a merger, sale, acquisition or other change of ownership or control of our company (whether in whole or in part).



**Cookies and other data collection technologies**

AIP Publishing uses cookies, which are files that are placed on your computer when you first visit a webpage. Cookies allow you to move through the Site more smoothly and enhance your user experience by making it more seamless. They also allow us to record information when you revisit our Sites, retain your customized preferences, and deliver advertisements to you that are tailored to your interests.

AIP Publishing also uses the following types of data collection technologies:

  * _Session cookies:_ Session cookies are designed so that once you close your browser, the cookie will simply terminate. They help you navigate the Site by acting like placeholders or bookmarks to temporarily store information. Session cookies assist you in performing functions such as filling your shopping cart.
  * _Persistent cookies:_ Persistent cookies are permanent and remain on your computer after you terminate your session. Your ability to customize settings based on your own preferences is dependent on persistent cookies. Each time you return to our Site, for example, persistent cookies allow us to identify you as a returning user, so that you don’t have to re-enter information that you’ve already provided.
  * _Third-party cookies:_ AIP Publishing uses third-party cookies to enable our trusted partners to bring increased functionality to our Site. For example, AIP Publishing has partnered with a service that allows for the collection of usage data for our own marketing purposes. The information we obtain may be used to offer you assistance, to help us make improvements to the website, or to send you special offers that relate to the content you’ve viewed.
  * _Web beacons:_ Web beacons, or single pixel gifs, are a form of tracking technology that record user behavior. We use web beacons on our Site and in emails we may send to you to collect information such as whether you opened a web page or email, your IP address, the type of browser you used, etc. This information allows us to measure the effectiveness of our campaigns, to target specific content only to those who are most interested, and to improve our features and your overall user experience.
  * _Do Not Track:_ Some web browsers incorporate a Do Not Track (“ **DNT** ”) or similar feature that signals to digital services that a user does not want to have his/her online activity tracked. If a digital service that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that digital service from collecting certain information about that browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, we and many other digital service operators do not respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit [http://allaboutdnt.com](http://allaboutdnt.com/).  



**Online advertising**

We may contract with third-party remarketing services, such as Google AdWords, to tailor advertising to our users. Through the use of cookies, Google Adwords tracks what parts of our Site you visited in order to serve you relevant ads on other websites you visit as you navigate across the Internet. This ensures you only receive content that is of interest to you. Please understand that if you disable cookies (as discussed below) to prevent such interest-based advertising, you may still see advertisements – they just will not be tailored to your interests.

**Your online choices**

You can control what types of cookies you wish to allow, delete, or disable through the settings in your browser. If you restrict cookies, however, you may not obtain the optimum benefit of the Sites’ functionality or be able to access all of its content.

  * If you would like to opt out of participating in Google AdWords Remarketing, please visit [Google’s Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous?sig=ACi0TCgggXMw1Cge50MmsKFyvvxUC4LNaXM3SkMr6MXe4VLgk-pQKsT1mecb5JvX04BLkiDfuJWpqGS6fgGAf5P3dg6o2BZAo3kH1Uo-AHbAI66fYo3ST0U&hl=en).
  * To prevent information from being collected by Google Analytics, you can install the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
  * To opt out of any third-party vendor's use of cookies, please visit [networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).
  * More information about the nature of cookies and how they work may also be found at [allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).



**Your access and opt-out rights**

AIP Publishing strives to make sure that our information is reliable, accurate, and up-to-date. While Personal Information is maintained by AIP Publishing, you may access the Personal Information that we have collected directly from you to the extent required by law to review, update, and correct inaccuracies. You can also visit your account to manage and correct the Personal Information we have on file for you. Upon request made to the contact listed below under the section titled “Contact information,” we will provide You with reasonable access to the Personal Information we have collected from You. If you contact us directly we will take reasonable steps to confirm your identity before making any changes. Because Personal information—for example, your email address—is required to use the Site, we retain certain Personal Information as long as your account is active. You will have the opportunity to correct, transfer, update, modify, or delete this information by logging into Your account and updating Your Personal Information online. Please note that some information may remain in our records even after You request deletion of Your Personal Information, to the extent permitted by applicable laws. Additionally, there may be limits to the amount of information we can practically provide. For example, we may limit access to Personal Information where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to an individual's privacy or where doing so would violate others' rights. 

If you wish to opt-out of having your Personal Information used for advertising or marketing purposes, or to remove your information from any list that might be sold or given to another organization, please send a request to [help@scitation.org](mailto:help@scitation.org).

Please note that unsubscribing from marketing communications shall not limit our ability to send transactional communications to you regarding products or services you have requested.
