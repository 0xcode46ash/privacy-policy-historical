Our customers' privacy is very important to us here at Edmund Scientific. That is why we are offering this page of information describing what information we collect when you come onto our site. 

Our postal address is:   
101 East Gloucester Pike   
Barrington, NJ 08007 

We can be reached via e-mail at:   
    [scientifics@edsci.com](mailto:scientifics@edsci.com) for **Consumer Science Division** questions.  
    [industrialoptics@edsci.com](mailto:industrialoptics@edsci.com) for **Industrial Optics Division** questions.

The information that we collect on-line is used to improve the content of our website, used to notify consumers about updates to our website, and is used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes. We currently collect the domain name of visitors to our website, e-mail addresses of customers who offer it, aggregate information on what pages consumers access, and information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and catalog requests. 

If you supply us with your postal address you may receive periodic catalog mailings from us with information on new products, services, or upcoming events. Persons who supply us with telephone numbers on-line may receive telephone calls from us with information regarding orders they have placed on-line or via printed catalog. 

From time to time we make a portion of our catalog mailing list available to carefully screened companies whose products or services we believe you might find interesting. As a rule we protect our customer list very closely to insure that it is used only in a manner that serves our customers' interests. Additionally, we will never make your e-mail address available to other companies. 

If you prefer that we do not make your name and address available for these carefully screened offers, or if at any time you want to stop receiving our catalog, or if you don't want to be contacted via e-mail, please check and fill in the appropriate boxes below and submit this form. If you would rather print this form and mail it to us, you may send this form to:
