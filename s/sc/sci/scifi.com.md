SCIFI.COM gathers data about users from different sources. First, through optional, voluntary registration; second, through optional, voluntary participation in certain contests and sweepstakes; and third, through merchandise purchase transactions where delivery to home addresses is required. In addition, users are aggregated for tracking information derived by tallying page views throughout our site, tracking cookies, logging IP addresses, and browser type. Such information enables us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers better understand the demographics of our audience. Because SCIFI.COM derives its revenue mainly from advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users.

SCIFI.COM gathers user information in the following processes:

    1. A user may expressly choose to receive additional information from the contest sponsor, in which case the user's personally identifiable information is divulged to the advertiser.
