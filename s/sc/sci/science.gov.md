This Web site is part of a Federal computer system used to accomplish Federal functions. Computer software programs as well as other surveillance methods are used to monitor network traffic on this Web site for security purposes. By accessing this Web site, you are expressly consenting to these monitoring activities. 

Unauthorized attempts to defeat or circumvent security features; to use the system for other than intended purposes; to deny service to authorized users; to access, obtain, alter, damage, or destroy information; or to otherwise interfere with the system or its operation are strictly prohibited. Evidence of such acts may be disclosed to law enforcement authorities and may result in criminal prosecution under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996, as codified at Section 1030 of Title 18 of the United States Code, or other applicable criminal laws. 

### Privacy

Pursuant to Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002, this site maintains no information in identifiable form on individual members of the public or personal information about employees. (See [Preliminary Privacy Impact Assessment](http://www.osti.gov/privacyimpactassessment.html).) Certain site-access information is automatically captured and stored, including:

    * The date and time you access our site; 
    * Pages accessed (recorded by the text and graphics files that compose that page); and 
    * Referring Web site (if you linked to this site from another Web site). 

We collect no personal information about you other than the above, or unless otherwise stated, or unless you choose to provide this information to us. Site-access information is aggregated and used to assess the value of the Web site in accomplishing its stated information dissemination goals, to plan for enhancements to make this site more useful to visitors, to optimize the site's technical design specifications, and/or to identify system performance or problem areas. This information is used only as a source of anonymous statistical data, and is shared only when required by law enforcement investigation.

  * **Personal Information**

You may choose to provide us with personal information by filling out a form or sending an e-mail message containing specific comments and/or questions. This information is used to respond to your request or to forward your request to the appropriate party who can best answer your question. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, these e-mails and addresses are shared only to the extent necessary to assure that an accurate and timely response is provided. This Web site does not collect information for commercial marketing purposes. 

  * **Use of Computer Cookies**

Cookies are used in accordance with OMB guidelines. Session cookies may be used to provide salient session-related information and to allow product-specific functions to be performed; but, in no instance will cookies be used to capture information that might compromise or threaten personal privacy. 

Beginning on September 2, 2005, Science.gov will be running a six-month customer satisfaction survey that will employ persistent cookies. Participation in this data collection effort is completely voluntary, and failure to respond will in no way affect the visitor's ability to access information. This information will be used by Science.gov solely for the purpose of improving our public Web sites. Persistent cookies will block the repeated delivery of the survey in current and subsequent visits to the site, until their expiration in 30-90 days after being set. These cookies will not collect any information about the visitor, but will only record that the visitor had the opportunity to answer the survey questions. The cookies will not track web surfing activities, nor link any visitor to a particular survey response. 




### Accessibility

  * **Persons with Disabilities**

This Web site has been tested for compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, which requires that Federal agencies' electronic and information technology be made accessible to people with disabilities, including Federal employees as well as members of the public. The Bobby evaluation utility, maintained by Watchfire Corporation as a means of evaluating Web sites in terms of accessibility, is used to facilitate compliance. No accessibility warranty or guarantee is made for sites to which this Web site links; such compliance is beyond our scope or control. 

  * **PDF or Other Image-Based Documents**

This site may contain PDF documents, which require special compliance adaptability tools. In those cases, efforts will be made to provide conversion utilities that will allow access to persons with disabilities; however, no guarantee can be made that all PDF documents will be accessible.
