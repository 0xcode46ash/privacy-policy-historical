Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy covers Sciweavers' treatment of personal information that Sciweavers gathers when you are on the Sciweavers website and when you use Sciweavers services.

Information Collected by Sciweavers

We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website, which is to enable users to discover and share information with one another. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with this objective. We collect the following types of information from our Sciweavers users:

** Information You Provide to Us  
**We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.

        _ Registration_ In order for you to use Sciweavers services, such as sharing new academic links to the website, you must complete a registration form. As part of this registration form, we require you to provide us with e-mail address and your title.

        _ User Profile_ To allow you to express yourself beyond just the information collected during registration, we enable you to provide additional information, such as a short biography, your website URL, affiliation, and position. In addition, you may choose to include a photo of yourself in your profile.

** Automatic Information**

        We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Sciweavers automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on their servers from your browser including your IP address, Sciweavers cookie information, and the page you requested. Sciweavers uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.

        Sciweavers may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. This includes User Profile pages.

E-mail Communications

Sciweavers is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide your email address to a third party. Sciweavers may send out e-mails with Sciweavers-related news. You may also receive notification e-mails from Sciweavers, which inform you of new page contents or comments you already subscribed on. If you do not want to receive notification e-mail from us, please unsubscribe whatever service from your profile page. However, please note that in all cases you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices from us.

Cookies

        Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Sciweavers cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.

        The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of Sciweavers' coolest features.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

Sciweavers may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its sole discretion. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Sciweavers website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if any, it is disclosed.

Effective Date of this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of November 1, 2008.
