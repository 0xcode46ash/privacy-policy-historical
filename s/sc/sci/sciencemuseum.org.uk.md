### 

Cookies are pieces of data that a website can transfer to a user’s web browser. The cookies may remain on your computer after you leave the website but you can manually delete them using most browsers. Most web browsers are pre-set to accept cookies. Some cookies store data just for the time you are on the website. These are called session cookies and are not stored on your computer after you have left the website.

If you prefer not to receive cookies, you can adjust your web browser to refuse cookies or to warn you when cookies are being used. Most elements of the Science Museum Group’s Websites will still function if you disable cookies in your web browser settings.

When you visit Science Museum Group Websites, if your browser is using the standard settings and it is accepting cookies, you are giving consent for cookies on the Science Museum Group Websites to be stored on your computer. If you do not wish for this to happen, you can disable them in the settings of your browser. For more information on cookies and their uses, visit the cookies page on the [Information Commissioner’s Office website](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/).

### 

We use Google Analytics to collect information about how our visitors use and navigate our Websites. We use this information to report to our funders such as the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and to analyse usage of the Websites so that we can continually work to add new features and improve your experience of them. This information is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you personally. Please read the [Google Analytics Privacy Policy](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en) to find out more.

### 

We may use the Advertising Features of Google Analytics to find out more about the demographics and interests of our visitors. When you visit the Websites and see an advertisement (an ‘impression’), a cookie is placed on your computer or device by, for example DoubleClick (Google’s Internet ad serving business) and then if you visit another site that has ads served by DoubleClick, the same cookie can be read and modified by DoubleClick.

By tracking what kind of sites you visit and how you interact with ads for different products and services, Google aims to build up a picture of who you are; your age, gender and interests. Using the Advertising Features of Google Analytics means we receive reports that tell us who Google thinks is visiting our site; age, gender and interests. The information is totally anonymous and you are not personally identifiable.

### 

You can go to [Google preferences](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences) to see what Google thinks are your age, gender and interests. You can add, edit or delete information on that page, or you can opt-out of Google collecting and analysing your behaviour altogether.

Google Analytics collects information anonymously, however you can opt-out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you use by installing the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

### 

Science Museum Group Websites have a number of interactive features on older parts of the Websites that use Flash. Flash is used to deliver games, video and other interactive content. Many web browsers will have a version of the Flash Player that plays these files. The Flash Player can store data in a similar way to standard cookies, using a data file called a Local Shared Object or “Flash cookie”. For more information, visit the Adobe website’s page on managing or disabling Local Shared Objects.

### 

During your visits to the Websites you may be delivered cookies by third-party websites. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, Facebook, SoundCloud, Vimeo, Twitter, YouTube, Google Maps or Flickr, you may be presented with cookies from these websites. The Science Museum Group does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the third-party websites for more information.

### 

From time to time, we run surveys and other analytics tools to improve our Websites. Cookies are used to allow the form or pop-up survey to be hidden on your return visits. This is to prevent you from being shown the survey again unnecessarily. Cookies are also used to record the overall number of answers to the survey questions and to link these to web statistics.

### 

The Websites may contain links to other websites that are outside our control and are not covered by this privacy policy. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you that will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours.

### 

From time to time the Science Museum Group may change this privacy policy. You should therefore check this page each time you submit personal information to the Science Museum Group. The latest privacy policy will always appear on this page.
