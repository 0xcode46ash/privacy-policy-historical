# Privacy Policy | ServerCentral

### Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used. Your personal information will be used only in ways that are compatible with the Privacy Policy. The following policies are only in effect for the Web pages, newsletters, and opt-in announcement lists owned and operated by ServerCentral, ("ServerCentral"). (ServerCentral includes all Web sites and certain other Internet media properties hyper linked from the ServerCentral corporate Web site.) The following information discloses our Privacy Policy.

**What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?**

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, which serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" or IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the ServerCentral, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site.

Our Web servers also collect information about the type of Internet browser you are using, operating system, as well as which of ServerCentral's Web pages you have accessed. This information is used to help our team develop Web sites to display properly for the majority of our visitors. Our Web servers do not automatically record e-mail addresses of its visitors.

**Does ServerCentral use cookies?**

Yes, ServerCentral uses cookies. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are often used to provide you with a customized experience. At no time is any personal information stored within one of our cookies.Accepting cookies through your browser is a personal choice. You can still enjoy ServerCentral's Web sites if you choose not to accept cookies.

**What information do you collect when I complete the "Contact Us" form?**

Any information supplied through our contact forms is used to aid our business to respond to your request and provide you with the necessary information. Your email address may be entered to receive ServerCentral's electronic newsletter. You can unsubscribe to this newsletter at any time.

**Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?**

ServerCentral will not sell or otherwise provide the information we collect to outside third parties for the purpose of direct or indirect mass email marketing. ServerCentral will disclose personal information and/or an IP address when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:

  1. Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities and conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on ServerCentral;
  2. Protect and defend the rights or property of ServerCentral sites and related properties, or visitors to the ServerCentral sites and related properties; and
  3. Identify persons who may be violating the law, the rights of third parties, or otherwise misusing the ServerCentral Network or its related properties.



**What safeguards are in place?**

ServerCentral is obligated to protect your personal information by making reasonable security arrangements against such risks as unauthorized access, use, collection, disclosure or disposal. Security measures have been integrated into the design, implementation and day-to-day operating practices as part of ServerCentral's commitment to protect the personal information it holds.

**What else should I know about my privacy when online?**

ServerCentral site contains many hyperlinks to third party Web sites. ServerCentral is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party Web sites or advertisers. ServerCentral does not share any of the individual personal information you provide ServerCentral with the third parties to which ServerCentral links. Please check with those Web sites to determine their privacy policy. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example, through e-mail or discussion lists, that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from third parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.

**How does ServerCentral handle requests to view or remove Personally Identifiable Information?**

ServerCentral defines "Personally Identifiable Information" ("PII") as information that identifies, or can identify you as an individual, such as a residential address, telephone number, or billing information, and defines "Non-Personally Identifiable Information" ("Non-PII") as aggregated information, demographic data, IP addresses, and other information that does not reveal your specific identity.

When you visit and interact with this web site, ServerCentral and third parties with whom ServerCentral contracts to provide services to ServerCentral, may collect Non-PII (for example, a catalog of the web site pages you visit). Non-PII is anonymous and does not identify you personally.

If you have completed our "Contact Us" form and would like to ask ServerCentral to stop using PII provided at that time, we will honor your request while retaining any record of your PII necessary to comply with applicable federal, state or local law. Â 

ServerCentral customers may review the PII we maintain about them in our records. We will take reasonable steps to correct any PII a customer informs us is incorrect. If you are a customer, you can view and change your registration PII, customer preferences, and profile information by emailing our finance department at [ar@servercentral.com](mailto:ar@servercentral.com), or by logging into our customer portal.

If you would like to communicate with us about this Privacy Policy or ServerCentral's collection and use of your PII, please use the Contact Us form on our web site.

**Consent to this agreement**

By using the ServerCentral site, you consent to the use of information by ServerCentral as specified above. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances it is disclosed.
