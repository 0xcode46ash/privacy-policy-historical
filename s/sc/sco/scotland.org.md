# Privacy statement | The Official Gateway to Scotland

This page explains how scotland.org, which is managed by the Scottish Government, uses any information you give to us, and the ways in which we protect your privacy.

## The Data Protection Act

Under the [Data Protection Act 1998](http://www.dataprotection.gov.uk/), we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. We use leading technologies to safeguard your data, and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it. We do not pass on your details to any third party or government department unless you give us permission to do so.

## What information do we collect?

We collect two kinds of information from visitors to scotland.org: subscribe to scotland.org for updates, and site usage information, from session cookies and log files.

## Subscribe to updates

You can subscribe to updates to the scotland.org website. The information you supply will be stored on backup tapes to avoid loss of data, but will only be used for notifying you periodically of updates to the website. This information will be held for the lifetime of the website, or until you decide to unsubscribe and will not be shared with any other party.

## Site usage information

### Log files

Log files allow us to record visitors' use of the site. Ednet puts together log file information from all our visitors, which we use to inform changes to the layout of the site and to the information in it, based on the way that visitors move around it. Log files do not contain any personal information.

### External links

The Scottish Government is not responsible for the content of external internet sites linked to from scotland.org.

### Changes to this privacy policy

If this privacy policy changes in any way, we will place an updated version on this page. Regularly reviewing this page ensures you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we will share it with other parties.
