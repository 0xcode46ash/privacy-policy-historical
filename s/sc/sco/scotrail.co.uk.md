# Privacy policy - ScotRail

Privacy refers to information we obtain about you and the use we make of it in the course of our business. We also have a Security Statement that describes how sensitive information is kept safe and secure.

If you don't find your concern addressed here, feel free to contact us by e-mail us using the feedback form on this site.

## When I Visit Your Website, What Information Do You Gather About Me?

One of the basic principles we've followed in designing this website is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you've requested. As a result, the answer to this question depends almost entirely on how you choose to make use of our websites and the growing list of website services.

Currently website customers provide information in order to take advantage of the following services:

Purchases: Name, address, phone, e-mail, photo ID card and credit card information are necessary for purchase and delivery. Please note that credit card information is not stored beyond the period of transaction.

Promotional Offers: To supply this to you we need contact details. To make purchases we need the information identified above.Our licence requires us to maintain a record of all season ticket holders.

NB No other organisation is given access to your information.
