## What are cookies?

A cookie is a data file that certain web sites write to your computer's hard drive when you visit such sites. Our website uses cookies to log search types and frequency. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to safeguard our information from illegal theft and data mining. We use this data on an anonymous basis and we do not correlate this information with personal data of any user.

Most web site browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, or to refuse all cookies. However, if you choose to disable the receipt of cookies from our web site, you may not be able to use certain features of Scoot.

## What information do we collect?

We only collect information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you with your permission for example your name, address, email address, and telephone number.

We will also collect data when you request products and services so that we can tailor Scoot to your specific needs. For example, if you are a regular user of our Cinema Guide and you have given us permission to contact you by email, we may send you information of any cinema-related competitions or promotions that we run.

We also monitor general call centre requests, web site traffic, and user opinions to help us to continually improve Scoot.

## Why do we collect this information?

We collect personal information to provide you with the most relevant service possible. This means in terms of related products and services, and targeted advertising, you only receive information you are interested in.

## How do we use personal information?

We use personal information:

  * To understand more about you so that we can tailor Scoot whenever you access it.
  * To summarise usage behaviour for advertisers and partners, and to describe our service and performance. This is not based on individual behaviour but is generic.
  * To improve Scoot.
  * For other personalised value-added services to which you have specifically subscribed to.



By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this policy. If we change our privacy policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the website, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it at all times. Continued use of Scoot will mean that you agree to any such changes. Owing to the global nature of the Internet infrastructure, the information you provide may be transferred in transit to countries outside the European Economic Area that do not have similar protections in place regarding your data and its use as set out in this policy. By submitting your information you consent to these transfers.

## What information is collected automatically?

Our web servers automatically collect information about a site user's IP address, browser type, and referrer by reading this information from the user's browser (information provided by every user's browser).

## How do we protect your information?

The internet is not a secure medium. However, in order to prevent unauthorised access, we use strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information that you have given to us. We use all reasonable endeavours to ensure the security of personal data stored on our system.

All your personal information is password protected and only certain customers who have purchased certain specific products from us have limited password protected access to their own information.

## What about sensitive personal information?

Sensitive personal information such as religious beliefs, details on mental/physical health, etc will be not stored by us or used in any way other than for the immediate search taking place.

When you register, or when you give us your personal details while using Scoot, you acknowledge and accept that your information may be used for marketing activities, or to receive additional offers and information from us and/or third parties.

## Do we share information?

We will not disclose your personally identifiable information to any person or company except where you have given us permission to do so, or if the law requires it, or where in good faith we believe such action is necessary to fulfil the service.

## What happens if we sell the Scoot business?

If this business is sold or integrated with another business your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers and will be passed on to the new owners of the business.
