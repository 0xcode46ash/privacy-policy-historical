# Welcome to Scoot, the UK Business Finder

At British Telecommunications plc (BT) we are committed to protecting your privacy. You can provide us with as much, or as little, personal information as you feel comfortable with. We use the information we collect to make your Scoot experience, across all our communication channels, a rewarding one.

Whether you use the Scoot service (service) over the phone (landline or mobile), the Internet, WAP, or interactive TV, our data collection and usage policy allows you to control the personal information you give to us and what we can do with it. In this way your privacy is guaranteed.

We aim to build your trust and confidence in the service and we will not hold or use your personal details without your permission.

**What information do we collect?**

BT only collects information that personally identifies you or allows BT to contact you with your permission.

We will also collect data when you request products and services so that we can tailor our service to your specific needs. For example, if you are a regular user of our Cinema Guide and you have given us permission to contact you by email, we may send you information of any cinema-related competitions or promotions that we run.

BT also monitors general call centre requests, web site traffic, and user opinions to help continually improve the Scoot service.

**Why do we collect this information?**

We collect personal information to provide you with the most relevant service possible. This means in terms of related products and services, and targeted advertising, you only receive information you are interested in.

**How do we use personal information?**

BT uses personal information:  


  * To understand more about you so that we can tailor the service whenever you access it. 
  * To summarise usage behaviour for advertisers and partners, and to describe our service and performance. This is not based on individual behaviour but is generic. 
  * To improve the service. 
  * For other personalised value-added services to which you have specifically subscribed to. 



**What are cookies?**

Cookies are pieces of information that an interactive service (e.g. website, digital TV) transfers to your hardware (e.g. computer, set top box, etc) for record-keeping purposes. Scoot may use cookies where appropriate. If you are using a PC and do not wish to receive cookies you can switch them off using your browser’s Internet Options facility.

**How do we protect your information?**

In order to prevent unauthorised access, BT uses strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information that you have given to us. We use all reasonable endeavours to ensure the security of personal data stored on our system.

All your personal information is password protected – only registered users have access to their own information. As a registered user, you will be able to edit or delete your personal information details at any time using your own ID and password.

**What about sensitive personal information?**

Sensitive personal information such as religious beliefs, details on mental/physical health, etc will be not stored by BT or used in any way other than for the immediate search taking place. For example, if you search for a restaurant that has disabled access, BT will not store this information for future use.

**What choice does BT offer in relation to the collection, use and distribution of personal information?**

When you register, or when you give us your personal details while using the service, you will be asked to indicate whether you give permission for your information to be used for marketing activities, or to receive additional offers and information from BT. This is called permission marketing and you can amend your permission marketing status at any time if you no longer wish to receive information tailored to your needs.

**Does BT share information?**

We will not disclose your personally identifiable information to any person or company except where you have given us permission to do so, or if the law requires it, or where in good faith BT believes such action is necessary to fulfil the service.

**In summary**

We want to make your experience a good one. Your privacy is important. We want you to feel happy about the information you are giving us and to be able to retain control over the way it is used.

**If you have any queries or comments, please email us at:[feedback@scoot.co.uk](mailto:118500.dq.queries.team@bt.com).**
