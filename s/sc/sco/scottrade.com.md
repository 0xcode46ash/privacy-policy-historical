##  SCOTTRADE PRIVACY POLICY AND SECURITY STATEMENT 

### Your Privacy is Important

Privacy and security are as important to Scottrade as the timely and accurate execution of trades. This Privacy Policy and Security Statement describes how we protect your personal and financial information that we collect in the course of providing our financial services.

### Information We Collect

We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:

  * Information gathered from applications, forms and other information you provide us (for example, your name, address, social security number, assets, liabilities, and income);
  * Information about your transactions and your account experience, including your account balances, trading activity, and payment history;
  * Information from consumer reporting agencies regarding your creditworthiness and credit history; and
  * Information from other outside sources regarding their employment, credit, or other relationship with you, or verifying representations made by you to them, such as your employment history, loan or credit card balances, etc.



### Information We Disclose and To Whom We Disclose Information

Scottrade does not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law.

For example, we disclose information, as permitted by law, to nonaffiliated companies that work for us in providing financial services to you. These companies include those who prepare statements of your account, transaction confirmations, and credit reports. These companies are required to sign strict confidentiality agreements with Scottrade.

In addition, we disclose information, as permitted or required by law, to government and regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We will make disclosures to comply with a legal summons, court order, subpoena or similar legal process, a fraud investigation, audit, or examination.

Finally, we are permitted to disclose information if you have provided your consent.

Scottrade does not sell or rent personal information to any third party.

### Confidentiality and Security Procedures

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know such information to provide services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.

Scottrade offers a secure server and a password-protected environment. Personal information is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption.SSL encodes and decodes the transmission of your personal information to prevent the interception by another party. This transmission can be done on your Scottrade website at 128-bit encryption… currently the most powerful available. By viewing the URL/address/location line of your browser, you can determine if you are in a secure mode by looking for https://. (In contrast http:// would represent a non-secure transmission.)
