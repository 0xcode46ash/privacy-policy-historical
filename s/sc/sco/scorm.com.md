# SCORM - Privacy Policy » SCORM -

We respect your privacy and want you to know how we handle the information we receive via our website and through our online applications.

**Information We Collect**  
When you register for a SCORM Cloud account or take a course within SCORM Cloud we ask for information such as your name, company name and email address.

If you sign up for a free account you are not required to enter a credit card until you upgrade to a paid plan. Users of paid plans are required to enter their credit card number. Rustici Software uses a third party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain or use your billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on Rustici Software’s behalf.

We collect the email addresses and other contact information of people who correspond with us. We maintain records of our correspondence.

We collect aggregate information on the web pages and application functionality users access or visit.

We maintain all user-submitted data required for proper operation of SCORM Cloud. This data is collected to deliver and improve the services that we offer and includes e-learning content and the tracking data generated by learners experiencing their training (such as quiz scores, time spent in training and other SCORM data).

SCORM Cloud services may be directly accessed through other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to SCORM Cloud in order to deliver the service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy.You may access your personal information at anytime to correct, amend or delete it, where it’s inaccurate.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small piece of data that includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. We use cookies to track current session information and to streamline your login process. We do not require permanent cookies.

**Information Usage**  
Rustici Software uses your information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact and research.

**Information Sharing**  
Except as described in this policy, Rustici Software will not give, sell, rent or loan any personal information to any third party, unless:

  * It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service of the specific application, or as otherwise required by law.
  * Rustici Software is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Rustici Software will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



**Data Storage**  
Rustici Software uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage and other technology and services required to operate and maintain our services which may require that your personal information be transferred to these vendors and partners. Although Rustici Software owns the code, databases and all rights to the Rustici Software applications, you retain all rights to your data.

Rustici Software maintains reasonable security measures to protect your information from loss, destruction, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure. These technologies help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you provided authorized access. However, no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

**Children’s Personal Information**  
In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we do not knowingly request, solicit, access or receive personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. Our customers who use the SCORM Cloud product to run their training programs and store personal data may, however, collect personal data from children under the age 13 using this platform. Such parties are the “operators” of their respective websites as defined by COPPA. While it is our customers’ responsibility, not ours, to ensure compliance with COPPA, in the event we have actual notice that a customer has collected personal information in violation of COPPA, we will require such customer to take measures to comply with COPPA. Rustici Software disclaims all liability related to the collection and use of personal information by its customers.
