# Privacy Policy

Â   
Scour General Privacy Policy

Scour is committed to respecting and maintaining your personal privacy, and any privacy concerns you may have when using our sites. We want your experience here to be fun and stress-free. The last thing we want is to do is alienate you due to often overlooked, but very important, privacy issues.

The following information explains how we will treat personal information we collect on the Scour web sites. For privacy information specific to our Scour Exchange Application ("SX"), please see our [**SX Privacy Policy**](http://www.scour.com/Software/Scour_Exchange/Privacy_Policy.phtml).

**What Personally Identifiable Information Does Scour Collect From Its Users?**

Registration

To become a registered member of the Scour sites ( [**www.scour.com**](http://www.scour.com/) and [**www.scour.net**](http://www.scour.net/) ) and establish a Scour user name and password, we ask you to provide information about you, including your name, age, sex, connection speed, zip code and e-mail address. You are not required to provide any of this information to Scour or become a registered Scour member to use the Scour sites. Registration information may be required, however, if you are downloading or using additional software available from the Scour sites.

Communications

If you choose to receive e-mail communications from us like our newsletter or press releases trumpeting new and exciting information or additions to Scour, all we ask for is your e-mail address.

Contests and Promotions

At other times, we may ask you for personal information, including your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, your age and sex. We may, for instance, require you to provide certain information (i) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by Scour and/or one of its partners; (ii) when you submit a listing for a web site; or (iii) when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you are under the age of 13, Scour must have your parent's consent before you submit personal identifying information to us. Scour may keep a record of any correspondence you send us. 

Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. The word derives from the concept of cookie crumbs, or leaving a "trail" for us to follow. We use cookies to help provide customizable services, to make sure you don't see the same outside company ad banners all the time, and to understand how you navigate through our site so we can improve our service to you. 

**Opting Out**

Scour users have the option to remove their e-mail addresses from our mailing list so that they will no longer receive future communications from us. However, Scour does not provide users the opportunity to remove their registration information from our database once it has been submitted to Scour.

Communications

If you would like to be removed from our Scour Newsletter mailing list, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions on our [**Unsubscribe Page**](http://www.scour.net/Member/Newsletter.phtml) Unsubscribe Page 

Cookies

If you are at all concerned about Scour's use of cookies, you can choose whether to accept the cookies that we send to you by changing the settings of your browser. Just remember, if you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our site may not be up to snuff and some features may not work as intended.

Removing Your Site from Our Database

Scour uses "spiders" to search web sites, and may add your web site to our database, provided that your web site allows for such access. Once your web site is added to our database, Scour users may be able to query content from your web site. You may choose to remove your web site from our database or instruct Scour's "spiders" to stop searching your web site in the future by following the instructions on our [**Add or Remove Site**](http://www.scour.com/General/Misc/Add_Or_Remove_Site.phtml) page.

**How Scour Uses the Information It Collects from You**

As a general rule, we will not give or sell your personally identifiable information to third parties, except when we have your permission or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. You should accordingly understand that if served with a subpoena or like order from a court of competent jurisdiction requiring Scour to disclose user information, we will comply, disclosing all relevant user information in our possession. We may share non-personal aggregate, or summary, information regarding our users with business partners, advertisers or other third parties. We may also develop and possibly sell data profiles of individual users to third parties, but any such profiles given to third parties will not contain any personal identification information allowing the third party to link a particular profile with a specific person.

**Security**

Scour has various security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under its control. We use industry standard procedures and processes to safeguard the confidentiality of your identifiable personal information. Unfortunately, when you submit information about yourself to Scour over the Internet the information may travel over many systems that are not under the control of Scour. The Internet is not 100% secure and others may intercept the information that you are sending. Scour cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products and services, and you do so at your own risk.

**Children's Privacy**

Pursuant to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information on users under the age of 13, without the parent's consent to do so. If you are under the age of 13, we must obtain your parent's written permission before you submit any personal identifying information to Scour.
