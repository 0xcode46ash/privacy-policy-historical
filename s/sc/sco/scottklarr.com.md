## Privacy Policy

### What Information Is Collected

When you subscribe, you will be asked to provide your name, email address, and age, and your geographical location will be recorded based off your IP address.

### How Is It Used?

Your information is used solely for me to analyse my audience as a whole to determine the type of content I write and include in my newsletters. Your information will **never** be sold, leased, or available for any 3rd party. In fact, I personally will be the only one who even has access to the database.

### Abuse

Many newsletters will collect your "subscription approval" with shady methods basically allowing them to legally spam you. I hate spam just as much as you do and so I do not condone or take part in any sort of those activities. I pursue to maintain the quality of my newsletter by not selling any ad space in my newsletters, and by allowing easy unsubscribing that takes place immediately; not days, weeks, or even months like those shady guys. I will occasionally promote programs and products, but they are only when I feel that it is something beneficial to readers. You will not get a pile of ads from me!
