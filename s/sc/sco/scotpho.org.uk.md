### Scotland’s Health on the Web

The ScotPHO website is hosted on a server managed and maintained by the Scotland’s Health on the Web (SHOW) team, which is part of [NHS National Services Scotland](http://www.nhsnss.org/) (NSS). SHOW has its own [privacy and data protection policy](http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/policies/privacy.aspx). Log files are maintained and analysed of all requests for files on NSS servers. Aggregated analyses of these log files are used to monitor website usage. All log file information collected by NSS is kept secure and is not provided to any third parties. NSS will make no attempt to identify individual users. You should be aware, however, that access to web pages will generally create log file entries in the systems of your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or network services provider. These entities may identify the client computer equipment used to access a page. Such monitoring is outwith the responsibility or control of both NSS and the ScotPHO collaboration.
