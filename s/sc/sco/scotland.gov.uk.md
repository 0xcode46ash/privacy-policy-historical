However, the information on the website does not constitute legal or professional advice and the Scottish Executive cannot accept any liability for actions arising from its use. The Scottish Executive cannot be held responsible for the contents of any pages referenced by an external link.

Any personal data collected through this website will be treated as confidential in line with the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998.

#### Cookies and Website Traffic Analysis

When users enter the Scottish Executive website their computers will automatically be issued with ‘cookies’. Cookies are text files which identify users’ computers to the Scottish Executive’s server. The website then creates "session" cookies to store some of the preferences of users moving around the website, e.g. retaining a text-only preference. Cookies in themselves do not identify individual users but identify only the computer used and they are deleted on departure from the website.

Many websites do this to track traffic flows, whenever users visit those websites. 

The Scottish Executive website uses third-party cookies to measure use of the website including number of visitors, how frequently pages are viewed, and the city and country of origin of users. This helps to determine what is popular and can influence future content and development. For this purpose, the Executive uses Sitestat 4.0 of Nedstat Bv to measure and analyse usage of the SE website. The information collected by the Scottish Executive will include IP Address, pages visited, browser type and operating system. **The data will not be used to identify any user personally**.

Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user.
