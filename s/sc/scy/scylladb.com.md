# Privacy Policy - ScyllaDB

## Version 1.5, 8 Aug 2016

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, ScyllaDB collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. From time to time, ScyllaDB may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its websites. ScyllaDB also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. ScyllaDB does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to ScyllaDB’s websites (including scylladb.com, osv.io, cloudius-systems.com, and seastar-project.org) interact with ScyllaDB in ways that can result in ScyllaDB gathering personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ScyllaDB gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. ScyllaDB does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Gathering of Scylla host information

The Scylla software reports certain information to us by default, including but not limited to the version of Scylla installed on a node. By installing Scylla software in its default configuration you agree to data collection. You may at any time disable this data collection by reconfiguring Scylla.

### Aggregated Statistics

ScyllaDB may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, ScyllaDB may reveal how many downloads a particular version got, or say which platforms are most popular. However, ScyllaDB does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

ScyllaDB discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ScyllaDB’s behalf or to provide services available at ScyllaDB’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ScyllaDB’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, ScyllaDB discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when ScyllaDB believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ScyllaDB, third parties, or the public at large. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. ScyllaDB takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. ScyllaDB uses cookies to help ScyllaDB identify and track visitors, their usage of ScyllaDB website, and their website access preferences. ScyllaDB visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using ScyllaDB’s websites. Certain features of ScyllaDB’s websites may not function properly without cookies.

### Privacy Policy Changes

ScyllaDB may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in ScyllaDB’s sole discretion. ScyllaDB encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of ScyllaDB sites after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
