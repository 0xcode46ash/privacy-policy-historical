##### ScubaEarth® Privacy Policy

The PADI Companies (“PADI”), the producers of ScubaEarth, are committed to respecting the privacy of visitors to ScubaEarth. This Privacy Policy covers personally identifiable information that may be provided to ScubaEarth during visits to the website. As explained below, the information provided during various types of interactions may be treated differently. Changes to the Privacy Policy will be posted on this page. Any changes will only apply to information collected after the posted date of any such change.  


##### What security is provided by ScubaEarth?

ScubaEarth uses a number of security measures to maintain the privacy of the personal information collected. The data are stored in secure databases and are accessed only for the purposes listed within the Privacy Policy.  


##### What information is received about visitors to ScubaEarth?

When someone registers on ScubaEarth, the following information may be obtained: email address, name, mailing address, phone number, personal demographic information, etc. Additionally, in certain portions of the site, such as the Dive Log, Gear Locker and Show My PADI Certifications Online, visitors may voluntarily decide to provide additional information such as dive, dive training and equipment preferences, dive details, etc. or post questions and make other inquiries, as relevant to each such function or opportunity within the site. Certain portions of the site will allow visitors to upload photographic and video images. 

##### Other information received about visitors to ScubaEarth, and how it is used:

ScubaEarth receives data about visitors whenever they interact with the site, such as when they look at the various sections or features of the site; review a dive destination or equipment description; send a question to “Ask an Expert”; click on an ad; and so on. 

ScubaEarth receives data from computers, mobile phones or other devices visitors use to access the site. This may include such information as IP address, location, the type of browser used, time of the visit and the pages visited. Some functions, such as Dive Shop Locator, may also obtain GPS location to determine the nearest PADI Dive Center.

When a visitor posts photos or videos on the site, ScubaEarth may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place the photo or video was taken.

ScubaEarth compiles data and creates collections of aggregate data from the information gathered from and about visitors to assist PADI and ScubaEarth and their advertising and promotional partners in tailoring content and communications to individual interests. For example, compilations of the equipment planning and preferences indicated by postings to the Gear Locker may be provided to manufacturers offering the types of equipment listed in individual Gear Lockers (individual preferences will not be revealed, unless the information has been marked “Everyone” as described below). Similarly, individual interests shown in Dive Destinations’ content can help ScubaEarth provide visitors with opportunities tailored to their personal dive travel preferences.

##### Service Providers

ScubaEarth may give visitors’ information to the people and companies that help ScubaEarth provide its services. For example, outside vendors may be used to help host the website, host photos and videos, process payments or provide search results, and, in some cases, ScubaEarth may provide a service jointly with another company. When working with third parties in these ways, ScubaEarth will enter into confidentiality agreements through which the vendors agree to only use visitor information in a manner consistent with ScubaEarth’s Privacy Policy. However, if ScubaEarth were to use a third party not bound by such a confidentiality agreement in the future, the third party will be indentified. In such a case, it is the responsibility of the user to read and consider the third party’s Privacy Policy/Terms and Conditions prior to accessing that feature or function.  


##### Personal Decisions Concerning Privacy

Registered ScubaEarth users will have the ability to designate much of their information as “Everyone,” “Buddies” or “Only Me.” When an individual’s information is designated as “Only Me,” it will be used only within compilations of aggregate information for the purposes of establishing trends, usage patterns and frequency, regional activity, etc. and will not include any individually identifiable data.  


##### What about third party links on ScubaEarth?

ScubaEarth provides links to other sites as a service to visitors. ScubaEarth is not responsible for the privacy practices, security measures or data collection practices of other web sites, or for their content. The choice to access these sites is at the visitor’s own risk.

##### What does ScubaEarth use to track information from visitors?

ScubaEarth uses various standard web measuring tools, such as Omniture and Google Analytics, to trace ScubaEarth’s visitor movements through the site.

##### Special Considerations Regarding Children under 13 Years of Age

While ScubaEarth cannot prevent children under 13 years of age from visiting and viewing the public portions of the ScubaEarth website, in a commitment to safe-guard their online privacy, clear notice is given that children under 13 are not permitted to register on ScubaEarth. The required birth date field will not allow the registration to continue when a birth date indicating less than 13 years of age is entered. Only registered visitors are allowed entry to the interactive portions of the site, which prevents personal information from being collected on children known to be younger than 13. ScubaEarth does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If ScubaEarth becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, reasonable steps will be taken to remove such information and terminate the child's account. ScubaEarth strongly encourages parents and guardians to supervise the activity of all children under the age of 18 in the use of the internet.

ScubaEarth is compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). For more information on COPPA, visit: http://www.coppa.org

##### Advertising

ScubaEarth does not share individual visitor information with advertisers. After an ad runs, ScubaEarth may provide advertisers with reports on how their ads performed; for example, reports telling advertisers how many users saw or clicked on their ads. Some advertisers may place cookies on a visitor’s computer.  
  

  **Cookies**  
 A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card, recording your passwords, purchases, and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages, and may be precluded from ordering or from maintaining an account on this Site.)   


##### Disclosure by Law or for Safety

ScubaEarth may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request, to protect the safety of any person, or to protect PADI’s rights or property.  


##### Closing Personal Accounts

Registered users may close their accounts at any time. Once the account is closed, the personal information within it is no longer accessible. However, the data will continue to be included within compilations of anonymous information, in which no individual information is identifiable.
