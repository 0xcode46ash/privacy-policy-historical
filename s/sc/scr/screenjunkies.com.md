# Privacy Policy | Screen Junkies

**ScreenJunkies  Privacy Policy**

**Effective as of February 20, 2009**

At ScreenJunkies.com, a website operated by ChickiP, LLC (“ChickiP”), we are committed to respecting people’s privacy online. We are also committed to providing you with the very best experience we can on our website. In order to do so, we may gather certain personal information about you. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our website. By using ScreenJunkies.com, you consent to the collection and use of your information by ChickiP as described in this Policy, and you signify your agreement to the ScreenJunkies  Privacy Policy.

### Information submitted by you for inclusion on your ScreenJunkies  profile.

Information, pictures and media files you upload to your account (“Submissions”) will be posted on the site, subject to our Users Terms and Conditions and accessible by all visitors to the site (unless you expressly restrict such access through your account settings), and ChikiP has no control over, and shall incur no responsibility for, how such visitors will use such Submissions.   ChikiP reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit Submissions, but does not regularly review Submissions.

Please remember that if you post any of your personal information in public areas of the website, such as in online forums or chat rooms, such information may be collected and used by others over whom we have no control. We are not responsible for the use made by third parties of information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of the website.

**What information does ChickiP collect?**

When you visit ScreenJunkies.com, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes which pages are visited and any feedback from our visitors. We then aggregate this information with other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible.

When you register for the website, we collect personal information such as name, age, and email in order to set up your account.  

In addition to the information we collect upon your initial registration with ScreenJunkies.com, we may ask you for personal information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter promotions or contests, and when you respond to a survey.

Upon cancelling your ScreenJunkies account, you have the right to request deletion of your account information, subject to our need to keep appropriate archives for our business operations.

**What do we do with the information we collect?**

1.      It is used to set up and maintain your ScreenJunkies.com account.  If you provide us with your mobile phone information, we may use such information to communicate with you regarding ScreenJunkies.com by SMS, MMS, text message or other electronic means to a mobile device.

2.  Your phone number may be used in the event that our customer service representatives need to contact you and cannot reach you by email.

3.  Your personal information will never be sold to any other website owner or merchant. We hate junk mail as much as you. This is why we will only send you email about items that we feel you should know about. This includes special promotional items that ChickiP endorses, membership changes, terms and conditions changes, Holiday cards, and the latest happenings on ScreenJunkies.com.  When we send you emails that include a link to the website, that link may contain an alphanumeric identifier that allows us to identify the person to whom we sent the message so that we can personalize our content for that individual. 

Email Opt-out

Users who no longer wish to receive our email updates or other notifications may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instructions contained in the applicable email or by logging-in and changing their account settings.  

**With whom do we share your information and for what purpose?**

ChickiP does not sell, rent, or trade any personally identifying information with others. However, when one or more of our business partners co-sponsor a service, promotion and/or contest, we may share some or all of the information collected in connection with such service, promotion or contest with the co-sponsor(s). If we intend to share such information, you will be notified prior to the collection of that information. If you do not want your information to be shared, you will be able to choose not to allow the transfer by not using or signing up for that particular service, promotion or contest.

We may also share aggregate user information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to users more targeted advertising, products and services.  

We may contract with third parties to conduct research and marketing on our behalf.  Such third parties will be fully bound by an obligation of confidentiality to ChickiP and may not use any personally-identifiable information provided by us other than as expressly instructed by us and in strict compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

**What information do parties other than ChickiP collect?**

Some entities that have links on our site may collect personally identifying information about you when you access or utilize those links.  ChickiP does not control the collection or use of such information, and the practices of those advertisers and websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

It is important to note that those entities may not follow the same privacy policies as ChickiP. For instance, if you click on an advertisement on ScreenJunkies.com, you may be taken away from ScreenJunkies.com to an entirely different site.  These links can also be from advertisers, content providers and/or partners who may use ScreenJunkies.com’s logo and/or style as a result of a co-branding agreement yet they may still not follow the same privacy policies as ChickiP.

**What are “cookies” and “web beacons” and how do we use them?**

Our site may use “cookies” and “web beacons” to speed navigation, keep track of items, and provide you with custom-tailored services.  A “web beacon” is an embedded GIF file that specifically helps us track whether you have viewed a specific piece of content. We also use “cookies” to remember information you gave us so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the site. By showing us how and when visitors use the site, “cookies” and “web beacons” help us see which site areas and content are popular and which are not. We also collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to any sponsors.   Some advertisers or websites that have links on our site may also use their own “cookies.”

Most browsers are initially set to accept “cookies.” If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse “cookies.” You will not be able to use our service if you turn off the “cookies” option.

**Security**

Our member accounts are secured by member-created passwords.  In addition, we use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff.  

However, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of our member information at any time.

## Business transitions 

In the event ChickiP goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.

We make an effort to protect the personal information of all users of ScreenJunkies.com.  If you are unsure whether this privacy policy is in conflict with the rules applicable where you are located, you should not submit your personal information to ScreenJunkies.com. IN ADDITION, IF YOU ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION, YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, THE LAWS OF WHICH MAY BE DEEMED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION TO HAVE INADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION. Users of ScreenJunkies.com located in countries outside of the United States who submit personal information do thereby consent to the transfer of that information to and/or storage of the information in the United States.

**Cooperation with law enforcement; fraud protection**

ChickiP fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to disclose information about members who we believe are in violation of applicable laws or regulations, or as required to respond to a subpoena, court orders or other legal process requiring such disclosure. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful and to exchange information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection. 

**Changes to our Privacy Policy**

Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used or collected. From time to time, we may change our Privacy Policy and will notify you of those changes by email or post a notice on the ScreenJunkies.com website.  Users are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when they use ScreenJunkies.com after such changes have been first posted.  Please note that if you opt out of receiving legal notices from us, those legal notices will still govern your use of ScreenJunkies.com, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.
