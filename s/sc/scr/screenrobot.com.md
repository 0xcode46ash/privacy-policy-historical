# About Us/Privacy Policy - Screen Robot

Screen Robot is a site made for humans who spend too much time in front of screens.

We are a small team from the UK.

We aim to create a community of like-minded robots who love Film, TV, Gaming, and Tech.

We have a healthy obsession with digital everything.
