# SCREEN IT! PRIVACY STATEMENT

### **SCREEN IT! PRIVACY POLICY**

Screen It! has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for our web site. 

**Information Automatically Logged**  
As with most websites, your IP address (something that looks like this: "cache-dp03.proxy.aol.com" but NOT your email address) is automatically logged by our hosting service's server to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Other than our [hosting service](http://www.adgrafix.com/) having access to these logs, this information is neither used nor distributed to any other entity in any form. 

**Cookies & Advertisers**  
The 3rd party advertising companies our site uses to sell advertising on our site use "cookies" in an effort to make sure that you hopefully don't see the same ad repeatedly. We do not have access to this information. Please see their respective sites for their privacy policy on using such information. [Burst](http://www.burstmedia.com/release/privacy.asp). [Flycast](http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html). 

**Our online survey**  
We run an optional survey to collect brief personal and activity based information of our users who opt to fill out the survey. The information is used only in aggregate with such information that's collected from all users only being used in the form of an average profile of our users. After such compilation, the individual information is deleted and is never distributed to any outside entity. 

**Screen It Newsletter**  
We provide a free weekly newsletter for those who opt-in to receive it. Email addresses submitted by users for this purpose are only used to distribute our weekly newsletter and are never distributed/sold/leased to any outside entity. For those who wish to opt-out from receiving our newsletter, please send an email to [screenit@oaknetpub.com](mailto:screenit@oaknetpub.com) with only the word REMOVE in the body of the email message (from the email account you wish to remove). 

**Registration Forms**  
Our site's registration form (for signing up for the possibility to win sneak preview passes -- Washington, DC area only) requires users to give us contact information (like their name, email, and postal address). Such contact information from the registration forms is only used to verify that those who are registering actually live in the Washington, DC area. Those who sign up for this service will only receive email notices related directly to the availability of sneak preview passes. Those who no longer wish to receive them can opt-out of receiving future mailings by notifying us at: [reviews@screenit.com](mailto:reviews@screenit.com). 

**External Links**  
This site contains links to other sites. Screen It! is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

**Public Forums**  
In the future, this site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. If/when that happens, please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

**Security**  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information (as listed above) under our control. 

**Children's Guidelines**  
This site does not collect specific information from children (other than as stated above for the user demographic survey or the opt-in/opt-out sneak preview sign up sheet). As such, our site meets the Online Privacy Protection Act guidelines as related to children. 

**Contacting the Web Site**  
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact: [reviews@screenit.com](mailto:reviews@screenit.com).
