  * Which [site you came from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer) (Twitter, Reddit, a forum, etc)
  * Your public IP address
  * Your browser version (Safari, Firefox, Chrome, etc)
  * Your operating system version (macOS, Windows, iPhone, etc)

## Bot Tracking

When you use the Scryfall chat bots, the bots listen in your channel so that they can react to messages you send. The messages are sent to our servers for inspection, but **we do not permanently save your messages or send them to anyone else**. That said, **if you discuss vitally secret or life-threatening information on your server, please do not install our chatbots.**

When you use our bots:

  * We keep track of what cards people ask for
  * We collect anonymous statistics about bot usage, such as the hours of the day your server uses the bots and which features you use



We collect this information so that we can make better decisions about how to improve the bots. We never sell or share this information with any other company.

## API Tracking

When you use the Scryfall API or any of the chat bots or tools we provide, we collect some information. For example:

  * We keep track of what people search for.
  * We collect statistics about where the API request came from, such as the public IP address, country, and city.



We collect this information so that we can make better decisions about how to improve the API. We never sell this information to any other company.

## Encryption

When you use Scryfall, your browser connects over an [encrypted channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS). This accomplishes two things:

  1. It prevents someone else from snooping on what you search for and do on this site
  2. It likely speeds up your connection to the site by blocking certain kinds of interference



You can [analyze our setup on Qualys SSLLabs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=scryfall.com) and the [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze.html?host=scryfall.com). We’re rather proud of it.
