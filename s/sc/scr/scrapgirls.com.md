# Scrap Girls - Privacy Policy

**1\. The information we collect**

When you use the Scrap Girls.com site, we receive and collect certain information. The information that we receive and collect depends on what you do when you visit Scrap Girls.com. 

  * _Automatically Collected Information_. Some information is automatically received and sometimes collected from you when you visit the Scrap Girls.com site. We receive and collect the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our site. We use this information to monitor the usage of our site. 

  * _Information Collected via Cookies_

. We use cookies to enhance the browsing and shopping experience on the Scrap Girls.com site. "Cookies" are small files or records that we place on your computer's hard drive to collect information about your activities on the Scrap Girls.com site. The cookies transmit this information back to the computers at Scrap Girls.com or possible third-party distributors of banners and newsletters; these computers are, generally speaking, the only computers which are authorized to read such information. The information captured makes it possible for us (i) to speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping cart ii) to remember information you gave to us so you don't have to reenter it each time you visit the Scrap Girls.com site; (iii) to monitor the effectiveness of certain of our marketing campaigns; and (iv) to monitor total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of banners served. 

  Most people do not know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit the Scrap Girls.com site or most web sites because browsers are typically set to accept cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie placement. If you refuse cookies, you will not be able to open a Scrap Girls.com Shopping Cart and therefore will not be able to complete an order with us online. Also, by not using cookies, your overall Internet browsing experience will be affected. 

  If you would like to obtain more information about the third-party distributor of banners on the Scrap Girls.com site and to know your choices about having such distributor's cookies turned off, please visit [www.privacychoices.org](http://www.privacychoices.org/).

  * _Information You Actively Submit to Scrap Girls.com_

. For most of the browsing services we provide, we neither require nor collect "Personal Customer Information" -- your name, email address, billing address, shipping address(es), phone number and credit card information. You can browse the Scrap Girls.com site and take as much time as you want to review our books and other products, services and reviews without having to submit such Personal Customer Information. Even when you use our shopping cart as you browse, there is no need to submit Personal Customer Information. 

  In the following instances, however, we do need you to actively submit Personal Customer Information: when you want to (to (i) create an account; (ii) complete an order; (iii) subscribe to our newsletter, (iv) sign up for memberships, such as to participate on our message board (v) participate in future courses in our Scrap Girls University.



    * **Creating a Scrap Girls.com Account.** You can create a new pasword-protected Scrap Girls.com account to complete an order or to set up a Wish List. To create an account, we require that you provide us with the following Personal Customer Information: your email address (which may not be associated with another active Scrap Girls.com account), and your first and last names. You will also have to create a password, select a security question and input a security answer. 

    * **Completing an Order.** To complete an order, we require you to access your password protected Scrap Girls.com account. You will access stored Personal Customer Information or be asked to submit additional Personal Customer Information such as your credit card number and billing address. 

    * **Chit Chat Newsletter**. You may sign up for our free email newsletter, Chit Chat, filled with recommendations and ideas for scrapbooking, cardmaking, paper crafting projects and more. To do so, you will need to supply your email address during this sign up. Please note that this newsletter registry is different from the Scrap Girls.com Account and password which you set up to make purchases. You can sign up for our newsletter whether or not you have a Scrap Girls.com account. Furthermore, the contact information collected in the newsletter is only used to forward the newsletter. It must be a separate registry otherwise your shopping account would be disabled even should you simply desire to stop receiving email newsletters. 

    * **Message Board.** When you sign up message board or gallery participation, we ask you to disclose your email address during this registration. Scrap Girls uses a vendor, iPower, to host our message board so that it is maintained in an efficient manner and so that it isn't subject to the type of internet attacks that many of the free software message board have experienced recently. You may choose to receive email messages from the administrators of the message board or other participants or to not receive such messages as the time of your registration. Your email address will not be displayed to the public. Any other personal information that you wish to include in your profile may be shared or hidden, according to your own preferences, as you control this access completely.




**2\. How we use and share Personal Customer Information**

Credit card companies. Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution and their vendors, which receive the credit card number and other personal identifying information only to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions.

  Physical Fulfillment Orders at Scrap Girls Bookstores. Any product that involves some type physical fulfillment requires that we provide the fulfillment agent for the item you have ordered with limited access to billing and shipping addresses of our account holders. Such affiliate does not have access to credit card information or order history and cannot make changes to customer accounts.

  Law Enforcement Investigations. Scrap Girls.com may release Personal Customer Information when we believe, in our good judgment, that such release is reasonably necessary to comply with law, enforce or apply the terms of any of our policies or user agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Scrap Girls.com, our users, or others.

**4\. Underage customers**

Our products and services are marketed for purchase by adults or with the consent of adults. This is why Scrap Girls.com requires a credit card or a PayPal that has been authorized for use to complete purchases on our site. 

**5\. Linking to third-party web sites**

When you click on links and banners on our site that take you to third-party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies. While we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, Scrap Girls.com cannot be responsible for the actions of any third-party web sites. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement of any and every site you visit, whether you are linking from our site or browsing on your own.

**7\. Questions or comments**

If you have any questions regarding our Privacy Policy, please email using the information found on our [contact page](https://web.archive.org/web/20071210122840id_/http%3A//www.scrapgirls.com/About_Us.html).  
   


Security Policy

**1\. Protecting your information**

The **Personal Customer Information** you provide -- including your credit card information -- to create and access an account with us and to make purchases from us is secured using industry standard e-commerce security technology such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. We use this SSL technology to prevent such information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted over the Internet. The encrypted data goes to a secure site where your information is stored on restricted-access computers located at restricted-access sites. 

    
**2\. Unique Email, Password & Security Answer**

To further secure your Personal Customer Information: 

> We cross check an email address with the submitted password to validate access to any Scrap Girls.com customer account. 
> 
>   We do not allow any email address to access more than one Scrap Girls.com account. When a new Scrap Girls.com account is created, we require you to submit an email address that is not associated with an existing Scrap Girls.com account. 

We encourage you to use a password and a security answer that is not easily determinable (e.g., don't use your name or street name). Keep your password and security answer secure; do not share it with anyone. Password and security answer are the "keys" to your account; anyone who gets these "keys" can, along with your email address, gain access to your account. 

  If you forget your password, to gain access to your account you will need to know your security answer and have access to your email account. On the Account Sign In Page click on the Forgot your password? link and then type in the email address of the account you would like to open. A message will be sent to your email address with instructions on how to access your account and change your password. (If you have not yet selected a security question and submitted a security answer, you will be prompted to contact Customer Service for further assistance.) 

  If you want to change your password, security answer or other account information, simply log onto your account and follow the instructions on the page headed "Account Management Options." 

**3\. Remember to sign out**

To further prevent unauthorized access to your account, remember that, after you sign in, you should sign out once you have (i) completed your transaction, (ii) completed managing your account, or (iii) decided to step away from your computer. Anyone who accesses your computer after you have signed in but before you have either signed out or your session has timed-out can access your account. 

**4\. Safe Shopping Guarantee**

Under federal law, a credit card issuer cannot make you liable for charges in excess of $50.00 that result from the unauthorized use of your credit card. There are similar federal laws that relate to debit cards. Exceptions do apply, and you will have to comply with the rules of your credit card or debit card issuer, so please contact your card issuer for further details. 

  If a credit card or debit card issuer assesses you a fee because of the unauthorized use of your credit card or debit card on our site, Scrap Girls.com will reimburse you for such amount up to $50.00. Please contact our Customer Service for details. 

  Please be advised, we do not guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to the Scrap Girls.com site because the operation of the Scrap Girls.com website may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. 

 

**5\. Alternative customer purchasing options**

If you do not feel comfortable sending your credit card information to us over the Internet, you still can shop with us. 

**6\. Changes to security policy**

Scrap Girls.com reserves the right to modify or amend this policy at any time by posting the revised Security Policy on our site. The changes will only affect the information we collect after the effective date of the change to our Security Policy unless we clearly express otherwise.
