# Privacy Policy

### Our Commitment to Your Privacy

This privacy policy applies to [http://www.screensteps.com](https://www.screensteps.com/) (the "Site"), a website operated by Blue Mango Learning Systems, LLC (the “Company”).

The Site includes customer subdomains, e.g. company-name.screenstepslive.com.

The Site provides the "Service" as defined in the [Terms of Use](https://www.screensteps.com/terms-of-service).

We respect and protect the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your information and is part of our [Terms of Use](https://www.screensteps.com/terms-of-service) when you use our Site or Service.

### Your Consent

By using our Site or Service, you consent to our Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree, please don’t use our Site or Service.

### What information do we collect?

When you, as an employee, register for the Service you'll be asked to provide certain information about yourself, such as your name and email address.

We will collect and store whatever information you chose to send or receive using the Service, including User Content (if any) as defined in the Terms of Use.

If you, as a business, sign up for a paid version of the Service, we will collect your name, email, and billing information.

We and our third-party service providers may collect certain information about your use of our Site and Service. For example, we may collect and/or use:

  * Log information (including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring and exit pages, operating system, dates/time of access, and related data)
  * Information collected by cookies and tracking pixels (as discussed below)
  * Web beacons (also called "Internet tags" or "clear gifs"; used to count visitors to our Site and which pages were viewed and links clicked)
  * Embedded scripts (code temporarily downloaded onto your device to collect information about your interactions with the Service and thereafter deleted or deactivated)



### Where do we store your information?

Your information may be stored in our own servers or in servers owned by third-party cloud storage providers.

Third-party storage providers may not use your information except as provided in this Privacy Policy.

### How do we use your information?

Information and User Content we collect from you might be used:

  * To provide you with Services
  * To improve our Site and Services
  * For our marketing purposes
  * To respond to your messages and comments
  * To send you technical notices



### Do we use cookies or Tracking Pixels?

Yes.

Cookies are small files that include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies let us recognize your browser and remember certain information about you in order to personalize your experience of our Site and Service.

We also use cookies to compile aggregate data about traffic to our Site so that we can improve our Site.

We may use both persistent and session cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them; session cookies expire when you close your browser.  

A tracking pixel is a tiny pixel-sized image that allows us to track your website visits, advertising impressions, and other types of Internet activity. It's also sometimes called a web bug, beacon, or page tag.

### Do We Use Google AdWords or other remarketing methods?

Not at the moment, but we may in the future.

We may use the Google AdWords or other remarketing services to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our Site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network.

Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to our Site. Any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy.

You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page.

### How Do We Respond to "Do Not Track" Signals

We may track your browsing behavior to better tailor suggestions and information for you.

Some third party sites also keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. 

You can opt out of certain tracking by adjusting the settings on your browser.  However, many websites (including the Site) may not respond to such signals.

There are also browser extensions that may block tracking.  Again, they may not be effective in all cases.

### How long do we store your information?

We intend to store your information and User Content indefinitely.

### What about links to other websites?

We may provide links to or compatibility with other websites.  However, we’re not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those websites or the information or content they contain.  

### How do we protect your information?

We use appropriate physical, electronic, and other procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. However, please be aware that the Internet is an inherently unsafe environment, and that hackers are constantly working to defeat security measures.

Thus, we cannot guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed, and you accept this risk.

### How can _you_ protect your information?

We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe by not sharing it or your password with others.  

### Do we disclose any information to outside parties?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personal information for commercial or marketing purposes.

We will, if required by a valid court order, provide your personal information in a civil or criminal proceeding.

### Not Intended for Children

Our Site and Service are not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly or specifically collect information from or about children under the age of 13.

### Changes to our Privacy Policy

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page. We may also, but are not required to, send you an email notice.
