# Privacy Policy - Scripps Health - San Diego

Last Updated: 11/4/08

**By using this Web site, you agree to the following Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these terms, please do not use this Web site. Scripps Health reserves the right to change, modify, add, or delete portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. Your continued use of this Web site following any changes to the Privacy Policy will mean that you accept those changes. Please refer to the date listed above to determine when the last changes were made.**

#### Use of Personal Information/Privacy

This Web site is owned and operated by Scripps Health, a California nonprofit public benefit corporation. By using this site, you agree that Scripps Health may monitor your use of this Web site and may use the results of such monitoring without limitation.  
The information we gather generally can be categorized as either anonymous or personally identifiable.

Anonymous (or sometimes referred to as “aggregate”) information is information that cannot be traced back to a specific individual. For example, we know how many times our site and certain portions of our site are visited, but we do not know the names, e-mail addresses or gender of our visitors unless they specifically provide that information. We use this anonymous information to obtain a better understanding of how visitors use our Web site and to make decisions on how to improve it. Each time a visitor comes to our site, we collect some information in an effort to improve the overall quality of your online experience. We collect the visitor’s referral data (e.g., the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to our Web site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Safari browser on a Macintosh platform).

In addition to collecting these types of information, Scripps Health collects aggregate queries for internal reporting. We also count, track, and aggregate the visitor’s activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our site (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within our site, etc.).

During your visit to our Web site, we may request and collect personally identifiable information from you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number and any other personal information you share with us. The information you will be asked to provide to us is voluntary only; you will always have the option of not providing the information if you so choose. The information we gather from you is used either in connection with your interest in employment opportunities with Scripps Health, or if you have questions or comments you would like to share with Scripps Health.

Scripps Health does not disclose, give, sell, or transfer any personal information to third parties for non-Scripps use. Personally identifiable information may be collected from visitors to our site and provided in an aggregate form to other parties within the Scripps Health family for marketing, advertising or other similar uses.

We provide several ways to e-mail us with questions you may have as you navigate through our site. Please note that any information sent through an e-mail message is unsecured and can be seen on computers which transfer data from your computer to Scripps Health. **We recommend that you do not email sensitive personal health information, or any other confidential information, to Scripps Health or anyone else.** Should you choose to provide information in this manner, you do so at your own risk.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information collected offline. This information is available on the [Notice of Privacy Practices](https://web.archive.org/notice-of-privacy-practices "Notice of Privacy Practices") page.

#### Security

We take precautions to maintain the confidentiality of your information; however, you must keep in mind as you navigate through our Web site that any message you may send through the Web site or through email is not secure and may be susceptible to third party interception. As a result, you transmit information to us at your own risk.

#### Cookies

We may place small data files, called “cookies,” in your browser’s file storage area of your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are a standard Internet technology that allow us to both store and retrieve login information on a user’s system. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a site visitor’s computer to gather and keep track of information related to you. These cookies automatically identify your browser to our server whenever you interact with a service provided on our Web site. Cookies can store your preferences through a password you select to access a Web site. Cookies also help us review Web site traffic patterns and improve our site. Most browsers automatically accept these cookies, but you usually can change your browser setting to prevent the acceptance of cookies, though this may prevent you from using some of the features of our Web site. Information collected through cookies is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

#### Log Files

We collect and log IP addresses in order to analyze site visitation trends and administer the Web site. An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. IP addresses allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with one another. IP address information allows us to properly administer our system and gather aggregate information on visitors to our Web site. Ip address information also helps diagnose problems with our servers, and how our site is being used, including the pages visitors are viewing in the aggregate. This aggregate information may be shared with third parties, such as our physicians, our suppliers and other businesses. To maintain your anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information. In other words, IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

#### Links

Our Web site may contains links to Web sites that are not operated by Scripps Health. You may be asked by these Web sites to provide personal information or to release information you may have provided on our site. You are never required to release this information, and whether you do is optional and strictly up to you. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites, nor any adverse consequences that may result from your interaction with such third party Web sites. Scripps Health has no control or influence over the privacy practices of these other Web sites. This would also apply to these sites’ use of cookies and other electronically collected data. We encourage you to be cautious when leaving our Web site and review the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through those Web sites.

#### Children’s Privacy Protection

In accordance with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), Scripps Health will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without parental consent. When we do receive information (with parental consent) from users under the age of 13, we will not share their personally identifiable information with third parties, regardless of their stated preference given at registration.

#### Disclosures Required to Investigate Complaints to Law Enforcement Officials

Scripps Health may use personal information collected or in its possession to contact users in connection with their inappropriate use of our Web site, noncompliance with our Terms of Use, or in connection with a complaint filed about their use of our site by another user.

Scripps Health also may disclose your personal information to another party, such as law enforcement officials, to comply with legal requirements, court orders, government or law enforcement agency requests, to protect or defend Scripps Health, or where we perceive an immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to someone as a result of activity on our site. Our disclosures may occur under circumstances where we may not be authorized to advise you of such action.
