# Privacy Policy for ScreenConnect Website

Thank you for your interest in ScreenConnect Software, LLC ("ScreenConnect", "we", or "us"). This Privacy Policy describes ScreenConnectâ€™s privacy policy with regard to our Internet website located at http://www.screenconnect.com or any successor Internet website thereto (the "Site"). By visiting the Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. THIS PRIVACY POLICY MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME, SO PLEASE CHECK BACK PERIODICALLY.

ScreenConnect is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy and wants you to feel secure when visiting our site and providing information to us. We want you to know up front how we deal with any personally identifiable information you see fit to provide to us during our interactions with you. Therefore, this Privacy Policy will answer the following questions.

  * What personally identifiable information is collected from you and how will it be used?
  * What are cookies and how are they used?



In general, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. In fact, we encourage anonymous surfing so that you can find out more about who we are and how our products can help streamline your business needs. However, there are times when we may need and request personally identifiable information from you so that we can better serve you.

ScreenConnect will only collect personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address, employer name, employer address or products and operating systems you use) when it is voluntarily submitted to us at the Site. We will use this information to comply with your request for information or as otherwise disclosed to you at the location on the Site at which you submit your information. For example, if you request technical support assistance, we need to know who you are, what product you are using and in what computer system environment you are using the product in order to respond to your request as efficiently and effectively as possible. If you are interested in signing up for one of our Webinars, the personally identifiable information you provide will enable us to tailor the Webinar more closely to your specific needs. Also, when you request a product download from the Site, we want to be able to follow up with you to address any questions you might have about using our products. In addition, from time to time, we may refer to your personally identifiable information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services. We may use that information to contact you.

The information we collect about you or your computer will be used for various reasons, including to:

  * operate our website
  * provide customer support
  * respond to your requests or process any transactions you have authorized
  * verify your information
  * send you information or contact you in relation to a ScreenConnect product or service that you are using or that we believe may be of interest to you
  * aggregate your information with data that is separately provided by you on social media and third party websites if visible to third parties



When we collect information about you, such as your name or other details, it is our practice to provide you with the reason we will use it at the time you are asked for it. When we ask you to provide us with your information through a registration page or otherwise, you will have the option of not doing so, in which case you may still be able to access other portions of this website, although you may not be able to access certain programs or services.

In certain areas of our website, we may, where appropriate, enable you to "opt out" of certain uses of your information, or elect not to receive future communications or services.

In certain instances, we may make your information available to third parties with whom we have a relationship where that third party is providing services on our behalf. We will only provide those third parties with information that is necessary for them to perform the services and we take measures to protect your information.

We may also disclose the information to our business partners and or to social media sites for marketing and other purposes which we believe may be beneficial to you.

ScreenConnect is a global company and the information we collect may be used, stored and processed in the United States or in any other country in which ScreenConnect does business. By providing the information via the website, you are consenting to the transfer of the information outside of your country to any country (including countries which may not have adequate levels of protection).

ScreenConnect may disclose information it has collected about you on the website if required to do so by law or when necessary in order to protect the rights of ScreenConnect or its employees. Portions of this website make chat rooms, forums, blogs, message boards, and/or news groups available to visitors. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas could be made public so exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information.
