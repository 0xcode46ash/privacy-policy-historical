This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage. This policy also does not apply to information you choose to disclose publicly on the Website (i.e., information which is viewable to other Website users), which will not be considered Personal Information.

## II. What Personal Information Does Screenleap, Inc. Collect?

The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Website. We collect the following types of information from our customers:

**A. Personal Information You Provide to Us:**

We receive and store any information you provide to us. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, phone number, email address, friends names, credit card information, IP address, and browser information. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. We use the Personal Information you provide to enhance your Website experience.

**B. Personal Information Collected Automatically:**

Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, "cookie" information, and the page you requested.

"Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your computer through your browser that allow us to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your computer’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of our Website’s best features. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your computer, when you click on ads that appear on our site. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site), we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data tells us how often customers use parts of the Website, so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible. We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners, so that they can understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

**C. E-mail Communications:**

We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make emails more interesting and improve our service. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by opting out of our email notification services.

We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information in personally identifiable form only as described below.

**A. Advertisers:** We allow advertisers to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and you agree that we may use any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to allow our advertisers to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads for San Francisco businesses, but we will not willingly or knowingly tell such businesses who you are or provide them with any of your personally identifying information.

**B. Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:** In certain situations, businesses we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Website (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction.

Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
