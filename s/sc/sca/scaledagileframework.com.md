  5. **Information for Individuals in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom**
    1. Legal basis for processing personal information 

In this section, we identify the legal grounds on which we rely to process personal information.

In some cases, Scaled Agile has a legitimate interest to process the personal information that we collect, such as to develop, administer and support our products and services; to operate, evaluate and improve our business; or to facilitate a sale of assets or merger or acquisition.

In other cases, Scaled Agile processes personal information to fulfill our contracts with our business partners.

It may also be necessary for Scaled Agile to process personal information to establish, exercise or defend against fraud, illegal activity, and claims and other liabilities, including by enforcing the terms and conditions that govern the services we provide.

If Scaled Agile relies on consent for the processing of your personal information, we will seek such consent at the time we collect your personal information.  For more information on consent, please see the “Privacy Preferences and Rights” section of this Privacy Notice. 

    2. International data transfers  
We may transfer your personal information to countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. For example, if you are located outside of the United States, we typically transfer your personal information to the United States, where Scaled Agile is headquartered. The countries to which we transfer personal information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. 
    3. EU-US and Swiss Privacy Shield 

Scaled Agile complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. We have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Notice and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall take precedence. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, the Privacy Shield Principles and to view our certification, please visit [www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

As described in the [Privacy Shield Principles](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=Requirements-of-Participation), Scaled Agile is accountable for personal information that it receives and subsequently transfers to third parties acting as an agent on its behalf.  If third parties that process personal information on our behalf do so in a manner that does not comply with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are accountable, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Should anyone feel that we have not complied with the Privacy Shield principles related to the handling of personal information, and we have not been able to remedy such a complaint ourselves, they may contact JAMS, to the attention of Mara E. Satterthwaite, Esq. either at msatterthwaite@jamsadr.com or at the following address: 3800 Howard Hughes Parkway, 11th Floor, Las Vegas, NV 89169.

As further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, binding arbitration will also be made available to a complainant in order to address residual complaints not resolved by any other means. Scaled Agile is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). 

  6. **Online Privacy Choices**
    1. Advertising networks 

We work with advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and analytics companies (“Ad Partners”) that use different technologies to collect Automated Information in order to understand how our websites are being used, analyze where users go after they leave our websites in order to deliver relevant advertising. These advertisements may appear on other websites or services.

These Ad Partners may recognize a particular individual across third party websites over time and link various devices used by the same individual. For more information about how Ad Partners use the information collected by these technologies and about your options not to accept cookies placed by some of these companies on our websites, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s [opt-out page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

The opt-outs described above are device- and browser-specific and may not work on all devices.
