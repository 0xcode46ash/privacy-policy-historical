# Privacy Policy | ScanScout – Video Advertising that Guarantees Results

Opt-Out Privacy Policy  
ScanScout offers users the choice to select an "opt-out cookie" to prevent information from being uniquely associated with their browsers and ad optimization. Users can then opt-out of ScanScout's ad-serving cookies without erasing or altering other cookies associated with their browser.

When possible, we try to match the ads that we show you to your interests. We call this "ad optimization," (sometimes also called ad matching) and we do this in order to make the ads you see more relevant and useful for you. Ad matching uses data about your visits to ScanScout's ad network and about the ads you view and click. 

By selecting an opt-out cookie, ads delivered to your browser by ScanScout are targeted based only on the non-personally identifiable information that is available from the Internet environment, including information about your browser type and Internet service provider, and the general content of the site or page your browser is viewing. Also, please note that if you choose an opt-out cookie, ScanScout is unable to recognize your browser from one visit to the next, and you may therefore receive the same ad repeatedly. By receiving this cookie, ScanScout systems will know that you have opted out and will not attempt to assign other cookies in the future. Since the ScanScout opt-out cookie does not contain a unique user number, it does not allow us to identify your browser. If you opt-out the ads we show you will be more general and less relevant to you. Opting-out will not turn off ads. 

Effective Date: April 2, 2007   
At ScanScout we recognize that privacy is important and we are committed to ensuring the privacy of personas that use the ScanScout website (" _End-Users_ "), located at www.ScanScout.com (" _Site_ ").  This Privacy Policy (" _Policy_ ") describes what information is collected from End-Users and how such information is used and disclosed.  Terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the End-Users of our Site.  Terms "we," "us," and "our" refer to ScanScout, its subsidiaries and affiliates. 

PLEASE READ THIS POLICY CAREFULLY SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES.  BY USING THIS SITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE.  WE MAY PERIODICALLY MAKE CHANGES OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS POLICY AND IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REMAIN INFORMED ABOUT ANY SUCH CHANGES OR MODIFICATIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO PERIODICALLY REVIEW THIS POLICY TO STAY INFORMED ABOUT HOW WE ARE PROTECTING THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT.  YOU AGREE THAT YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THIS SITE CONSTITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THIS POLICY AND ANY FURTHER UPDATES AND MODIFICATIONS TO THIS POLICY, AS SUCH MAY BE MADE BY SCANSCOUT FROM TIME TO TIME. 

I. What type of information do we collect and how do we use it?  
Information gathered online can generally be categorized as either anonymous or personally identifiable, as follows: 

1\. _Personally Identifiable Information_. Personally identifiable information is information you provide to us that is uniquely associated with you, such as your name, physical mailing address, email address and telephone number.  Information identifying an entity other than an individual (e.g., a corporation, partnership, joint venture and so forth) does not constitute personally identifiable information. 

2\. _Anonymous Information_. Anonymous information is general information that cannot be traced back to a specific individual.  For instance, we know how many queries we receive each day, but we generally do not know the names and e-mail addresses of the personas submitting the queries.  Anonymous information can also include "aggregate data". Aggregate data is data we collect about a group or category of features, services or individuals, from which individual identities have been removed. For example, information about how you use or purchase a feature may be collected and combined with information about how others use or purchase the same feature, without any personal information included in the resulting data.  ScanScout uses aggregate data to help identify trends and understand End-Users needs so we can provide better features and services.

We do not sell, rent or share personal information with third parties without your prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy.  We share personal information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing internal functions necessary to operate our business.  These functions may include: analysis data, providing marketing assistance and processing payment transactions.  In all cases we limited the information shared with our third-party vendors to that which is necessary to carry out those functions.  We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with this Policy and use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information.  We are not, however, responsible for any information you provide to third party vendors directly, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them.

Additionally, information about our End-Users may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.

  * Monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns;

Additionally, information about our End-Users may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets. 

II. Security.  
We use reasonable security measures in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control.
