# Privacy Policy - Scandit

Effective as of July 21, 2015.

Protecting your private information is our priority. This statement of privacy applies to all the websites and mobile applications of Scandit and governs data collection and usage. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to Scandit include Scandit AG and its wholly owned subsidiary Scandit Inc. By using the Scandit website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement. If you do not agree with any part of this Privacy Policy, then we cannot make our websites, services, web and mobile applications available to you and you should stop accessing and using them.

**Collection of your Personal Information  **

Scandit may collect personally identifiable information, such as your name and email address if you enter these on our website or in our mobile applications either through the licensing or ordering of our software or services, or if you request us to contact you. We may gather additional personal or non-personal information in the future.

Information about your computer hardware and software will be automatically collected by Scandit. This information may include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the websites, the mobile applications and the services provided by Scandit, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Scandit websites, mobile applications and services.

Scandit encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to navigate to from Scandit so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Scandit is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Scandit website.

**Use of your Personal Information  **

Scandit collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and mobile applications and deliver the services you have requested.

Scandit may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Scandit and our partners. Scandit may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of our websites, mobile applications and other current or future products.

Scandit does not sell, rent or lease or provide in any other way its customer lists to third parties.

Scandit may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Scandit, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

Scandit may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within Scandit and which functionality in our mobile applications or services our users access, in order to determine what Scandit products and application features are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content within Scandit to customers whose behaviour indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

Scandit will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

(a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Scandit or the site

(b) protect and defend the rights or property of Scandit; and,

(c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Scandit, or the public.

**Use of Cookies  **

The Scandit website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you register with a Scandit site or subscribe for a Scandit service, a cookie helps Scandit to recall your information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Scandit website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Scandit features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Scandit services or websites you visit.

Scandit may also use other technologies with similar functionality to cookies, such as web beacons and tracking URLs. Scandit may also use web beacons and tracking URLs in emails to determine whether a recipient opened the email or accessed a certain link.

**Mobile Applications**

When you use the mobile applications published by Scandit through an app store, Scandit may collect, store and process a unique installation identifier, IP addresses and device information (such as mobile operating system or mobile device model), barcode information and location coordinates. Scandit uses this data to provide our services to users and to track the use of our mobile applications. If you have accepted an invitation to collaborate via the services offered by Scandit, Scandit may share such information with the party who invited you to collaborate.

**Security of your Personal Information  **

Scandit secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

**Children Under Thirteen  **

Scandit does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If you are under the age of thirteen, you must ask your parent or guardian for permission to use this website or our mobile applications.
