## Privacy Policy:

ScannerAnswers (" **ScannerAnswers** ") operates ScannerAnswers.com and may operate other websites. It is ScannerAnswers' policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, ScannerAnswers collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ScannerAnswers' purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ScannerAnswers' visitors use its website. From time to time, ScannerAnswers may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

ScannerAnswers also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on ScannerAnswers.com blogs/sites. ScannerAnswers only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to ScannerAnswers' websites choose to interact with ScannerAnswers in ways that require ScannerAnswers to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ScannerAnswers gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at [ScannerAnswers.com](http://scanneranswers.com/) to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with ScannerAnswers are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, ScannerAnswers collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with ScannerAnswers. ScannerAnswers does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

ScannerAnswers may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. ScannerAnswers may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, ScannerAnswers does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

ScannerAnswers discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ScannerAnswers' behalf or to provide services available at ScannerAnswers' websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ScannerAnswers' websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. ScannerAnswers will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, ScannerAnswers discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when ScannerAnswers believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ScannerAnswers, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an ScannerAnswers website and have supplied your email address, ScannerAnswers may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with ScannerAnswers and our products. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. ScannerAnswers takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

ScannerAnswers visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using ScannerAnswers' websites, with the drawback that certain features of ScannerAnswers' websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Business Transfers

If ScannerAnswers, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that ScannerAnswers goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of ScannerAnswers may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

### Ads
