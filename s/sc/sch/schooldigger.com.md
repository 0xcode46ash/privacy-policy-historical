Your privacy is important to us.

To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

We automatically receive and record information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, Schooldigger.com cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

**The Way We Use Information:**

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive and to process database correction requests and review submissions. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

**Our Commitment To Data Security:**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

**Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13. 

**Business Transfers:**

In the event of a transfer of ownership of SchoolDigger.com, such as acquisition by or merger with another company, a user's personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
