We and our service providers use cookies, tracking pixels and other tracking mechanisms, to track information about your use of our Site and the services available through our Site. We or our service providers may combine this information with other information we have received about you.

**_Cookies_**. A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on a computer’s hard disk so that it can remember the user. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the ‘lifetime’ of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our Site and to improve our Site, products and services. We predominantly use cookies for the following purposes:

  * Where they are essential to make our Site work.
  * To compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that help us to understand how users use our Site and to help us improve the structure of our Site.  



**_Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies._** Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are embedded invisibly on web pages. We or our service providers may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags) in connection with our Site to track the activities of visitors to our Site, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Site. We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our users, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.

_Third-Party Analytics_. We use automated devices and applications to evaluate usage of our Site and services. We use these tools to help us improve our services, performance and user experiences. These devices and applications may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services

Please see our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/corp/en/footer/cookies-policy/en.html) for additional information about our use of cookies, your ability to accept/decline cookies, and related information.

We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Site and on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information, including personal data, about you.

Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) [Consumer Choice Page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by [DAA companies](http://www.aboutads.info/participating/). You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) [Consumer Opt-Out Page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by [NAI members](http://www.networkadvertising.org/participating-networks).

Users in Canada may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (“DAAC”) [Opt-Out Tool](http://youradchoices.ca/choices/) to opt out of certain third-party ad networks’ interest based advertising. Additional information is available on the DAAC’s website at [youradchoices.ca](http://youradchoices.ca/). 

Users in the European Union may go the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (“EDAA”) [Your Online Choices website](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) and select their country to learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt out in their own country. For example, users in France may go to the [Contrôler ses cookies website](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/fr/controler-ses-cookies/) to opt out of certain third-party ad networks’ interest-based advertising and find additional information at [www.youronlinechoices.com/fr](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/fr/).

Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA [Consumer Choice Page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or the NAI [Consumer Opt-Out Page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/), the DAAC [Opt-Out Tool](http://youradchoices.ca/choices/), or through the various EDAA websites will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA, NAI, DAAC, and/or EDAA websites, your opt out may not be effective. Please note that if you use multiple devices you will have to opt out on each individual device.

Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may disable certain tracking as discussed above in our Cookies and Tracking Mechanisms section (e.g., by disabling cookies). To learn more about do-not-track signals, please see [this resource](https://allaboutdnt.com/).

Our Site may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.

We may use, disclose, process, transfer or store personal data outside the country in which it was collected, such as to the United States and other countries, which may not guarantee the same level of protection for personal data as the country in which you reside.

Additionally, there are situations when personal data is transmitted to third-party service providers (in the United States and/or other countries, including countries in which Allegion operates or as offices) to provide services for Allegion, such as payment processing and web hosting and other services required by law. Allegion uses third-party service providers to process personal data for service-related and administrative purposes. Such service providers are located in the United States and other locations where Allegion does business. When Allegion retains another company to perform a function of this nature, such third party will be required to protect the personal data and will not be authorized to use the personal data for any other purpose.

We have taken steps to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data, unauthorized or accidental access to personal data, and accidental or unlawful loss or destruction of personal data. However, we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction of personal data or any unlawful forms of processing.

Users should safeguard any password or user ID obtained for use on our Site and are responsible for any misuse or unauthorized use of our Site via their password and user ID maintaining the secrecy of their own passwords. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us using the contact information below.

We will retain your Personal Data for as long as we have a reasonable legal or commercial need for it, after which time we will destroy it through currently available secure destruction means.

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right, at any time, to access personal data that Allegion holds about you; to request that we stop using or disclosing your personal data; to request that we update, amend, or delete your personal data; and to withdraw any previously given consent with regard to your personal data; using the contact information below.
