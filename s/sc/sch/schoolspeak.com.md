Privacy Policy

| 

SchoolSpeak is committed to protecting its users' privacy. This Privacy Policy is intended to give users of the SchoolSpeak website(at [www.schoolspeak.com](http://www.schoolspeak.com/))("Website"), including teachers, administrators, students, parents, and third party vendors and contractors to whom the applicable school ("School") may grant access to perform services for the School (collectively, "Users"), a full understanding of the collection, use, disclosure, security, and User options regarding information collected at the Website.

**_Information We Collect_**  
   
  
All registered Users shall be given a User ID and password. Users must provide first and last name. User also may provide other basic User information such as mailing address, email address, parent's name, phone number, date of birth, emergency contact information, grade, and other personal information (collectively with first and last name, "PII"). If PII is provided by the student who is under 13 years of age, we protect such "Child Information" pursuant to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. We also may collect non-personally identifiable information ("NII") when Users use the Website, through the use of cookies, log files, clear gifs and/or other technologies. A cookie is a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters sent to the User's computer that identifies the User's web browser. Users can set their web browser to refuse cookies; however, if this is done, some Website features may not function properly or not at all. Log file information is automatically collected from a User's web browser each time a User views a Website webpage, and may include information such as IP address, browser type and language, domain names of websites visited, webpages viewed, the amount of time spent on a webpage, and date and time information. Clear gifs may be used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of Users. Clear gif, cookie, and log file information are NII because an individual User cannot be identified by use of the NII alone.

Users may also post text, photos, homework, calendar entries, School events, grades, assignments, and other files or materials to the Website ("User Submissions"), including to message boards or chat areas; however, the School has control over who can post and view User Submissions. User Submissions may contain PII.

We may collect and retain additional information in certain situations, for example, if a User submits to us a request for information or a service. Users also may be requested to provide information, which may or may not include PII, through surveys or feedback forms.

**_Child Protection_**  
   
  
We require parental consent in the form of a signed parental consent form before the School will gives access to any student User from whom information will be collected. Parental consent is received by the School, and the School is responsible for providing parent Users access to their child's profile so that the parent User may review, modify, or delete any Child Information contained in the profile by logging into their child's account on the Website.The School is responsible for confirming receipt of valid parental consent forms for each child before allowing the child to access the Website.

Parents always have the right to refuse further collection, use and/or disclosure of the Child Information by giving notice to the School. Parents also have the option to agree to the collection and use of their child's personal information without agreeing to the disclosure of the information to third parties by notifying the school; however, due to the nature of the Website, if parents do not consent to disclosure, their child will not have access to the Website. In any case, we may provide any collected information to third parties who use it solely to provide support for our internal operations.

Student Users will not be required to disclose more Child Information than is reasonably necessary to enable the child's participation in the Website features. This Child Information is not sold to any third parties and is only disclosed to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.

**_Use_**  
   
  
PII and User Submissions may be used to provide Users with a way to communicate and receive information and communications about their School (such as schedules and announcements) and students (such as grades, homework, parental permissions, and club membership). (See the SchoolSpeak Website for further information regarding the functionality of the Website). PII and User Submissions may be used by SchoolSpeak to improve and maintain the Website and related services. PII and User Submissions may be monitored by the School to ensure compliance with School policies and rules. We do not link NII and PII.

NII may be used anonymously for marketing or administrative purposes, to monitor system performance, to fix technical problems with the Website, and may be disclosed to third parties to assist in these efforts.

When Users send email or other communication using the Website, we may retain those communications in order to process inquiries, respond to requests and improve our services. Users specifically agree that SchoolSpeak and the School reserve the right to use User email addresses to send service, account, privacy and School related emails to Users. Users cannot opt-out of these communications unless they deactivate their account. We or the School may communicate with Users via email or phone to provide requested services. The School determines which Users can send email through the Website, which allows the selected Users to send email to other Users email addresses.

**_Disclosure_**  
   
  
SchoolSpeak and the School may provide collected information, including PII and NII to subsidiaries, contractors, partners and other third parties, who provide services to us or the School, such as information processing, email services, and administrative services. If SchoolSpeak discloses collected information to such third parties, the third party will have agreed to maintain the confidentiality and security of PII and to follow the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. The School or SchoolSpeak may disclose collected information to third parties, at its sole discretion, to (1) respond to a request or demand from a court, administrative body, law enforcement, the School, or government agency, (2) enforce the SchoolSpeak Terms and Conditions, (3) detect, prevent, investigate or remedy a potential violation of applicable law, School rules or policies, or the Terms and Conditions, and/or (3) protect Users and other third parties from harm to their rights, property or safety, or as otherwise required by law.

The School may decide to assign to Users varying viewing privileges. Based upon such designations, Users may have access to some or all School specific PII, including Child Information, grades, homework assignments, contact information, age, etc. The School decides who has access to what PII and User Submissions. School administrators and teacher may access, delete, or modify its student Users' PII. Once User Submissions are posted on the Website (for example, on message boards or chat rooms), they may accessible to various Users.

In the event SchoolSpeak is part of a merger, acquisition, asset sale, or bankruptcy, all collected information may be transferred to a third party. We will provide a prominent notice on our Website before such transfer occurs, if allowed by law.

The Website may contain links to third party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. If Users provide information to any third party websites, that information is subject to the third party privacy policy, not our Privacy Policy.

**_Security_**  
   
  
We take security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of collected information. The School assigns all Users access levels depending on their roles, i.e. teachers, students, administration, and parents. This is intended to ensure that a User only views the information that the User is allowed to according to rules set by the School. Access to the Website is protected by requiring a User ID and password. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information managed by the Website.   
  
   
**_Agreement and Changes_**  
   
  
Each User, by clicking the "I Accept" box, using the Website, or providing consent for the User's child to use the Website, agrees to the current Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions, to which this Privacy Policy is incorporated. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on the Website with a new Effective Date (see below). A notice and request for consent will be provided to parents if there are material changes to policies regarding the collection, use, or disclosure of Child Information or other PII. Any changes are effective upon posting.
