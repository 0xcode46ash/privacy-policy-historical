# Schoology.com | About Us

## Schoology's Privacy Statement

  * We at Schoology respect your privacy and take the issue of Internet privacy very seriously. By accepting the Schoology Terms of Service, you consent to the use and disclosure of personal information that you provide to us as outlined in this Privacy Statement. As Schoology improves its services, we may modify the Privacy Statement, and urge you to check here for updates from time to time.

This document specifies the following:

1\. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the web site  
2\. The organization collecting the information  
3\. How the information is used   
4\. With whom the information may be shared  
5\. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information  
6\. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Schoology control  
7\. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 

  * Schoology Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 
  * Schoology collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 
  * ### Registration Information

In order to use this website, both Schoology Clients and Schoology Experts must first complete the registration form. During registration we request users' contact information, such as name and email address. This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest, and is also used as the user's sign in information. It is optional for the user to provide additional personalized information (such as experience and qualifications) and unique identifiers (such as a screen name), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. During the Registration process, you have the ability to "opt-out" of receiving Schoology newsletters and promotions.   
Schoology hosts its own site (www.Schoology.com) as well as sites for Schoology partners (typically some variation of www.Schoology.com/partners/[partner name]). Schoology uses a similar registration process for users at our partner sites, and only Schoology stores personally identifiable information collected at these sites. Any questions arising from collection of information through the Schoology service at our partner sites should be directed to partners@Schoology.com.   

  * ### Services Through the Site

We request information from the user during the process of using the Schoology service. We break down users of our service into two categories, Clients and Experts (you may register as both a Client and an Expert). Clients must provide financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date in order to pay for and use the Schoology service. Experts must provide contact information, like name and mailing address, in order to receive their payment from Schoology. The information we collect from both Clients and Experts is to provide users with the best possible Schoology service. If we have trouble providing that service, we may use contact information to get in touch with the user. 
  * ### Client-Expert Communication Using the Schoology Service

The main purpose of Schoology is to allow registered Schoology Experts to provide Clients with services that the Clients need. Experts and Members can negotiate and enter into a contract for a service using the Schoology site. Certain communications may be recorded and maintained by Schoology. Schoology does not screen or edit the content of communications between Clients and Experts. Such communications are personal and private unless both parties agree to additional distribution, for example by posting questions or services on the Public Board (described later). Information that is relayed between the Client and the Expert during either the negotiation phase of their relationship or during the actual relaying of service is kept completely confidential, and no other users of Schoology have access to this information. 
  * ### Publicly Accessible Information

Schoology makes a Public Board available to its registered users. The Public Board allows Clients to post questions or service requests that can be viewed by any Expert. Clients can post requests anonymously if they wish. They also designate the length of time they wish to have their question remain "in view" on the public board. All postings, descriptions, etc. are public to registered Clients and Experts until a Client enters into a personal negotiation with an Expert, after the Expert has responded to the public question with an initial offer and the Client responds to the Expert. All subsequent communications between the Client and Expert, including both the negotiation phase and the actual relaying of service, are kept confidential. Schoology clearly denotes to its users which communications are visible to all registered users and those that are visible to a specific, individual user only. 
  * ### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to sign in his or her email and password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, he or she may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will have to sign in each time he or she visits the site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 
  * ### Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are also linked to personally identifiable information in order to better the user's experience when using our site. We may also retain any emails, letters, or other correspondence between you and Schoology to ensure quality control and the best possible service, although we have no obligation to do so. 
  * ### Use of Information Available Through Schoology

To ensure both Clients and Experts with the best service possible on our site, and to facilitate communication among Clients and Experts, Schoology provides email addresses to Clients and Experts only under specific circumstances, including but not necessarily limited to participants involved in disputed and unpaid transactions. By reviewing Schoology's Terms of Service and approving Schoology's Legal Agreement, registered users of Schoology agree to use the Public Board area and all communication facilities provided by Schoology exclusively for interaction associated with Schoology services and their delivery. Registered users may not use information gathered through a Schoology transaction to defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the legal and civil rights of any other registered user. Registered users may not use information gathered through a Schoology transaction to sell any goods or services for any commercial purpose outside the scope of the Schoology service. Email addresses and personal information may not be used to forward surveys contests, pyramid schemes or chain letters, or to post the same message repeatedly (a practice referred to as "spamming"). Schoology may terminate the ability of any Client or Expert to use the Schoology service. 

**PARENTS:** You should always supervise your children's use of the Internet. For information about commercially available products to assist you in filtering material that you may consider harmful to minors, please see http://worldvillage.com/wv/school/html/control.htm or other similar sites. 

  * ### Sharing

We currently do not share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers, but may do so in the future. This will not be linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We use a credit card processing company to bill users for use of the Schoology service. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. We reserve the right to partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 
  * ### Our Partners and Links to Other Sites

Schoology maintains sites for some of its partners. All sites are maintained on Schoology servers, and all personally identifiable information is stored solely by Schoology. We do record the Partner web site from which a visitor has linked to Schoology. If a visitor registers to become a Client and/or an Expert, Schoology may track the partner's name, in order to further the relationships Schoology has with its partners. This web site contains links to other sites, for example to download software that improves the user's Schoology experience. Please be aware that Schoology is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 
  * ### Tell-A-Friend

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Schoology will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Schoology stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact Schoology at support@Schoology.com to request the removal of this information from their database. 
  * ### Security We Provide

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted. We use the industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption and firewalls to protect against loss, misuse, and alteration of any personal data under our control. While on a secure page such as our registration form, there is a "locked" icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to security@Schoology.com. 
  * ### Correction/Updating Personal Information:

If a user's personally identifiable information, such as a mailing address, changes, or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the "My Schoology" page, the user's personal zone within Schoology, or by emailing our Customer Support at support@Schoology.com. 
  * ### Choice/Opt-out

Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for or send information. Our registration form has an 'opt-out' mechanism to allow for removal from newsletters, promotions, etc., and registered users can always choose to 'opt-out' by following the appropriate mechanism from within "My Schoology", their personal zone within Schoology. Users of our site will always be notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. 
  * ### Contacting Us
