# Schools Financial Credit Union | 1-916-569-5400

### Privacy Policy

Schools Financial Credit Union (“Credit Union”) understands the importance of protecting the privacy of our members. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of each member’s financial records consistent with state and federal laws. This policy explains how the Credit Union collects and shares your nonpublic personal information (information that is not available publicly) and further describes your rights to limit what information we may share about you. 

This privacy policy replaces any previous privacy notices from us. We reserve the right to revise our privacy notice as our business needs and practices change or as the law requires. If we revise our policies, we will provide our active members with copies of our new policies at that time. 

**What Information We Collect**  
During the course of business, we collect nonpublic personal information (“information”) about you from the following sources: 

  * Information obtained from you in person, in writing or through the Internet.
  * Information obtained through your transactions and experiences with us and our affiliates.
  * Information we receive from nonaffiliated third parties about their transactions and experiences with you.
  * Information provided by credit reporting agencies and similar companies.



We collect this information about you to complete your transactions and to maintain your accounts and related records. In the course of conducting our business, we may share any of the information we collect about you with third parties if: 1) you request or authorize it; 2) the information is provided to help complete a transaction initiated by you; 3) the information is provided to a third party providing services to us, such as data processing, printing services, mailing services and marketing services; 4) the information is provided to a consumer reporting agency in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act; or 5) the disclosure is otherwise lawfully required or permitted. Furthermore, we may also disclose information about you to other nonaffiliated and affiliated third parties not described in this notice as permitted by law. 

**Information Shared With Non-Financial Service Providers**   
We sometimes share any of the information we collect about you with outside companies that perform services for us. For example, to maintain and service your accounts or to fulfill your transaction requests, we share information with non-financial companies that provide services to us, such as data-processing companies, printing companies, mailing companies and marketing companies. Prior to sharing any information with such entities, we require them to agree to safeguard our members’ information and to comply with all applicable privacy laws. 

**Information Sharing in the Event of Termination of Membership**  
If you terminate your membership or become an inactive member, we will adhere to the privacy policies and practices as described in this notice. 

**How We Protect Your Information**  
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural controls that comply with federal regulations to guard your information. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need it in order to provide products and services to you. Where appropriate, we use security-encoding techniques to protect against unauthorized access to personal records, ensure accuracy and integrity of data and protect your confidentiality. We provide training to educate employees on the purpose and implementation of procedures related to privacy and the confidentiality of member data. 

**Changes to Our Policy**  
We reserve the right to revise our policy as our business needs change or as the law requires. If we revise our policies, we will provide our members with copies of our new policies at that time. 

**Restricting Credit Offers, Direct Mail and Telemarketing Solicitations**  
Businesses can obtain information about you from public records, such as those available at County Recorders. They may use this information to market their services and sometimes make reference to your Credit Union. Schools cannot control or restrict the use of publicly available information about you, and we do not authorize these businesses to use our name. However, there are steps you can take to minimize these and other types of direct mail solicitations. 

**Credit Solicitations**  
You may contact credit reporting agencies directly and ask that your name be removed from unsolicited credit offers. By doing this, you will no longer receive credit offers from credit card companies and financial institutions, including Schools. You may call 888-5OPT-OUT or write to:
