# Schrödinger - Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: April 29, 2010**

**Web Site Privacy Practices**

Schrödinger recognizes privacy and security as being a concern for most individuals accessing the Internet. This privacy policy describes the collection and use of personal information by Schrödinger, LLC (“Schrödinger” or “we”) on Schrodinger.com (this “Web Site”).

Please read this policy carefully before providing any personal information to this Web Site. Schrödinger reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any time by posting the changes on this Web Site. Your continued use of this Web Site constitutes your acceptance of the currently posted privacy policy.

**What information is collected?**

This Web Site collects personal information that visitors voluntarily provide to this Web Site. Typically, visitors provide personal information to this Web Site to request a service of Schrödinger. For example, visitors to this Web Site are asked to provide personal information, such as name, title, institution, address, email address and other contact information, when they request a sales quote for Schrödinger software, ask for a new logon account, register for a symposium, webinar, or campaign, or send Schrödinger an email message via any of the links on this Web Site. Visitors with a logon account are required to provide their email and password before they are permitted to access certain features, such as downloading Schrödinger software or consulting our support documentation. From time to time, visitors may also be invited to respond to an optional survey or questionnaire on this Web Site.

Information about your computer and Internet browser is also automatically collected by our web server and by third-party servers that provide website analytics services to Schrödinger. This information includes your IP address, domain name, browser type and version, operating system, access times and referring Web site address. We place “Web beacons” (also known as “clear gifs”) on our Web pages to help us collect this information. Schrödinger generally uses this information to measure the usage of this Web Site (such as the number of visitors, average time spent on the Web Site, and pages viewed), and to improve the Web Site’s content.

**What about cookies?**

Like most Web sites, our Web Site uses cookies to enable basic Web functions. Our Web Site cookies store information on the hard drive or in the memory of a visitor's computer. The cookies issued by our Web Site to a visitor’s browser allow us to compile usage statistics for this Web Site and keep track of user preferences for the Web Site. For visitors with a logon account, the information stored in the cookie also permits our Web Site to verify the visitor’s logon name and password, in order to enable access to the password-protected portions of the Web Site.

You have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is sent, or to reject all cookies. Please note, however, that if you choose to reject all cookies, this Web Site will have no means to verify your logon account, and you will not be able to use the password-protected areas of this Web Site.

**Who is collecting the information?**

When you provide personal information on this Web Site, you are submitting that information to Schrödinger.

**How is my information used?**

Schrödinger collects the personal information you submit in order to respond to your specific request, and to support Schrödinger software and its licensees and users. We use the information you provide to help us design new products and improve existing products, and to provide you with information, advice and purchase recommendations.

We may also use the information we collect to inform you of other products and services available from us, our corporate affiliates or business partners. You may receive a communication from us, our affiliate or business partner by email or direct mail. If you do not want to receive such information, simply follow the directions contained in each such communication to remove your name from our mailing list. You may also contact us at [remove@schrodinger.com](mailto:remove@schrodinger.com).

Finally, Schrödinger may research our users' demographics and interests based on the information provided to us. We do this to better understand and serve our users. Schrödinger may share this data with our business partners.

**With whom does Schrödinger share my information?**

Schrödinger shares your personal information with its corporate affiliates, in connection with the management and operation of Schrödinger’s business. Schrödinger may also share information provided by a visitor with our trusted third-party vendors to enable them to fulfill your request, or otherwise to provide services to Schrödinger that are consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

In addition, visitors who register online for Schrödinger’s symposia and webinars will have their personal contact information included on an attendee list that is shared with the event’s sponsors (if any), and possibly with other meeting attendees. Event attendees may therefore be contacted after the event by the event’s sponsors and others.

Schrödinger may also disclose personal information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Web Site’s Terms of Use or may be violating Schrödinger's or other's rights or causing injury to or interference with Schrödinger's or other's property. Schrödinger may also disclose or access personal information if required to do so by law or when we believe in good faith such action is necessary to comply with the law, respond to claims or comply with legal process served on Schrödinger. Personal information may be disclosed to a third party as part of a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information could be assigned or otherwise transferred to one or more third parties as one of the business assets of Schrödinger. Schrödinger may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Web Site to prospective business partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

**What choices do I have regarding collection, use and distribution of my information?**

If you do not want to receive email or direct mail from Schrödinger, simply follow the directions contained in each such communication to remove your name from our mailing list. You may also contact us at [remove@schrodinger.com](mailto:remove@schrodinger.com).

**What security measures does Schrödinger use to protect my information from loss, misuse or alteration?**

Certain pages on our Web Site use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology to encrypt the data submitted to our Web Site. The SSL protocol provides server authentication, data integrity, and privacy on the Web. Your web browser will usually indicate, with a “padlock” icon, or by a similar means, when the information that you are submitting to our Web Site is SSL-encrypted.

Whether or not it is encrypted, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Schrödinger cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our Web Site, and therefore you use our site at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we use our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

As a global company, Schrödinger has sites and users all over the world. When you give Schrödinger personal information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information. In addition, that information may be used, stored and processed outside of the country where you entered that information. Whenever Schrödinger handles personal information, regardless of where this occurs, it takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.

**How can I correct or change or view my personal information?**

If you would like to correct, change or view any personal information you have provided, please send e-mail to [personal@schrodinger.com](mailto:personal@schrodinger.com).

**What else should I know?**

This Web Site may contain links to various third-party Web sites. These sites may provide additional information, goods, services and/or promotions. These sites are owned and operated independently of Schrödinger and have their own separate privacy and data collection practices. Any information you provide to a third-party Web site will be governed by the terms (if any) of the privacy policy of such third-party Web site, and Schrödinger encourages you to review and understand the privacy practices of a third-party Web site before providing it with information. Schrödinger is not responsible for the content or policies of any third-party Web sites to which the Web site links. SCHRÖDINGER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR THE CONTENT OR POLICIES OF ANY THIRD-PARTY WEB SITES TO WHICH THE WEB SITE LINKS.
