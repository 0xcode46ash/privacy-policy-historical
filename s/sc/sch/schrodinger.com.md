**Web Site Privacy Practices**

Schrödinger recognizes privacy and security as being a concern for most individuals accessing the Internet. Whether you are buying one of our products, or just browsing our site, we want to make you comfortable with our privacy policy and the security measures we take to protect your personal information. 

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information by Schrödinger as set forth in the privacy practices currently in effect. Schrödinger will occasionally update these Privacy Practices to reflect company and customer feedback. Such changes will be posted here on the Web site, so please check back periodically to ensure you have the most current policy.

**What information is collected?**

Schrödinger collects personally identifiable information, including name, title, company, address, e-mail address, phone numbers, etc. when a visitor places an order with us.

We may ask you for personal information at times other than when you order, including, by way of example, when you complete surveys or other questionnaires, when you send an e-mail to Schrödinger, or when you request a logon account for our website. Wherever Schrödinger collects personal information we try to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.

There is also information about your computer that may be automatically collected by our web server. This could include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is aggregated to measure number of visits, average time spent on a Schrödinger Web site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our sites and to improve the content of our sites.

**Who is collecting the information?**

When you are on a Schrödinger site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Schrödinger.

The Schrödinger Web site may contain links to various third-party Web sites. These sites may provide additional information, goods, services and/or promotions. These sites are owned and operated independently of Schrödinger and have their own separate privacy and data collection practices. Any information you provide to a third-party Web site will be governed by the terms (if any) of the privacy policy of such third-party Web site, and Schrödinger encourages you to review and understand the privacy practices of a third-party Web site before providing it with information.. Schrödinger is not responsible for the content or policies of any third-party Web sites to which the Schrödinger Web site links. Schrödinger EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR THE CONTENT OR POLICIES OF ANY THIRD-PARTY WEB SITES TO WHICH THE Schrödinger WEB SITE LINKS.

**How is my information used?**

Schrödinger's primary goal in collecting personal information is to facilitate order processing and to enable us to contact you if a problem arises with your order. Providing such information when making a purchase is required. 

The Schrödinger site may also contain optional surveys and questionnaires asking for information. We use the information you provide to help us design new products and improve existing products, and to provide you with advice and purchase recommendations. 

We also use the information we collect to help target valuable marketing and advertising offers and to inform you of other products and services available from us or our affiliates. This kind of advertising may be done with promotional e-mails sent by Schrödinger, or by other means such as snail mail. If you do not want to receive such information, simply follow the directions contained in each such communication to remove your name from our mailing list. You may also contact us at [remove@schrodinger.com](mailto:remove@schrodinger.com).

Finally, Schrödinger does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us when making a purchase, during a promotion, from surveys and from our server log files. We do this to better understand and serve our users. Schrödinger may share this data with our business partners.

**With whom does Schrödinger share my information?**

Except as outlined in this policy or on our Web site, Schrödinger never provides your personal information to third parties without your consent. Schrödinger may share information you provide with trusted third-party business partners so that they may provide services to Schrödinger that are consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy, and this Web site. Such partners are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services for Schrödinger, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

Schrödinger may also disclose personal information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating this site's Terms of Use or may be violating Schrödinger's or other's rights or causing injury to or interference with Schrödinger's or other's property. Schrödinger may also disclose or access personal information if required to do so by law or when we believe in good faith such action is necessary to comply with the law, respond to claims or comply with legal process served on Schrödinger. Personal information may be disclosed to a third party as part of a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information could be assigned or otherwise transferred to one or more third parties as one of the business assets of Schrödinger. Schrödinger may match user information with third party data to help us better understand our customers. Schrödinger may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Web site to prospective business partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

Schrödinger does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.

**What choices do I have regarding collection, use and distribution of my information?**

Schrödinger or its business partners may, from time to time, send you e-mail or direct mail regarding our products and services. If you do not want to receive such information, simply follow the directions contained in each such communication to remove your name from our mailing list. You may also contact us at [remove@schrodinger.com](mailto:remove@schrodinger.com).

**What security measures does Schrödinger use to protect my information from loss, misuse or alteration?**

When you place an order or provide personal information, your transactions are encrypted for security. Encryption scrambles the information in your purchase, including your credit card number, so this information can only be viewed by Schrödinger. 

Schrödinger uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology, the highest level of security on the Internet. The SSL protocol provides server authentication, data integrity, and privacy on the Web. This security measure helps ensure that no impostors, eavesdroppers, or vandals get your personal information. SSL not only encrypts your personal and financial information transmitted, including credit card information, but also verifies the identity of the server and that the original message arrives safely at its destination.

However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Schrödinger cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our Web site, and therefore you use our site at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we use our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 

As a global company, Schrödinger has sites and users all over the world. When you give Schrödinger personal information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information. In addition, that information may be used, stored and processed outside of the country where you entered that information. Whenever Schrödinger handles personal information, regardless of where this occurs, it takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. 

**How can I correct or change or view my personal information?**

If you would like to correct, change or view any personal information you have provided, please send e-mail to [personal@schrodinger.com](mailto:personal@schrodinger.com).
