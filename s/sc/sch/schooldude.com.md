# About - SchoolDude Privacy Policy

Our policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. Our goal is to provide a "buyer centric" service to our members. This means we strive to represent the best interest of our members rather than the suppliers and advertisers that would like to sell products and services to our members. We will not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about our customers to any third party without first receiving that user's permission. 

**Does SchoolDude ask for personal information?**

Yes, we do. SchoolDude may ask for your name, email address, and other personal information when you sign up for our services. We may also ask for such information at other times, such as when you request information from SchoolDude. 

**Will SchoolDude disclose any of my personal information?**

SchoolDude will not disclose any of your personal information, except as described below, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or property of SchoolDude. Under confidentiality agreements, SchoolDude may match user information with third party data. 

SchoolDude does disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. If/when we do match user information, we endeavor to keep personal information confidential from those third parties. 

Additionally, if you make a purchase from our site, the information obtained during your visit to these areas, and the information that you give such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to the merchant of record. These merchants can be SchoolDude or third party companies. These merchants have separate privacy and data collection practices. SchoolDude has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. 

**How does SchoolDude use my personal information?**

SchoolDude's goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with the most personalized web experience possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a little about you, SchoolDude is able to deliver more relevant content, and hence better service, to you.

**Will SchoolDude use my information for direct or email mailings?**

We will send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. You can remove yourself from this distribution list via a link in the communication. Only SchoolDude (or agents working on behalf of SchoolDude and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. 

**Does SchoolDude use cookies and "IP Addresses"?**

Yes, cookies are used on SchoolDude in various ways.

  1. We use cookies to be reminded of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register.
  2. Cookies are also used to estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing SchoolDude is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine repeat usage versus initial usage.



**IP Addresses**

SchoolDude collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and security only. 

**What else should I know about my privacy?**

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example in discussion forums, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 

Furthermore, while we strive to protect your personal information, SchoolDude cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In addition, SchoolDude partners and third party Internet sites and services accessible through SchoolDude or parties whom we inform you are collecting data in connection with sweepstakes, promotions, etc., have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. SchoolDude has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions. 

**The point?** You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. 

**We use Google Analytics** to conduct anonymous web traffic analysis for our site. While Google Analytics makes use of cookies, no personal information is ever collected or analyzed by this service. 

**Our policy on Discussion Messages and Posts**

The content of these messages and posts are not necessarily those shared by SchoolDude.com, Inc. These opinions are expressly those of the online community members and their guests. SchoolDude.com makes no claims to agree with or disagree with the opinions expressed online. SchoolDude.com will make every attempt to maintain decorum at its discretion and will remove visitors' posts if they are deemed to be unacceptable.
