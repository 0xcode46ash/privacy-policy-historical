# Scholarship Experts - Privacy

---  
  
**Use of Personal Data**

Scholarship Experts knows that privacy matters, especially in this information age and the Internet era. We have, therefore, created a website and a scholarship search service that puts the protection of your privacy as our number one priority. We make every effort to maintain your confidentiality and keep your trust. Read on to learn how dedicated we are to keeping your personal information private!  
  
**Information Collection and Use**

Recognizing the fact that matching students with potential scholarships requires the collection of very personal information, Scholarship Experts has placed specific limitations on the collection of and use of your personal data. 

We will collect and store your personal information in order to deliver highly accurate and filtered scholarship search results to you. Matching you with scholarships for which you are potentially eligible cannot happen without this collection and storage of personal data. 

We will **NOT** , however, use that personal data for purposes beyond those just described as necessary to the scholarship search process. We will NOT resell, distribute, or share your personal data with third parties. Scholarship Experts is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.   
  
  
**Registration**

In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration process. During registration, a user is required to give their contact information (first and last names, email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest.   
  
**E-Profile**

It is also necessary for the user to provide additional personal data throughout the site while completing the E-Profile as the E-Profile allows Scholarship Experts to customize and personalize search results for our users. Personal information (such as income level, religious preference, gender, etc.) and unique identifiers (such as date of birth), is collected so we can provide our scholarship search service and produce accurate, filtered results.  
  
**Transactions/Ordering**

We request information from the user on our transaction page. A user must provide contact information (like name and address for address verification purposes) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes. If we have trouble processing an order, the user's contact information is also used to get in touch with the user.  
  
**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Scholarship Experts does not use cookies, nor do we have plans to implement such technology in the future. 

Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.  
  
  
**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.  
  
**Sharing**

We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We use a credit card processing company to bill users for services. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.  
  
  
**Links**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Scholarship Experts, are not responsible for the accuracy or the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.  
  
  
**Surveys and Contests**

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.   
  
**Tell-A-Friend**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Scholarship Experts will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Scholarship Experts stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact Scholarship Experts at [info@scholarshipexperts.com](mailto:info@scholarshipexperts.com) to request the removal of this information from their database.  
  
  
**Security**

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, that information is protected both online and off-line. 

We use the latest firewall technology and a secure transaction page to protect sensitive information online. Because our site requires electronic, credit card transactions, we have taken steps to ensure that your credit card transactions will be secure. All of the customer information we gather is protected against unauthorized access. No third parties have access to your private data. 

We also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment with limited key-only access. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [security@scholarshipexperts.com](mailto:security@scholarshipexperts.com).  
  
  
**Emails for Site and Service Updates**

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email.  
  
  
**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done by updating your E-Profile on the website or by emailing Customer Support at [info@scholarshipexperts.com](mailto:info@scholarshipexperts.com). Because we want to protect from the loss, misuse and/or alteration of the information under our control, we have authorized only you to update your profile. Please respect this security measure and refrain from sharing your password information to another party.  
  
  
**Note to Parents and Children under 13**

Scholarship Experts will not knowingly collect any personal information from or allow the registration of students under the age of 13. Parents should monitor and be involved with their child's Internet usage to prevent them from disclosing personal information or from accessing inappropriate sites.  
  
  
**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. This privacy policy contains the following information:

  1. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the web site 
  2. The organization collecting the information
  3. How the information is used 
  4. With whom the information may be shared 
  5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information 
  6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Scholarship Experts control
  7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 



If you feel that we are not abiding by this posted privacy policy, you should contact the operations department of Scholarship Experts by sending an email to [security@scholarshipexperts.com](mailto:security@scholarshipexperts.com).
