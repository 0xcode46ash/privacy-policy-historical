# Scholarship Experts!

**Use of Personal Data**   
Scholarship Experts knows that privacy matters, especially in this information age and the Internet era. We have, therefore, created a website and a scholarship search service that puts the protection of your privacy as our number one priority. We make every effort to maintain your confidentiality and keep your trust. Read on to learn how dedicated we are to keeping your personal information private! 

**Information Collection and Use**   
Recognizing the fact that matching students with potential scholarships requires the collection of very personal information, Scholarship Experts has placed specific limitations on the collection of and use of your personal data. 

We will collect and store your personal information in order to deliver highly accurate and filtered scholarship search results to you. Matching you with scholarships for which you are potentially eligible cannot happen without this collection and storage of personal data. 

We will NOT, however, use that personal data for purposes beyond those just described as necessary to the scholarship search process. We will NOT resell, distribute, or share your personal data with third parties. Scholarship Experts is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. 

**Registration**   
In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration process. During registration, a user is required to give their contact information (first and last names, email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. 

**E-Profile**   
It is also necessary for the user to provide additional personal data throughout the site while completing the E-Profile as the E-Profile allows Scholarship Experts to customize and personalize search results for our users. Personal information (such as income level, religious preference, gender, etc.) and unique identifiers (such as date of birth), is collected so we can provide our scholarship search service and produce accurate, filtered results. 

**Transactions/Ordering  
**We request information from the user on our transaction page. A user must provide contact information (like name and address for address verification purposes) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes. If we have trouble processing an order, the user's contact information is also used to get in touch with the user.

**Cookies  
**A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Scholarship Experts does not use cookies, nor do we have plans to implement such technology in the future. 

Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

**Log Files**   
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**  
We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We use a credit card processing company to bill users for services. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Links**   
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Scholarship Experts, are not responsible for the accuracy or the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.
