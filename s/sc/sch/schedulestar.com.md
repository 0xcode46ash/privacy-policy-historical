# BIGTEAMS PRIVACY POLICY

                                 BIGTEAM S PRIVACY POLICY
BIGTEAMS, LLC (“BigTeams”) provides athletic/activity/scheduling website management service to
schools, leagues, booster clubs, and athletic clubs, including through the websites located at
www.bigteams.com and www.schedulestar.com.
This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) is to explain what information about you we collect, how we use it and
how we share it. We provide a link to this Policy wherever it applies, such as on our Station web sites,
our mobile apps, our social networking presence on Facebook and other platforms, and other online
services that we provide and control (“Services”). By using our Services, you accept our practices as
described in this Policy.
This Policy is incorporated by reference into the BigTeams Terms of Use (“TOU”) [LINK TO TOU at
www.bigteams.com and www.schedulestar.com], which also governs your use of our Services.
TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT
We collect and use the information that you voluntarily submit to us via our Services. We also may
collect information about how you use the Services, like when you visit our web sites and how you
interact with our content.
The information we collect includes personal information, which personally identifies you, such as your
name, email address or billing information, or other data that we can reasonably link to such information.
We may require certain types of personal information in order to provide a particular Service, such as an
email address in order to deliver news updates or a mobile number in order to let you know by text that
you won a contest. We also collect non-personal information, which does not identify a particular person.
We may collect personal information about other people when you submit it to us, such as by
participating in a promotion or contest or when you submit news stories or nominations to us. By
providing us with the personal information of others, you represent that you have the legal right to do so.
We collect information automatically about your use of our Services, as well as the devices and software
you use to access our Services. Like most online operators, we use cookies, web beacons and other
similar technology to collect information automatically, in order to deliver the Services, tailor your
experience, monitor how our Services are used, improve them, deliver customized advertising, and for
other purposes. You may configure your browser to reject cookies, but doing so could make it difficult to
use and enjoy our Services. We will continue to add new technology to our Services, which may collect
information about you and your use of our Services.
When you visit any BigTeams website, we may collect tracking information such as your browser type,
the type of operating system you use, and pages you visited on our sites. None of this information
identifies you personally; we use this information to make our sites more useable to you, your league and
your schools.
We use “cookies” in a very limited way in order to store user information. A cookie is a small amount of
data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie
contains a unique number that allows our site to recognize your computer. The help function on most
browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to
disable cookies entirely. However, if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to use some of the
functions of the website.

HOW WE USE INFORMATION
Provide Services
Your information will be accessible to BigTeams staff and school administrators who may choose to
allow booster club members access to some personally identifiable information in order to, for example,
fill orders from the online store. Merchant account providers that handle credit card transactions will also
have some access to personally identifiable information. This is necessary to fill orders from the online
store. Please contact us for more information about your school’s merchant account provider. These
merchant account providers have their own privacy policies.
Disclosures
BigTeams may disclose information about you and your use of the Web Site and the BigTeams Services
if BigTeams believes such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with the law or legal process;
(ii) to protect or defend the rights or property of BigTeams or others; (iii) to enforce the BigTeams TOU
or this Policy; and (iv) to respond to claims that the content(s) of a communication violates the rights of
another. In addition BigTeams may share or transfer information about you and that you provide to
BigTeams, to one or more third party entities pursuant to a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture or
other transfer or disposition of a portion, or all of, the assets or stock of BigTeams or its affiliated entities,
or as otherwise provided herein.
Reports
We periodically prepare analyses and reports reflecting visitor and member use of the Web Site and
BigTeams Services for our internal use as well as for a limited number of our business partners. These
reports include aggregate (non-personal) information about BigTeams members, and in certain instances,
visitors to the Web Site. The information in these reports will not identify you individually. Our business
partners who have access to these reports will not be able to contact you from the information contained
in the reports.
THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ
cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising
effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely
anonymous.
Most advertisements you see on the Web Site are served to your web browser by BigTeams. However,
BigTeams allows other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Web Site or
through BigTeams Services. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology
vendors and research firms. We only authorize our third-party ad networks to employ anonymous
cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we
give them access to, any personally identifying information about you. BigTeams also limits the type of
ads delivered by these ad networks so that they are appropriate for children.
Third Party advertising networks may use information (not including your name, address, email address
or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements
about goods and services of interest to you.
BigTeams may also include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by
BigTeams to assist with auditing, research and reporting for advertisers.

BigTeams Privacy Policy
WR 6/2014


Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s
servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page
from their site. If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your
computer, currently you must visit each ad network’s web site individually and opt out (if they offer this
capability). Please contact us if you would like additional information regarding the specific third-party
ad networks used on the Web Site.
California Residents
If you reside in California and have an established business relationship with us, you may have the right
to receive information about how we share your personal information with our affiliates or third parties,
such as our advertisers. If you wish to learn about our practices, please send a written request to the
contact information identified below at the end of the Policy, including your full name, street address,
city, state and zip code; the name of the Service about which you are requesting information; and a
statement that your request is pursuant to the California “Shine the Light” Act. BigTeams is not able to
provide information about how companies outside Big Teams might use or disclose your information.
Security
BigTeams takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users’ information. When you submit
information via our service, your information is protected both online and off-line. We have physical,
electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you. However, we cannot
guarantee that communications between you and BigTeams will not be intercepted by others and that
information stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access. While we have taken reasonable
precautions to protect this information, you should always use discretion in what information you send to
us and not expect that such information will be absolutely free from intrusion. If you have any questions
about the security of our service, please contact us.
Children
BigTeams is committed to the safety of children. Children under the age of 13 may not register or
participate in any of the BigTeams Services. If children under 18 elect to register in any of the BigTeams
Services, they should ask a parent for permission before sending any information to the Web Site. We
will not request or knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from a child under 13. We
offer our Services to individuals who are at least 18 years old. We do not knowingly collect personal
information online from children under 13 years of age. If we discover that we have inadvertently
collected personal information online from children under the age of 13, we will endeavor promptly to
destroy or remove any identifying details.
Links
You should be aware that when you are on the Web Site or when you receive emails sent as part of
BigTeams Services, you could be directed to other sites beyond our control, and beyond the
school/booster club’s control. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use
the Web Site’s logo. These other web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data
or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.
Notification of Changes and Your Acceptance of the Policy
By using this Web Site, you signify your agreement to the terms of this Policy and the TOU. If there are
material changes to our Policy or if we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner
different from that stated when it was collected, we will post a link to our revised Policy on our home
page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Your continued use of this Web Site shall constitute your
acceptance of any revised Policy. We may change this Policy from time to time. We will post any
changes to this page, and if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. We will
