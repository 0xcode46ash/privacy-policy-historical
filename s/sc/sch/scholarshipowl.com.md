### Owl Marketing - Privacy Policy

Last updated: December 1, 2014

Owl Marketing Ltd. (“we”) respect the privacy of its customers and visitors (“you”) and are committed to maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of personal data we collect. **By visiting our website and/or using our services, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy**. 

#### 1 - Information We Collect

The information we learn from our customers and visitors helps us to facilitate scholarship applications on behalf of our customers. It also helps to personalize and continually improve our services to you. We collect information in the following ways: 

**1.1** Information You Give Us. We collect any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way (via chat, telephone calls, emails, online forms, etc.). This information may include identifying information such as name, address, phone number, email address and information on services ordered. You are required to supply correct information; otherwise, the application we will submit on your behalf may be unsuccessful or discarded, and there are scenarios where data submitted cannot be corrected later. We may also collect other essential information required to apply to scholarships, such as essays, scholastic information, and information regarding your education and interests. We may ask you to provide your credit card or other financial account information to enable us to charge your account when you purchase services from us. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of some of the features in our website or in the services we provide. 

**1.2** Automatic Information. We may collect certain types of information whenever you interact with us. This information may include IP address, email address, hardware settings, browser type, system crashes, time and duration of connection, run time information about the state of your virtual machine for example: uptime, CPU, network and disk utilization (R/W), etc. 

**1.3** Cookies. We may use cookies to keep track of your activities on our website. We also use them to recognize return visitors and to track our promotions. You may disable cookies in your browser, however, please note, that this may hinder your use of our website and the services we provide. 

#### 2 - How We Use Collected Information

**2.1** General. All information collected by us is used only for enabling and improving the services provided by us, including for applying to scholarships on behalf of our customers. 

**2.2** Promotional Use. In some instances, we may use your personal information to contact you via email to deliver promotional or informational materials in which you may find interest, as well as to deliver any updates or newsletters you may register to receive. You may choose to unsubscribe from our email notifications and newsletters at any time by sending us an email to [unsubscribe@scholarshipowl.com](mailto:unsubscribe@scholarshipowl.com). 

**2.3** Remarketing. We may remarket your information. Remarketing is a way for us to connect with users and communicate our services to you, based upon your past interactions with our website. Third-party marketing vendors may be hired by us to perform remarketing services. As a result, third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites on the internet. This allows us to make special offers and continue to market our services to those who have shown interest in our services. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our website. These cookies do not in any way identify you or give access to your computer. You can opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the [Ads Preferences Manager](https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/). In addition, you can opt out of other third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) opt-out page. To find out more about how Google uses any data it collects please visit [Google Privacy & Principals](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

**2.4** Owl Marketing Email. When you sign up for our services, we create a dedicated email address on behalf of scholarshipowl.com. When we apply to third party services providers such as scholarship providers and other relevant service providers on your behalf, we will use your Owl Marketing email address, and not your personal email address. Through this measure we aim to protect your personal information and avoid solicitation via third parties to your personal email address. 

#### 3 - Disclosure of Collected Information

As we respect your privacy, we will not otherwise disclose your personal or other information without your consent, except (i) to third party service providers in connection with the provision of the services to you, such as scholarship providers, tutoring and essay writers, providers of college placement services, and providers of student loans, (ii) to our subcontractors and other agents in connection with the provision of services to you, (iii) to third parties involved in processing payments for the services we provide, (iv) as required by law, court order or as requested by other government or law enforcement authorities, (v) to an acquirer of Owl Marketing Ltd. or of all or part of its business activity, in which case such acquirer will be permitted to obtain and use such information subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy, (vi) where we deem it necessary to protect the safety of any third party or to prevent violation of our rights or the rights of any third party, including the detection, preventing or otherwise addressing fraud, security or technical issues, or (vii) as described in this Privacy Policy or to enforce the provisions of this Privacy Policy. 

#### 4 - Information Security

We implement industry-standard security measures designed to prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the personal information we collect, including encryption, firewalls, and access controls. 

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations. 

Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected by us in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee absolute security. You understand and agree that all information collected through the website is at your own risk and is subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy. 

#### 5 Safe Harbor

As part of our commitment to protecting your privacy, we have elected to adhere to the [Safe Harbor Privacy Principles](http://export.gov/safeharbor/eg_main_018237.asp) of the United States Department of Commerce with respect to personal data collected by us directly from residents of the European Union and Switzerland.

#### 6 - Data Integrity

Personal data we collect is relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. We take reasonable steps to ensure that data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. 

#### 7 - Verification

We utilize the self-assessment approach to assure its compliance with this Privacy Policy. We regularly verify that the Privacy Policy is accurate, comprehensive, prominently displayed, completely implemented and in conformity with the Safe Harbor Principles and conduct our self-assessment on an annual basis to ensure that all relevant privacy practices are being followed. Appropriate employee training is in place and internal procedures for periodically conducting objective reviews of compliance are in place. A statement verifying this self-assessment is signed by a corporate officer or other authorized representative at least once a year.

We have agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) to resolve disputes pursuant to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, as well as to cooperate and comply with the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) of Switzerland.
