**How We Respond to Browser "Do Not Track" Signals** Some Web browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" feature that signals to websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Each browser communicates "Do Not Track" signals to the actual website differently making it unworkable to honor each and every request correctly. To alleviate any communication error between browsers and website, we do not respond to Web browser "Do Not Track" signals at this time. As the technology and communication between browser and website improves, we will reevaluate the ability to honor "Do Not Track" signals and may make changes to our policy. 

**Third Party Tracking** We permit third parties that we have agreements with to track you when you are on our website. When you leave our website there is a chance that these third parties may continue to track you. 

**Cookies:** Edvisors uses "cookies" and other technologies to help us learn more about how our users use our sites and to recognize you when you return. Cookies are text files that are placed in your computer's browser by a Web page server, and that can be used to help recognize you as an Edvisors user.

Cookies may store user preferences and other information, and can be deleted or blocked by changing the settings on your Web browser. You may also be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.

**Analytics Tools and Third Party Cookies:** Edvisors uses temporary cookies to help us determine how people travel through our site. A temporary cookie expires when you close your browser. This website also uses third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) to collect information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use this information only to improve this site. Such tools use permanent cookies to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Edvisors. Third-parties providing such analytics tools may also transfer this information to other third-parties where required to do so by law, or where such third-parties process the information on their behalf.

**Online Advertising Networks and Third Party Cookies:** Edvisors sometimes runs online ad campaigns that display Edvisors ads to you based on your likely interests. We may learn your likely interests when you use our websites and from other companies and websites that help us understand your likely interests. These types of ads are often called "interest-based ads" or "online behavioral advertising." We hire "ad networks" to display these ads on websites across the Internet.

The ad networks we hire to display these ads set their own cookies on your browser and use web beacons to measure the effectiveness of these ads and to understand your likely interests. Our ad networks and Edvisors both learn which Edvisors ads are shown to you, which ads are clicked on, and on which web page the ads were displayed.
