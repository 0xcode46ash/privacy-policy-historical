# Data Privacy Statement | Schneider Electric UK

##### **If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), Schneider Electric also complies with GDPR- specific requirements, including those relating to legal grounds for processing, cross-border data transfers, automated decision making and profiling, data retention, additional rights, claims and DPO contact details.**

**11.1 On what legal ground is Schneider Electric relying to use personal information?**

The use of personal information is necessary, with respect to the purposes mentioned in section 4 above:

\- To perform the contract concluded between Schneider Electric and customers or users in the context of the use of our products, services or digital content. The execution of the contract includes being able to identify individuals within a customer company or users. It includes, addressing requests for information, support, managing accounts and enrollment into our programs and ensuring compliance with terms and conditions and with this Privacy Policy.

\- To comply with legal obligations to which we are subject. For instance, mandatory tax and accounting obligations or addressing filing obligations and requests by competent regulatory bodies and authorities.

\- To carry out surveys in our legitimate interest as they are used for measuring customers and users’ satisfaction with Schneider Electric offers.

\- To send marketing communications and interest-based advertising based on consent previously obtained where applicable by law.

\- To provide an experience customized to the users’ location, with consent where applicable by law.

We may also process personal information for the purposes of our legitimate interests provided that such processing shall not outweigh individuals’ rights and freedoms, in particular:

\- To protect you, us or others from threats (such as security threats or fraud)

\- To comply with the laws that are applicable to us around the world

\- To improve our products, services and digital content

\- To perform profiling to provide targeted content and interest-based advertising

\- To share information between Schneider Electric subsidiaries and service providers as described in section 7

\- To understand and improve our online activities, our business, our customer base and relationships generally

\- To enable or administer our business, such as for quality control and consolidated reporting

\- To manage corporate transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions

**11.2 Will personal information be transferred abroad?**

At Schneider Electric, a global company, the teams working on fulfilling the data processing purposes may have global or multi-country roles. They can then be located anywhere in the world where [Schneider Electric operates](https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/locator/?locale=WW_en30&type=map&poco=all&locator=offices&header=se&mxdi=500), including outside the European Union, in countries which do not have equivalent standards for the protection of personal information as the country where you are located. We may also transfer data to service providers located outside of the EU, including in the United States of America. In the event that these data transfers cannot claim an adequacy decision by the European Commission, Schneider Electric will ensure that they comply with applicable legal requirements, for example by executing standard contractual clauses or through its Binding Corporate Rules for intragroup transfers as a data controller. To obtain more details on these transfers and, where appropriate, copies of the applicable safeguards implemented, you may contact: Global-Data-Privacy@schneider-electric.com

**11.3 Do we use profiling and make automated decisions about individuals?**

We may use profiling to provide you with online content which we believe corresponds to your interests. We combine registration information, such as work specialty and information about online activity to know you better, and provide you with online content corresponding to your profile.

We will not make automated-decisions about you that may significantly affect you, unless:

\- the decision is necessary as part of a contract;

\- we have your explicit consent;

\- or we are required by law to use the technology.

In these cases, due notice will be provided.

**11.4 How long will personal information be retained?**

We will retain personal information for as long as the information is needed for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy and for any additional period that may be required or permitted by law.   
More precise information is provided in privacy notices applicable to specific digital content. In general data retention periods are determined taking into consideration:

\- The duration of our relationship (e.g. contract performance duration, account de-activation, your legitimate need to be recognized when contacted by us)

\- Legal requirements for keeping data

\- Statute of limitations

For marketing purposes, we keep relevant customer data for three years after the end of our relationship or since the last interaction with us.

**11.5 What are your additional rights?**

In addition to the rights provided in section 10 above, you may ask us to erase, restrict or port your personal information and object to the use of your personal information. When data processing is based on individual consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by sending a request to the following email address:   
Global-Data-Privacy@schneider-electric.com   
For processing necessary to perform the contract, or based on legitimate interest, we may not be able to accommodate the request to stop the processing, or if we do so, it may mean that you can no longer access the services or the digital content.
