**PRIVACY POLICY**

SchoolNet Inc. (“SchoolNet”) takes your privacy very seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about SchoolNet’s Privacy Policy (“Policy”).  This Policy details how SchoolNet receives, collects and uses information in connection with its website located at SchoolNet.com (“Site”).  

**Collection and Use of Information**

SchoolNet collects and stores information from you in several ways on different parts of the Site.

_Information You Provide:_  

When you register on the Site, you will be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information, which may include your name, email address, address, telephone number(s), login name, login password and other self-identifying information (all “Personal Information”), as well as certain other information, such as age, gender and areas of interest. SchoolNet may also collect information which you provide in connection with surveys or for sweepstakes and contests on the Site, and information about the searches you perform, promotional offers you choose and the pages you visit on the Site. SchoolNet collects Personal Information primarily for the following purposes: (i) to maintain a record of registered users; (ii) to manage the login process, maintain users’ personal preferences, and provide service announcements and administrative messages; and (iii) to email registered users with news, updates and promotional offers.

SchoolNet may make certain message boards, forums and other social networking capabilities (such as joining “groups,” adding “colleagues,” and posting blogs) available to you on the Site (collectively, “Forums”). You are solely responsible for the information and other content you include in your profile, post or otherwise make available on and through these Forums, and any other activities you engage in, on or through the Site. In general, unless a group or activity is clearly and specifically marked as “PRIVATE,” you should assume that your membership in the group, participation in the activity and any information you provide or post through the Forums may be generally available and made known to all other registered users of the Site. Unless you choose to hide your real name by checking the applicable box in your profile, all such information may be made known to other users under your real name. You should also be aware that when you voluntarily disclose Personal Information (such as your email address or phone number) on or through these Forums, such information is generally accessible to and may be collected and used by other users. SchoolNet does not exercise control over any users or Site visitors, and is in no way responsible, and has not liability whatsoever, for any collection or use of information you may disclose through the Forums. This Privacy Policy will not cover such disclosure of information. You are encouraged to exercise discretion when providing personal or other information about yourself in and through Forums.

_**Information We Automatically Collect:**_

SchoolNet does not automatically collect any Personal Information.  SchoolNet may use cookies on the Site. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier by saving preferences and browsing patterns while you are at SchoolNet’s Site.  Cookies may be used to analyze Site usage, improve content, customize the Site’s content and layout and for other customer service purposes.  SchoolNet’s use of cookies is in no way linked to any Personal Information.  

SchoolNet may automatically receive and record certain non-personally identifiable information on its server logs from your browser, including your IP address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), cookie information, and the webpage that a user visits.  SchoolNet collects non-personally identifiable information for general purposes, including but not limited to analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking user movements, conducting research, and providing anonymous reporting to internal and external clients.  SchoolNet will not link any Personal Information, including e-mail addresses, with aggregate data of its users.

**Sharing and Disclosure of Information**

SchoolNet does not rent, sell, or share any information about the user with any third-parties.  SchoolNet may disclose your Personal Information if SchoolNet believes such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on SchoolNet; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of SchoolNet (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of SchoolNet services or members of the public. 

SchoolNet may share aggregated demographic information about users with third party advertising and content companies.  This information does not identify individual users and SchoolNet does not link aggregate user data with Personal Information. 

**Our Use of Your Personal Information**

We may use your Personal Information to send to you email announcements and other communications, including newsletters, promotional information and news and information about activities in your groups and among your colleagues. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you with options to discontinue receiving such promotional and newsletter emails, which you may do by following the instructions in any such email you receive from us. 

In addition, we will occasionally need to use your Personal Information to communicate with you by email in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, to manage your account and to inform you of service or other changes related to our Site operations. You will continue to receive such service announcements and responses to your inquiries even if you opt out of receiving our promotional and newsletter emails.  

**Editing and Deleting Your Personal Information**

You can edit your Personal Information at any time by visiting your user profile page when you log in to the Site.  In order to delete your Personal Information, please contact the Privacy Policy Administrator at the address below.

**Children’s Privacy**  

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.  We operate our website in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We never knowingly collect or maintain information at or on our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is directed at or structured to attract anyone under 13. Visitors younger than 13 years of age may NOT use the Site and software and must LEAVE immediately.

**Security**

SchoolNet takes reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information from misuse, loss and unauthorized access.  Although SchoolNet cannot guarantee that Personal Information will not be subject to unauthorized access, SchoolNet has physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the Personal Information.  Personal Information is protected by secured networks and access is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. 

**Business Transitions**

In the event that SchoolNet goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.  SchoolNet will post a notice on this website of any such change in ownership or control of the Personal Information SchoolNet may have prior to such transfer.

**Changes to Policy**

 From time to time, SchoolNet may revise this Policy.  SchoolNet will post the revised Policy on the Site, so that users can always be aware of what information SchoolNet collects, how the information is used and under what circumstances such information may be disclosed.
