At Scholarships.com, your privacy is important to us.

Scholarships.com maintains high standards for the protection of your privacy over the Internet. Scholarships.com has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and to explain the types of information we obtain about visitors to our website, how the information is obtained, how it is used, and how visitors can restrict its use or disclosure. The following discusses our information gathering and dissemination practices for our web site: Scholarships.com.

The only information Scholarships.com obtains about individual visitors to our web site is information supplied voluntarily by the visitor. To gauge the effectiveness of our web site, we do collect some non-individually identifiable generic information about our visitors. Our web servers automatically recognize a visitor's IP address, the web page from which a visitor enters our web site, which pages a visitor visits, and how much time a visitor spends on each page.  This information does not reveal a visitor's identity. We aggregate this information and use it to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our web site, or to evaluate and improve our web site.

A cookie is a very small text file placed on your hard drive by a Web page server.  It is essentially your identification card, and cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.  It is uniquely yours and can only be read by the server that gave it to you.  A cookie's purpose is to tell the server that you are visiting or have returned to that Web page.  Cookies are only used on our web site to time out users who may have forgotten to complete or close their Scholarships.com user session.

Our web site's personal profile questionnaire requires users to give us contact information (name and email address for example), and demographic information (zip code, age, or income level).  Within the personal profile questionnaire, we ask if we may make information about you available to our select list of marketing partners.  Scholarships.com is very careful in selecting its marketing partners. We work with reputable companies and organizations that provide products and services that are useful and of interest to students and parents. Information will not be shared with companies and organizations involved with pornography, tobacco or other industries we find to be objectionable or potentially harmful.

We may use information from the personal profile questionnaire to send users materials or information from our marketing partners or other information specifically requested by the user.

We may also share some information about our web site's users or visitors with our marketing partners.  This information is only provided in the aggregate meaning that the information is about our web site as a whole. We never provide or disclose individually identifiable information to any outside organization other than our marketing partners, who are obligated to uphold our privacy policy by using the information only for its contracted purpose. 

Scholarships.com does not send unsolicited "junk" email. We may use email to communicate with our users, to respond to visitor's email, or to send information that a user has requested.

This web site contains links to other web sites. Scholarships.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.

Scholarships.com is committed to safeguarding users' privacy on our web site.  We require our employees to protect the privacy of information about our users and visitors and expect our sponsors to do so as well. You can feel confident that your individually identifiable information

will be protected when you visit Scholarships.com. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

Guidelines when visitors or users of our web site are children (children under the age of 13), Scholarships.com does:

  * NOT collect online contact information without prior parental consent or parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in our activities.
  * NOT collect personally identifiable off-line contact information without prior parental consent.
  * NOT entice by the prospect of a special game, prize, contest or other activity, to divulge any information.



Choice/Opt-Out:  Our web site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us or our marketing partners or from our sharing user information with our marketing partners. Within the personal profile questionnaire, we ask if we may make information about you available to our select list of marketing partners.  Simply select the box marked "No" and your individually identifiable information will not be shared with our marketing partners.  You may also visit your Scholarships.com user Mailbox account where you'll have the opportunity to change, modify or delete information previously provided. 

To improve our web site and the services we offer, Scholarships.com may opt to expand its capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future.  Scholarships.com will update this privacy statement continually to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.

Scholarships.com has adopted privacy principals that state our commitment and define our policy on safeguarding visitor and user privacy when we conduct our business.
