# Privacy Statement

**Privacy at Scholarships.com** ****

**Scholarships.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. When you visit a Web site displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, you can expect to be notified of: what personally identifiable information of yours is collected; what organization is collecting the information; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; what kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company's control; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.** ****

At Scholarships.com, your privacy is important to us.

Scholarships.com maintains high standards for the protection of your privacy over the Internet. Scholarships.com has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and to explain the types of information we obtain about visitors to our website, how the information is obtained, how it is used, and how visitors can restrict its use or disclosure. The following discusses our information gathering and dissemination practices for our website, Scholarships.com.

The only information Scholarships.com obtains about individual visitors to our website is information supplied voluntarily by the visitor.  Our website's personal profile questionnaire requires users to volunteer contact information (name and address for example), and demographic information (zip code, age, or income level).  Within the personal profile questionnaire, we ask if we may make information about you available to our select list of marketing partners (Opt-In/Opt-Out).  Scholarships.com is very careful in selecting its marketing partners.  We work with reputable, leading companies and organizations that provide products and services that are useful and of interest to students and parents. Marketing partners will never be companies or organizations involved with pornography, tobacco or other industries we find to be objectionable or potentially harmful.

**Opt-In/Opt-Out:** Our website provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from our marketing partners.  Within the personal profile questionnaire, we ask if we may make information about you available to our select list of marketing partners. Simply select the box marked "No" (Opt-Out) and your individually identifiable information will not be available to our marketing partners.  You may also go to the section "Profile Update" where you'll have the opportunity to change or delete all personal information previously provided.

We may communicate with our users through email: to respond to visitor's email, to send information that a user has requested, or to inform users of new or updated scholarship awards.

A cookie is a very small text file placed on a website visitor's hard drive by a web server.

It is essentially your identification card, and cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. It is uniquely yours and can only be read by the server that gave it to you.  The cookie's purpose is to tell our web server that you are visiting or have returned to that web page.   
At Scholarships.com cookies are used to time-out a user session: users who may have forgotten to complete or close their Scholarships.com user session.

To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we do collect some non-individually identifiable generic information about our visitors. Our web servers automatically recognize a visitor's IP address, the web page from which a visitor enters our website, which pages a visitor visits, and how much time a visitor spends on each page.  This information does not reveal a visitor's identity. We aggregate this information and use it to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website, or to evaluate and improve our website.

We may share information about our website's visitors with our marketing partners.  This information is only provided in the aggregate, meaning that the information is about our website's visitors as a whole and not individually identifiable visitors.

This website contains links to other websites. Scholarships.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

Scholarships.com is committed to safeguarding users' privacy on our website. We require our employees to protect the privacy of information about our users and visitors and expect our marketing partners to do so as well. You can feel confident that your individually identifiable information will be protected when you visit Scholarships.com.  We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

Guidelines when visitors or users of our website are children (children under the age of 13), Scholarships.com does:

NOT collect online contact information without prior parental consent or parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in our activities.

NOT collect personally identifiable offline contact information without prior parental consent.

NOT entice by the prospect of a special game, prize, contest or other activity, to divulge any information.




To improve our website and the services we offer, Scholarships.com may opt to expand its capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. Scholarships.com will update this privacy statement continually to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.

Scholarships.com has adopted privacy principals that state our commitment and define our policy on safeguarding visitor and user privacy when we conduct our business. Questions regarding this privacy policy statement, the practices of this website, or your dealings with Scholarships.com should be directed to: Scholarships.com, Mr. Kevin Ladd at: [admin@scholarships.com.](mailto:admin@scholarships.com)
