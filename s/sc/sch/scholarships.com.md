# Privacy Statement

**Privacy Policy **

At Scholarships.com, your privacy is important to us.

Scholarships.com maintains high standards for the protection of your privacy over the Internet. Scholarships.com has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and to explain the types of information we obtain about visitors to our website, how the information is obtained, how it is used, and how visitors can restrict its use or disclosure.  The following discusses our information gathering and dissemination practices for our website: Scholarships.com.

The only information Scholarships.com obtains about individual visitors to our website is information supplied voluntarily by the visitor.  To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we do collect some non-individually identifiable generic information about our visitors.  Our web servers automatically recognize a visitor's IP address, the web page from which a visitor enters our website, which pages a visitor visits, and how much time a visitor spends on each page.  This information does not reveal a visitor's identity. We aggregate this information and use it to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website, or to evaluate and improve our website.

Our website's personal profile questionnaire requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level).  Within the personal profile questionnaire, we ask whether information about you can be made available to a select list of sponsors.  Scholarships.com is very careful in selecting its sponsors.  We work with reputable companies and organizations that provide products and services that are useful and of interest to students and parents.  We may use the information from the personal profile questionnaire to send the user materials or information from our sponsors or other information specifically requested by the user.  We may also share some information about our website users or visitors with our sponsors.  This information is only provided in the aggregate meaning that the information is about our website as a whole.  We never provide or disclose individually identifiable information to any outside organization other than our sponsors, who are obligated to uphold our privacy policy by using the information only for its contracted purpose. 

Scholarships.com does not send unsolicited "junk" email.  We may use email to communicate with our users, to respond to visitor's email, or to send information that a user has requested.

This website contains links to other websites.  Scholarships.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

Scholarships.com is committed to safeguarding users' privacy on our website.  We require our employees to protect the privacy of information about our users and visitors and expect our sponsors to do so as well.  You can feel confident that your individually identifiable information will be protected when you visit Scholarships.com.  We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

Guidelines when visitors or users of our website are children (children under the age of 13), Scholarships.com does: 

NOT collect online contact information without prior parental consent or parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in our activities.

NOT collect personally identifiable offline contact information without prior parental consent.

NOT entice by the prospect of a special game, prize, contest or other activity, to divulge any information. 




Choice/Opt-Out:  Our website provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us or our sponsors or from our sharing user information with our sponsors.  Within the personal profile questionnaire, we ask you whether information about you can be made available to a select list of sponsors.  Simply select the box marked "No" and your individually identifiable information will not be shared with our sponsors.  It will be deleted from our records after you complete your scholarship search.  You may also accomplish this by visiting your Scholarships.com mailbox, which gives users the opportunity to change, modify or remove information previously provided.  In addition, when the above discussed question appears, simply change your response by selecting "No".

To improve our website and the services we offer, Scholarships.com may opt to expand its capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future.  Scholarships.com will update this privacy statement continually to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.

Scholarships.com has adopted privacy principals that state our commitment and define our policy on safeguarding visitor and user privacy when we conduct our business.  If you have any questions about this privacy policy statement, the practices of this website, or your dealings with Scholarships.com, please direct them to Mr. Kevin Ladd at the following email address: [ knl@scholarships.com](mailto:knl@scholarships.com)
