Simon & Schuster recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of visitors to our web site. We do not collect personally-identifying information about you except when you voluntarily provide it (for example, when you provide shipping and billing information for an online purchase, when you provide an email address or mailing address to receive additional news, offers, or prizes from Simon & Schuster, or when you post a message to a discussion board or to the Reader Reaction area). 

We consider the following to be personally-identifying information: your name, street address, phone number, credit card information and email address. Personally-identifying information is used by Simon & Schuster to process your online purchases, to inform you about other products and services, to improve the products and services we offer, and otherwise to better meet the needs and preferences of Simon & Schuster customers. Personally-identifying information is treated confidentially within Simon & Schuster. We do not share your personally-identifying information with third parties except for the data provided to those entities involved in processing and fulfilling your online orders. We may also share your personally-identifying information with affiliated companies. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. Simon & Schuster is a responsible company and as such we may disclose your personally-identifying information in order to comply with court orders or subpoenas or when required to do so by law. We may also disclose such data in cooperation with a law enforcement or government request. 

Users should be reminded that any personally-identifying information that is voluntarily posted by a user to a public area of this web site (for example, a posting to a discussion board or to the Reader Reaction area) may always be collected and used by others. We cannot prevent such uses.
