# Privacy Policy | Scholarship America

Scholarship America recognizes the importance of data privacy. We are dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal information you provide to us with care and respect. This privacy policy explains data collection and use.

By accessing the Site and using its services, you confirm that you have read and consent to the information practices described in the policy.

## **What information does Scholarship America collect and how is the information used?**

#### **Information You Provide**

To be considered for a scholarship, tuition assistance or other award administered by Scholarship America, you may be required to submit data to us electronically. Types of personally identifiable information may include, but are not limited to, your full name, address, email address and phone numbers, your parent(s) full name(s), address(es), email address(es) and phone numbers(s), your gender, ethnicity, academic information such as grade point average, class rank and college entrance exam scores, current and future enrollment information, involvement in work, school and community activities, personal essays and birthdate. In some cases, your and/or a parent’s social security number and personal or household financial information may be requested.

Actual information we collect varies based on the program being administered.

Scholarship America processes your personal information provided only for the purpose for which it was collected in accordance with contractual program parameters and this Privacy Policy. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to administer a program or provide a service. We take reasonable steps to ensure the personal information we process is accurate, complete and current, but we depend on users to provide correct personal information to us.

Scholarship America owns all information collected from users of the site. Data you enter during the application process is automatically saved for your convenience. Even if the application is abandoned or not submitted, the information you provide is collected and is subject to this policy.

We may use your contact information to confirm receipt of your application, to gather more information if there are questions regarding your application, to send you notification regarding your status, or for communication necessary to administer a program or provide a service. When you send email or other communications electronically, Scholarship America may retain those communications to process your inquiries, to respond to your request or question and to improve our services. For certain services offered through our site, you have the ability to opt out.  No personal data will be shared with third parties without your explicit choice (opt in) with the exception of the organization sponsoring the scholarship or tuition assistance program.

#### **Information Collected Automatically**

When you visit a Scholarship America site, some information is automatically collected about your visit that does not identify you personally. This information helps us analyze trends to better understand how users view and utilize our site.

Cookies – A cookie is a small data file that a website may send to your browser and which may then be stored on your hard drive. Our websites use cookies to simulate a continuous connection – cookies allow your computer to “remember” information about your preferences and session, and allow you to move within areas of our websites without reintroducing yourself. No personally identifiable information is stored in these cookies. Both session ID and persistent cookies may be used in a site. A session ID cookie will expire at the time you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time and may be set to store your passwords so you do not have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies can be removed by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “Help” file.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Scholarship America applications may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

Log Information – Our servers automatically record information your browser sends whenever you visit a site. These server logs may include information such as your internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language, refer/exit pages, your operating system, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

Our website may use other technologies to track and analyze user activity on our site.

## **Does Scholarship America SHARE the information I’ve provided?**

** ** Scholarship America does not provide any personal information to outside organizations or entities unless specified in detail within program guidelines.

Limited information may be provided to a program sponsor for verification of eligibility. Identifiable information from applicants not selected as recipients is kept confidential to Scholarship America, but may be shared with sponsors who have a legal right to know. In programs in which the sponsor or another entity is responsible for the review and/or selection of recipients, relevant information may be released to the sponsor or other entity. All users acknowledge release of such information by supplying an electronic signature prior to submission of their data.

Scholarship America may use third parties to provide certain services on our behalf (“Service Providers”). Personal information will only be shared as necessary for Service Providers to conduct their services. Service Providers are prohibited from using data for any other purpose.

Scholarship America is not responsible for the use and security of information once it is in the care or control of a program sponsor or other designated entity as specified by the program.

Non-personally identifiable information may be shared as aggregate demographic information to program sponsors or may be used by Scholarship America in pursuit of its philanthropic goals.

Scholarship America reserves the right to disclose personal information as required by law.

## **How does Scholarship America SECURE my personal information?**

Scholarship America is committed to properly securing the information we collect online. To help us accomplish this, we take the following steps:

  * We employ internal access controls to ensure that the only people who see your information are those with a need to do so to perform their official duties;
  * We train relevant personnel on our privacy and security measures. Personnel are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations;
  * We physically secure the servers and the areas where we hold hard copies of the information we collect online;
  * We regularly back up the information we collect online to insure against loss;
  * We use technical controls to secure the information we collect online as appropriate, including encryption, firewalls and password protections;
  * We periodically test our security procedures to ensure personnel and technical compliance.



Scholarship America follows industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, however. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## **Donor Privacy Policy**

Scholarship America is committed to the privacy and security of both online and offline donors. All donors to Scholarship America provide certain information which may include names, contact information and financial data. We protect this information in a variety of ways.

We will not sell, share or trade donor information with any other entity, and we will not send mailings to our donors on behalf of other organizations, unless a donor has given us specific permission to do so.

In cases where donations are processed through a third-party service provider, donor information will only be used as necessary to process the donation. All processing of payments and related information is protected by industry standard safeguards.

## **Links to Other Sites**

This Privacy Policy applies to data collected on sites administered by Scholarship America only. The site may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Scholarship America. Be aware when you leave our site and read the privacy statements pertaining to other sites you may link to.

## **Business Transitions**

If Scholarship America becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale, it is likely personal information will be among the assets transferred.

## **Privacy Protection for Children under Age 13**

Scholarship America does not collect personal information directly from children who are under 13 years old. However, a child of this age may occasionally be eligible for certain programs or services administered through our site, in which case, a parent or legal guardian of such child must provide the child’s personal information to Scholarship America. The parent or legal guardian must also provide his or her own contact information (e.g., email address, mailing address and phone numbers). All communications pertaining to the program or service will be sent directly to such parent or legal guardian. The personal information (identifiable or not) of such parent or legal guardian collected is subject to this privacy policy.

Unless otherwise stated herein, this privacy policy applies to a child’s information that we collect from a parent or legal guardian, except that (1) we do not share identifiable information of a child with any third party (other than the Program sponsors, or our agent or Service Providers, for the purposes stated in this privacy policy), (2) we will only send our promotional communications or newsletters to the parent or the legal guardian who provided the child’s  information to us, and (3) we do not link or tie, and prohibit third party advertisers from tying or linking, any such child’s identifiable information to log files, cookies, or other tracking mechanisms used on the Site.

Because our websites and business units will continue to implement new technologies and improve the services and features we provide, this policy is subject to change. If there are changes or additions to this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here or in other formats we deem acceptable, so that you will always know what information we collect online, how we use it and what choices you have.
