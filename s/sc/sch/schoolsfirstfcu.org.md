_As permitted by law:_ We may disclose information we have gathered about you as permitted or required by law. For example, information may be disclosed in connection with a subpoena or similar legal process or to credit bureaus. 

_To parties that provide services for us:_ We may disclose information we have gathered about you to companies that perform services on our behalf.

How We Protect Your Information

Access to information about you is limited to those teammembers, our employees, who provide products or services to you. Our teammembers are trained and understand the importance of safeguarding your information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that meet or exceed federal standards to protect your information. 

SchoolsFirst FCU's Online Banking system provides secure financial services over the Internet through a protocol known as the Secure Sockets Layer. To access Online Banking, you will need access to a computer with Internet access and a Secure Sockets Layer compatible browser. The Secure Sockets Layer validates the identity of our site to our Members by using a digital certificate. 

When you enter Online Banking, encryption is automatically enabled. This is called a secure site. To verify if an Internet session is secure, check the key icon in the corner of your browser's screen. If the key appears intact, then encryption is activated. 

You can help protect your information by using the "Log Out" option to exit Online Banking. For added security, your account will be logged out of Online Banking after 15 minutes of inactivity. 

[Click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20090924030346id_/http%3A//www.schoolsfirstfcu.org/onlinesecurity/overview.asp) for more information about the Secure Sockets Layer or the use of encryption. 

_An Important Note About Email_

When opening an email link, your email application is automatically started for you in an unsecured environment. Please use the info@SchoolsFirstfcu.org link to send general comments, questions, or feedback only. If you have specific questions or problems about your account, we recommend that you contact us by telephone at 714/258-4000 or 800/462-8328. 

_Links_

Our web site may contain links to other sites. Please note that the privacy policy at these other sites may be different from ours. You should review the privacy policy of any site linked to our site before providing any information. 

_Children_

We do not solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13 on our web site. When you browse our web site, you do so anonymously; information about you is not collected. 

Information on Public Records

You may be aware that businesses can obtain certain consumer information, such as that related to mortgage loans, which is a matter of public record and available to anyone from the County Recorder’s Office. Unfortunately, this information is often used by companies to market their products and services directly to you. At times, they also make reference to the credit union, which may imply that they obtained the information from us. The lenders’ names, as well as certain details of the loans, are included in the public records, and that is where they obtain their data. 

How to Remove Your Name from Credit Offers

If you prefer not to receive unsolicited pre-approved credit or insurance offers, you can remove your name from lists used by credit reporting agencies (CRAs) for these purposes. To remove your name and address, call 888/5OPTOUT (888/567-8688) or go to [www.optoutprescreen.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20090924030346id_/http%3A//www.schoolsfirstfcu.org/website/ext_url.asp?url=http://www.optoutprescreen.com/). By removing your name, you will no longer receive unsolicited credit offers from the credit union or other businesses, such as credit card companies, department stores and banks. 

When you call to remove your name from credit bureau lists, you will be given a choice to opt out for five years or permanently. Even though your request becomes effective within a week of calling, it may take several months before you see a reduction in the amount of unsolicited offers of credit. 

How to Reduce Telemarketing Calls

The National Do Not Call Registry was created to offer consumers a choice regarding telemarketing calls and gives you an opportunity to limit the telemarketing calls you receive. The National Do Not Call Registry is managed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation’s consumer protection agency. Thirty-one days after placing your phone number on the registry, most (but not all) telemarketers should stop calling. For more information on the National Do Not Call Registry, or to register your phone number, go to [www.donotcall.gov](https://web.archive.org/web/20090924030346id_/http%3A//www.schoolsfirstfcu.org/website/ext_url.asp?url=http://www.donotcall.gov/) or call 888/382-1222. 

Telephone numbers placed on the National Do Not Call Registry will remain on it permanently (unless you choose to remove it) due to the Do-Not-Call Improvement Act of 2007, which became law in February 2008. If you have previously registered your phone number, your registration will not expire after five years, but instead will be permanent. 

How to Reduce Junk Mail

The Direct Marketing Association (DMA) sponsors Mail Preference Service (MPS), which has been helping consumers since 1971 limit the national non-profit or commercial mail they receive at home. If you would like to reduce the amount of advertising you receive from companies, you can register for this service online or by mail. The DMA charges a $1 fee for mail registrations. 

If you contact this agency, you will have the option of removing your name from catalog offers of specific companies, other mail offers of specific companies, or all mail offers. Your name will be removed from your list(s) of choice for three years. Removing your name from these lists will not end all solicitations from businesses that do not subscribe to the service or companies with which you do business. To eliminate mail from those businesses—as well as mail addressed to “occupant” or “resident”—write directly to each source. 

Working Together to Protect Your Identity

We are committed to ensuring the protection of your personal information as well as the safety of our Members’ funds. 

You may want to find out if any credit accounts have been opened in your name without your consent. 

Free Credit Reports

You are entitled to receive one free credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide consumer credit reporting agencies– Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. 

These three consumer reporting agencies have set up a central web site, a toll-free telephone number and a mailing address through which you can order your free annual report. To order, visit [www.annualcreditreport.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20090924030346id_/http%3A//www.schoolsfirstfcu.org/website/ext_url.asp?url=http://www.annualcreditreport.com/), call 877/322-8228, or print and complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form (available online at [www.ftc.gov/credit](https://web.archive.org/web/20090924030346id_/http%3A//www.schoolsfirstfcu.org/website/ext_url.asp?url=http://www.ftc.gov/)) and mail it to: 

**Annual Credit Report Request Service**  
P.O. Box 105281  
Atlanta, GA 30348-5281 

Do not contact these three consumer reporting agencies individually. Free annual credit reports are available only through the above methods. 

When ordering your free report you will be asked to provide your name, address, date of birth, and social security number. In addition, you may be asked to provide further identifying information based on information contained in your credit report. 

Only one web site, [www.annualcreditreport.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20090924030346id_/http%3A//www.schoolsfirstfcu.org/website/ext_url.asp?url=http://www.annualcreditreport.com/), is authorized to fulfill orders for the free annual credit report you are entitled to by law. Other web sites that claim to offer free credit reports, free credit scores or free credit monitoring are not part of the legally-mandated free annual credit report program. In some cases, the “free” product comes with strings attached. 

For more information, refer to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brochure, “Your Access to Free Credit Reports,” available on the FTC’s web site at [www.ftc.gov](https://web.archive.org/web/20090924030346id_/http%3A//www.schoolsfirstfcu.org/website/ext_url.asp?url=http://www.ftc.gov/). 

Report Identity Theft

If someone has fraudulently used your identity to establish credit, contact your credit union immediately and then report the incident as quickly as possible to each of the consumer reporting agencies:
