##  Privacy 

### Introduction

Station Casinos. has a strong commitment to providing excellent service to all of our customers, including respecting their concerns about privacy. We understand that visitors to our website may have questions about whether and how this website collects and uses information.

Station Casinos respects your privacy. We will not share or use your mobile number for any other purpose. We will only use information you provide to transmit your text message. Nonetheless, we reserve the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation or governmental request, to avoid liability, or to protect our rights or property. When you complete forms online or otherwise provide us information in connection with the Service, you agree to provide accurate, complete and true information. You agree not to use a false or misleading name or a name that you are not authorized to use. If we, in our sole discretion, believe that any such information is untrue, inaccurate or incomplete, we may refuse you access to the Service and pursue any appropriate legal remedies.

###  Browsing

Visitors who browse this website do so on an anonymous basis. We have not configured this website to collect any information from your computer without your input. This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with information, we will not know your identity, your e-mail address, or any other information identifiable to you.

### Information

When we need to collect information from you, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our hotels or resorts, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card type, credit card number, expiration date and room preference (non-smoking room or no preference) to process your reservation. We will use your e-mail address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help to process the reservation. The same type of information would be requested to complete a gift certificate transaction. For our e-mail community, we will use your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address to process your subscription and to also unsubscribe from the mailing list. When we ask you for personal data when making a reservation or purchasing a gift certificate, including your name, address and credit card data, it is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line provided you are using a SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from your computer. You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock icon in the lower right hand corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position. In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." After information reaches Station Casinos it is stored on a secure server that resides behind a firewall that is designed to block access from outside the company.

We may also ask you to fill out an online customer survey, to obtain your suggestions or comments about your use of Station Casinos services, or for similar purposes. Providing this information is voluntary.

### Internet Protocol (IP) Address

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer every time you browse the Internet. When users request a page from our site, our servers log the user's current IP address. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. Thus, each user session is anonymous.

### Station Casinos Use of Information

We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and strict corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our hotels or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information is generally processed and stored in the United States, in which data protection laws are not as comprehensive as in the European Union.

The gift certificate, e-mail community, survey and other such non-reservations information is used only for the purpose for which the information was collected and is not used for direct marketing or shared with other companies. The personal information you provide to us for making a reservation is made available to the applicable hotel for the purpose of meeting your reservation request. If you cancel your reservation, the information is stored for record-keeping purposes only and is not accessed again. After completing your stay at a Station Casinos hotel or resort, the information you provide may be used for direct marketing by a Station Casinos hotel or resort, or Green Valley Ranch Resort. Station Casinos may use the services of a third party mail house for the sole purpose of mailing materials.

### Employment Opportunities

When you submit an application or a profile for potential employment, you authorize Station Casinos to transmit and/or store your information for future consideration. The information collected will be accessible by Station Casinos employees or agents relevant to the recruitment process. The information collected will be used to (i) assess qualifications and personal experience to determine if it meets specific job requirements; and (ii) help us inform candidates of future openings at Station Casinos.

### Disclosure of Information and Opt-Out

Station Casinos will not sell, trade, rent or release such information to entities outside of Station Casinos family of companies and hotels, for their use without your approval and giving you the opportunity to opt-out.

When you join Email Community, and provide your e-mail address, we will periodically contact you via e-mail and provide information about Station Casinos special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you.
