_Resolution Information_  
If you resolve a case, the Resolution or the Settlement Agreement, and the time and date stamp of your signature. 

All case records are confidential. All of the information we gather is stored in a secure database. 

**Tracking**  
There are two ways to maintain user experience throughout a "transaction" on SquareTrade's site. One is by identifying a user by their IP address, and the other is by setting a cookie. Since some users use proxy services to access the Internet (and do not have a fixed IP address), SquareTrade uses cookies for all users. 

To enhance the dispute resolution experience and training of mediators, SquareTrade tracks information, including details of the case, the transaction, the problem, communications that a user had with the other party and with the SquareTrade Mediator. 

In order to help us improve the site user experience you agree that we may use personally identifiable information about you to, analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our site's content, layout and services. We also track how users navigate the site by assigning cookies to site visitors. This data is NOT connected with user registration and hence, is NOT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE. This means that while we know how many people have visited a particular page on the site, we do not know WHO these people are. 

If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use SquareTrade's services that require you to "sign in" or "register". However, you can still use SquareTrade to obtain general information. 

SquareTrade cookies are inactive once a user leaves our site. If you are still uncomfortable with the SquareTrade cookies, you can always delete and/or disable your cookies after your SquareTrade session is over.

  * Provide you with a CarePlan and customer service.
  * Verify Seal Members' identities, on application and over time.
  * Contact a Seal Member or license holder if applicable, if a case is filed concerning you.
  * Bill for the Seal, Product Protection Plan, and Mediation services.

You will have the choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our confidentiality practices that affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change.
