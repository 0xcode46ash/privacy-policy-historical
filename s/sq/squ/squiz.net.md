# Privacy

This policy applies to Squiz Australia Pty Ltd, Squiz UK Limited and Squiz NZ ("Squiz") and explains how Squiz uses personal information collected through this website.

There are two types of information collection that occur on this website that we'd like to tell you about – actually we're legally bound to but, hey, sharing is caring, right?

## Direct collection (i.e. Personal Information you provide)

We store the personal information you enter on the Squiz web server and download copies of information from time to time. Most information of this type is collected through forms you fill in such as the "Contact Squiz" form. In all cases of direct collection, Squiz will state what the information will be used for. If any personal information is to be available for public access this will be explicitly stated at the time of information collection (for example the community forums).

## Automatic collection using Cookies:

We may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign your computer a 'User ID'. Cookies do not contain information by which Squiz can identify you - they only identify your computer to our servers.

Cookies are used by our website to enable certain functionality, to remember the preferences of our users and to monitor how the site is being used. They help us to enhance the usability of the website and to personalise our content to better suit your needs.

Generally, these cookies expire at the end of each browsing session. You may, however, restrict or block these cookies through your browser settings. Please refer to your browser's 'Help' function or visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) for detailed information about how to do this on a wide variety of browsers. Please note that if you disable any, or all, cookies you may have a degraded user experience.

Squiz may use information it collects from you for the primary purpose for which it is collected and for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose of collection.

### Cookies used on this site

#### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to measure which pages on our site attract the most interest and to inform our content strategy so we can ensure we deliver the best quality content possible.

#### Marketo  


Marketo helps us learn what specific solutions you might be seeking so that we can provide you with the most relevant content on our site, at events or in email communications.

If you fill in a form to download content, request more information or just to get in touch, you may receive follow-up emails from us with content and offers relevant to you.

You can always opt out of receiving emails from us by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email or by visiting our email subscription management page [here](http://engage.squiz.net/unsubscribe.html).

#### OpenTracker

This is similar to Google Analytics in that it allows us to track how you move through the site.  We use it to monitor use of our site in real time to make sure we're providing useful and relevant content to you.

#### Personalisation Cookie

We have built a personalisation feature that tailors content to your country and the industry it appears you might be from.  We do this by using your IP address and map that to a country to serve up local content like case studies and the contact details of our nearest office.
