# Privacy Policy - Squiz UK

This policy applies to Squiz Australia Pty Ltd and Squiz UK Limited ("Squiz") and explains how Squiz uses personal information collected through this website.

Squiz is legally bound to tell you what information is being collected and what it will be used for. There are two types of information collection that occur on this website:

  *  **Direct collection** (i.e. Personal Information you provide): We store the personal information you enter on the Squiz web server and download copies of information from time to time. Most information of this type is collected through forms you fill in such as the "Contact Squiz" form. In all cases of direct collection, Squiz will state what the information will be used for. If any personal information is to be available for public access this will be explicitly stated at the time of information collection (for example the community forums). 
  * **Automatic collection using Cookies** : We may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign your computer a 'User ID'. Cookies do not contain information by which Squiz can identify you - they only identify your computer to our servers. 

Cookies are used by our website to enable certain functionality, to remember the preferences of our users and to monitor how the site is being used. They help us to enhance the usability of the website and to tailor our content to better meet your needs.

Generally, these cookies expire at the end of each browsing session. You may, however, restrict or block these cookies through your browser settings. Please refer to your browser's 'Help' function or visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) for detailed information about how to do this on a wide variety of browsers. Please note that if you disable any, or all, cookies you may have a degraded user experience. 




Squiz may use information it collects from you for the primary purpose for which it is collected and for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose of collection.
