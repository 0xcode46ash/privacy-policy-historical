**Privacy Policy**

We would like you to know how we handle the information we learn about you from your visit to our Squigly's Playhouse. The information we gather depends upon what you do when visiting our site.

1. | 

If you visit our site to play games, download activities or just read our pages, the following information about your visit is recorded:

> The name of the **domain** from which you access the internet (e.g. webtv.net, aol.com, globalserve.net); the **date and time** you accessed our site; and the internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site (the **referrer** ).
> 
> The type of **browser** you are using (e.g. Internet Explorer 4.5) and what **platform** (e.g. Power Macintosh).

This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site and gives us a better understanding of which activities our visitors enjoy doing while there.

2. | 

If you send us e-mail via any form (Contest, Question, Write to Squigly, Maze Feedback and Joke, Brain Teaser and Writing Corner Submissions) we record the following information:

> Your **name** is only recorded to accompany your submission as posted on our website (e.g. a joke, story etc.). Otherwise this information is discarded. You are never required to enter your last name since it will never be included in your posting.
> 
> Your **e-mail address** is optional and, if included, is added to our mailing list without your name. If you have asked a question or requested a response, this address is used to reply to you. We do not share, sell or trade this mailing list with anyone.
> 
> Your **age** is optional and is recorded for two reasons: to accompany your submission; and for statistical purposes. It helps us to make age appropriate activities.
> 
> Your **state/province** is optional and is only recorded to accompany your submission.
> 
> Your **country** is recorded for two reasons: to accompany your submission; and for statistical purposes.

Our forms also collect information on the type of **browser** you are using (e.g. Internet Explorer 4.5) and what **platform** (e.g. Power Macintosh). This information is only used should you be inquiring about a technical difficulty. Otherwise the information is discarded.  
  
Once a particular theme has finished, all e-mail messages received during that theme are deleted. Submissions, as they appear in published form, are retained for potential future republication.

E-mail addresses are retained on the mailing list until you request that it be removed.

Answers to our question are recorded only by answer given and are not associated with any other information provided on the same form.

Once you have submitted something to Squigly's Playhouse, that submission becomes the property of Squigly's Playhouse but credit is given to the submitter if and when the submission is published.

We want you to be very certain: We will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us.

If you have any further questions or concerns please write to [Squigly@SquiglysPlayhouse.com](mailto:Squigly@SquiglysPlayhouse.com). If you write to us directly (i.e. not through one of the forms listed above), your e-mail address is not added to our mailing list, but is used only to allow us to reply to you if you have requested a response.
