4. | Our [Mailing List](https://web.archive.org/web/20000621001918id_/http%3A//www.squiglysplayhouse.com/MailingList.html) form requests only an **e-mail address**. Each recipient on the list will receive an update announcing new activities at Squigly's Playhouse (generally once a month). Each address is retained on the list until either a removal request is received from that address or it fails to receive mail. No personally-identifying information is ever associated with the e-mail addresses on the list.  
  
Once a particular theme has finished, all e-mail messages received during that theme are deleted (except mailing list addresses). Submissions, as they appear in published form, are retained for potential future republication.

Answers to our question are recorded only by answer given and are not associated with any other information provided on the same form.

Once you have submitted something to Squigly's Playhouse, that submission becomes the property of Squigly's Playhouse but credit is given, wherever possible, to the submitter if and when the submission is published.

We want you to be very certain: We will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us and we will never divulge any such information to any other party.

If you have any further questions or concerns please write to [Squigly@SquiglysPlayhouse.com](mailto:Squigly@SquiglysPlayhouse.com).
