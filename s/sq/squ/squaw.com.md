# Privacy Policy | Squaw Valley - Lake Tahoe Ski Resort

It is part of the KSL Resort's Mission Statement that at all of the resorts of KSL Resorts, we strive to create "Customers for Life." One of the ways that we work towards this goal is by respecting your privacy as you explore the unique websites of our resorts, in addition to KSLResorts.com. This Privacy Statement applies to information collected by KSL Resorts and our resorts (collectively, "we" or "KSL Resorts") whether online through KSLResorts.com and the websites of our resorts (the "KSL Websites"), in person when you provide information to our resorts, or from third parties to whom you have provided information. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about the types of information we gather about you when you visit the KSL Websites or our resorts, information we may receive from third parties or affiliates, how we may use that information, whether we disclose that information to anyone and the choices you have regarding of our use, and your ability to correct, the information.

This policy does not apply to other websites which are linked to any of the KSL Websites. Please also be aware that our promotional partners, advertisers, sponsors, tenants and concessionaires accessible through the KSL Websites or at our resorts and websites owned or controlled by independent third party owners of hotel, resort, or residence properties that may have the ability to book reservations through KSL Resorts, or websites not controlled or authorized by KSL Resorts may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. We are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing personally identifiable information to them.

 **How We Collect and Use Information**  
We collect information in several ways by your use of the KSL Websites or your interaction with us at our resorts. When you log onto a KSL Website, our servers log your IP address, the URL of your request and other information that is provided in the HTTP header. When you conduct searches on the KSL Websites, we may log the search terms that you use. KSL Resorts collects this information in order to provide information about our products and services that will meet the expectations of our guests.

"Cookies" are small files that are stored on your machine and may be used to store your personal information. For example, we use "cookies" to (i) customize content specific to your interests, (ii) ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly and (iii) store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the KSL Websites.

A "pixel tag" is a clear (transparent) image placed on a web page to collect information about the page view. KSL Resorts uses pixel tags to aggregate web traffic information, such as the number of unique visitors, the top paths through the site, entry pages and exit pages. KSL Resorts does not use pixel tags to collect any personal information such as your name, age, phone number, address or e-mail address from visitors and we do not maintain a database of individual browsing profiles.

KSL Resorts may collect information about you so that we can provide an experience that is responsive to our guests' and visitors' needs. We may collect information as part of: (i) fulfilling reservation or information requests, (ii) purchasing products or services, (iii) registering for program membership, (iv) engaging in various activities at our resorts, (iv) submitting a job application, or (v) responding to communications from us (e.g., surveys, promotional offers, contests or sweepstakes, or reservation confirmations). We endeavor to collect information only with your knowledge or (based upon this privacy statement) your expectation and with your permission if necessary.

The types of personally identifiable information we collect may include your name, email addresses, telephone and fax numbers, credit card information, date of birth, gender, and lifestyle information such as room preferences, leisure activities, names and ages of children, and other information either desirable to provide quality services to our guests and visitors or necessary to fulfill special requests (e.g., health conditions that require special room accommodations). We may also collect information about you, such as your use of our KSL Websites, travel habits, communication preferences, and aggregated data relative to your stays.

We will use the information we collect from you to fulfill reservations that you have made with us and to provide goods or services which you have requested or purchased from us. We may also use your personal information to send you a pre-arrival message summarizing your confirmation details and providing other information about the area and the hotel, notify you about news, special offers and promotions, and send you copies of your hotel bills when you request them. KSL Resorts may also use third party service providers to send and distribute e-mail and to perform other marketing and product support functions. You can opt-out of receiving e-mails from KSL Resorts at any time by selecting the opt-out link included in the e-mail or by sending an email to [webmaster@kslresorts.com](mailto:webmaster@kslresorts.com?subject=UNSUBSCRIBE) with “UNSUBSCRIBE” in the subject line

 **Sharing Personal Information Collected on our Websites**  
We may share your personal information among KSL Resorts' affiliates, owners and operators of our managed hotels, and KSL Capital Partners, LLC and it's affiliated companies. We may also share information with select third parties who offer goods or services we think may be of interest to you. From time to time we may partner with other companies to provide co-sponsored or co-branded promotions, products and services and may share your information with our co-sponsor. For example, we may co-sponsor some sweepstakes or contests on our site with other companies or we may provide prizes for sweepstakes and contests sponsored by other companies. If you enter one of these sweepstakes or contests, we may share your personal information with our co-sponsor or the third-party sponsor. When you use a credit card to purchase goods or services, we may share your information with the credit card company and other companies involved in the authorization process. Use of shared information is subject to third parties' policies.

We rely on service providers to help us deliver products and services, such as offering products and services, providing services in connection with our websites including airline and rental car packages, communicating news and delivering promotional materials via email and direct mail, processing credit card transactions, and administering sweepstakes and surveys.

During the course of our business we may also share aggregated demographic and statistical information that is not personally identifiable.

KSL Resorts is committed to protecting the security of any personal information you provide. For these reasons, certain financial information, such as credit card data, will generally be transferred over a Secured Socket Layer (SSL) connection (provided that it is supported or enabled on your browser). In spite of these protections, any information submitted over the Internet could be intercepted or otherwise corrupted during transmission. As such, KSL Resorts cannot guarantee the security of any data submitted over the Internet. After your information reaches KSL Resorts, however, it is stored on servers (or in the case of information received from you in person or over the phone in storage areas) protected by procedures and technology designed to block reasonably foreseeable intrusions by unauthorized third parties. The servers are under the control of KSL Resorts at all times but may be hosted, managed or otherwise maintained by third party service providers. These third party service providers have no right to use or access this data other than at the direct request (or on behalf of) of KSL Resorts.

Third Party Links  
The KSL Websites may list or link to third party products or services. KSL Resorts does not have any control over the quality, safety or legality of the items advertised, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of suppliers to sell items or the ability of buyers to buy items. For these reasons, KSL Resorts and its affiliates cannot ensure that a buyer or supplier will actually complete a transaction. KSL Resorts will not be a party to any transactions between you and such third parties and any correspondence concerning such transactions should be conducted between you and the third party.

Minors  
KSL Resorts does not seek to obtain nor does it wish to receive personally identifiable information directly from minors; however, we cannot always determine the age of persons who access and use our websites.
