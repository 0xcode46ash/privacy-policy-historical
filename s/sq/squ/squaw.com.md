# Privacy Policy | Squaw Valley

### **Privacy Policy - Squaw Valley/Alpine Meadows**

Privacy Policy - Squaw Valley/Alpine Meadows This privacy policy for the [www.squaw.com](http://www.squaw.com/) website, operated by Squaw Valley Ski Corporation ("Squaw Valley"), describes the privacy practices for Squaw Valley (the "Privacy Policy"). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather about you, including information gathered when you visit the Squaw Valley website located at [www.squaw.com](http://www.squaw.com/), Squaw Valley's mobile site or downloadable mobile applications (collectively, the "Site"), and information we may receive from third parties or affiliates, how we may use that information, whether we disclose that information to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. Squaw Valley strives to help visitors of the Site protect their privacy while using our Site. By using the Site, you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of information as described in this Privacy Policy.

This policy does not apply to other websites which are linked to any of the Site. Please also be aware that our promotional partners, advertisers, sponsors, tenants and concessionaires accessible through the Site or at our resort and websites owned or controlled by independent third party owners of hotel, resort, or residence properties that may have the ability to book reservations through Squaw Valley, or websites not controlled or authorized by Squaw Valley may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. We are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing personally identifiable information to them.

### How We Collect and Use Information

We collect information in several ways by your use of the Site, as well as from forms you submit to us, personal correspondence (such as emails or letters) that you send to us and or your interaction with us at our resort. We may ask you to voluntarily provide us with personal information on this Site. When you log onto the Site, our servers may log your IP address, the URL of your request and other information that is provided in the HTTP header. When you conduct searches on the Site, we may log the search terms that you use. Squaw Valley collects this information in order to provide information about our products and services that will meet the expectations of our guests. Also, our third-party service providers may ask you voluntarily to provide personal information on their websites and may share such personal information with us, as governed by their respective privacy policies. Our use of information received from a service provider will be dictated by the service provider's privacy policies and not this Privacy Policy.

We collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you ("Personally Identifiable Information"). We also may collect information that by itself typically cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (for example, your age, profession or gender), user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Site ("Non-Personally Identifiable Information").

The types of Personally Identifiable Information we collect may include your name, email addresses, telephone and fax numbers, credit card information, date of birth, gender, photograph, image, social media information, such as your social media usernames, and lifestyle information such as room preferences, leisure activities, names and ages of children, and other information either desirable or necessary to provide quality services to our visitors (e.g., health conditions that require special accommodations). We may also collect information about you, such as your use of our Site, travel habits, communication preferences, and aggregated data relative to your visits to Squaw Valley. If you are a parent registering your child for lessons or other services provided by Squaw Valley, we may collect information concerning your child's medical needs or health.

Squaw Valley may collect information about you so that we can provide an experience that is responsive to our guests' and visitors' needs. We may collect information as part of: (i) fulfilling reservation or information requests, (ii) purchasing products or services, including tickets, (iii) applying or registering for season passes, (iv) engaging in social networking; (v) engaging in various activities at our resort, (vi) submitting a job application, or (vii) responding to communications from us (e.g., surveys, promotional offers, contests or sweepstakes, or reservation confirmations). We endeavor to collect information only with your knowledge or (based upon this Privacy Policy) your expectation and with your permission if necessary.

To the extent we are able to do so, we may link your Non-Personally Identifiable Information with your Personally Identifiable Information. We may also link information collected online with information we collect offline or information collected online by third parties. We may also receive information about you that is collected online by third parties, such as social networking sites, or other online services, which we may link with information we collect online or offline. Our use of any information received from third parties is governed by such third parties’ privacy policies, and not by this Privacy Policy. You may have the ability to upload information from your account on the Site to social media websites or webpages. In the event that you elect to do so, use of the uploaded information by or on the social media site will be dictated by the social media site’s privacy policy.

Like many other websites, the Site may use cookies to customize content specific to your interests and track your use of the Site. "Cookies" are text files that are stored on your computer and may be used to store your personal information. For example, we use "cookies" to (i) customize content specific to your interests, (ii) ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly and (iii) store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Site. In addition to cookies, Squaw Valley may use other now known or later developed technologies to assist Squaw Valley in observing the behavior of users visiting the Site. These technologies access individual user information but the information is used only to compile aggregated statistics about the Site's usage.

A "pixel tag" is a clear (transparent) image placed on a web page to collect information about the page view. This Site may use pixel tags to aggregate web traffic information, such as the number of unique visitors, the top paths through the site, entry pages and exit pages. Squaw Valley does not use pixel tags to collect any personal information such as your name, age, phone number, address or e-mail address from visitors and we do not maintain a database of individual browsing profiles.

This Site uses a web analytics service (and in the future may use other similar sites or services) to better assist Squaw Valley in understanding how the Site is used. The analytics service will place cookies on your computer that will generate information that we select about your use of the Site, including your computer’s IP address. That information will be transmitted to and stored by the analytics service. The information will be used for the purpose of evaluating consumer use of the Site, compiling reports on Site activity for Squaw Valley's use, and providing other services relating to Site activity and usage. The analytics service may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on the analytics service's behalf. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. Please note that by doing so, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site.

We may use technology that provides us with information about your geographic location (“Location Information”). For example, we may scan or collect information regarding your ski pass when you ride a chairlift at our resort. This information helps us monitor ski resort activity and provide better service to you. We also may combine Location Information with other information you provide to us online or with information collected offline. We will use Location Information collected and combined in that manner in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We will use the information we collect from you to provide goods or services which you have requested or purchased from us, including to provide you with notifications related to your activity on the Site or your use of any of the services offered on the Site (the "Services"). We may also use your personal information to send you targeted communications, and to notify you about news, events, special offers and promotions. Squaw Valley may also use third-party service providers to send and distribute e-mail and to perform other marketing and product support functions. You can opt-out of receiving marketing and promotional e-mails from Squaw Valley at any time by selecting the opt-out link included in the e-mail or by sending an email to [web@squaw.com](mailto:web@squaw.com) with “UNSUBSCRIBE” in the subject line.

### How We Store Your Information

Squaw Valley is committed to protecting the security of any personal information you provide. For these reasons, on the Site, certain financial information, such as credit card data, will generally be transferred over a Secured Socket Layer (SSL) connection (provided that it is supported or enabled on your browser). After you have submitted any information online to Squaw Valley, we recommend that you end your browser session before leaving your computer. In spite of these protections, any information submitted over the Internet could be intercepted or otherwise corrupted during transmission. As such, Squaw Valley cannot guarantee the security of any data submitted over the Internet.

Squaw Valley will not be a party to any transactions between you and such third parties and any correspondence concerning such transactions should be conducted between you and the third party.
