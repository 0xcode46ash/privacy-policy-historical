# Getting Started With Squidoo (The official overview, FAQ and TOS): Squidoo Privacy Policy

**1) When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it.**

When you sign up for or visit a Squidoo site, you voluntarily give us certain information. This is true for every site you visit, because web surfing leaves a trail behind. The range of information can include you name, photo, comments, likes, your email address, articles you write, links you input along with the information we'll need to pay you, including your tax ID.

You also may decide to give us access your information in other services - for example, you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to Squidoo, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts. Every time you are asked for information, you have the option to decline and to stop using Squidoo, though we'll miss you.

**2) We also track technical information when you use our site.**

We automatically log and store data about how you use our site, including your IP address, the type of browser you have and (possibly) the timing and activities of your visits, including what gets clicked on. This is what happens on every single commercial website we know of, but we want to be clear about what's going on.

We store a cookie on your hard drive in order to customize Squidoo for you when you visit us.

Squidoo tries to continually provide a better, more customized experience. We need to know who you are in order to do that. We also use the information to tag users who violate our TOS, enabling us to block them in the future.

Based on your use of our site, we can make sure that our advertisers can serve more relevant ads. This means that if you like shoes, you’ll probably see more shoe ads. Not only will you see shoe ads on Squidoo, but because advertisers care about how people act across the web, it’s entirely possible that ads you click on one site will change the ads you see on another site.

**We also use the information you may give us to:**

  

  * Send you email featuring news about the site or other updates, including whether or not you have comments.  

  * Respond to inquiries.



The information we collect may be “personally identifiable” (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or “non-personally identifiable” (meaning it can’t be used to specifically identify you). We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above. We may use or store information wherever we do business, including countries outside your own.

  

  * Change your profile at any time;  

  * Link or unlink your account from an account on another service (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). For some services (like Facebook), you can also choose whether or not to publish your activity on Squidoo to that service.  

  * Close your account at any time. After you close your account, you won’t hear from us, but if you revisit the site, we’ll still be aware of that.  
In addition, you have other ways to control your privacy by changing the software you use to access Squidoo. For example:  

  * The browser you use may provide you with the ability to control cookies or other types of local data storage;  

  * Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or other data is shared with us.  

  * If you don’t like what advertisers are doing to interact with you as you travel around the web, find out more here: <http://www.youradchoices.com/>



To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by the device or software provider.

When you use Squidoo to do something in public, it’s in public. That means the work you post is visible to all. See our TOS to find out more about what you own and what you’re responsible for. In addition, we can work with the information you share with us in other ways:

  

  * When you give your consent. This includes sharing information with other services (like Facebook or Twitter) when you’ve chosen to link to your Squidoo account to those services or publish your activity on Squidoo to them.  

  * We may employ third party companies or individuals to process aggregate and individual information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. This includes checking our accounting or improving our security. In addition, some of the information we request may be collected by third party providers on our behalf.  

  * If a law, regulation or legal request requires disclosure of your information, we will disclose it. We honor requests from legitimate legal authorities, and we also don’t hesitate to honor our TOS.  

  * We may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy. 



We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with our partners or others. For example, we may tell a business using Squidoo aggregate data about how people interact with ads.

BUT

Squidoo will never rent or sell your private information, nor will we rent or sell your email address unless you specifically volunteer it to an advertiser. We promise.

Squidoo is not open to membership by anyone **under 18**. There’s no way for us to control who surfs our site, though, so watch your kids, wherever they are online!

We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we'll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Squidoo after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide more prominent notice or obtain your consent as required by law.

Have fun.
