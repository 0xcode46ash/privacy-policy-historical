If squirtdisgrace.com must use any personal information in a manner different from those described, it will seek your consent prior to that use.  squirtdisgrace.com possesses personal information in the United States and in other countries, and in some cases may store personal information outside of your country.

**Information Sharing**

-squirtdisgrace.com has obtained your consent to release personal information.

-The information is being shared with a subsidiary or squirtdisgrace.com affiliate.

-Access, use or distribution of your personal information is, in squirtdisgrace.com’s good faith belief, reasonably required to a) satisfy an applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable government request (e.g. a warrant, subpoena or other court order), b) enforce the Terms and Conditions, and investigate their breach, c) detect and prevent security issues, d) protect against harm to squirtdisgrace.com or its users, and e) to pursue good faith allegations of piracy brought by squirtdisgrace.com or third parties.
