## The Way We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself when registering in the forums to complete that registration. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete the registration. We use the information you provide about someone else when forwarding content only to forward the content. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that process. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

## Our Commitment To Data Security

## Our Commitment To Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

## How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information 

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by updating your profile in the forums. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.
