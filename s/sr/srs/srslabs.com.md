**Our Commitment To Privacy**  
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

**The Information We Collect:**  
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on this website. On some pages, you may be able to place orders, make requests, and register to receive materials. We may collect passive information (including cookie information) that is linked to a name or similarly specific identifier. The types of personal information collected at these pages may include:

  * Name(s)
  * Address(es)
  * Email address(es)
  * Phone number(s)
  * Credit/debit card information
  * Other identifying information
  * Other generic, non-identifying and aggregate information



**The Way We Use Information:**  
If applicable, we use information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order, in some cases, with outside parties not governed by the same privacy policy. We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. If applicable, you may register with our website if you would like to receive more information as well as updates on new products and/or services. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form. We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

**Our Commitment To Data Security**  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.  
**  
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:**  
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

**How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information**  
If applicable, you can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging into your account. You can also correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
