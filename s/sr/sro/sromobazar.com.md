# Sromobazar.com :: Faster growing job and overseas education site

We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting information you submit and some conformity about different policies. 

**Data protection**

In order to operate the Site in an efficient and effective manner and provide users with information on job postings and services that may be of interest to them, Sromobazar may collect personal information, including contact information (such as an email address), from its users. In addition, this information allows us to provide users with private and secure areas to post and modify their original content on our Site (e.g., jobs and resumes). We also automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Site and use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve users in general. 

You agree that Sromobazar may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests (such as relevant job postings, services, educational or other career development opportunities), or provides administrative notices or communications applicable to your use of the Site. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information. Sromobazar may also aggregate certain non-personally identifiable information about its users (such as occupation, location, education and experience) and use such anonymous information to prepare reports that it provides to its users.

We do not sell our users' contact information to anyone for any reason if the user has indicated a desire for us to keep the information private. When posting jobs and resumes, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish to display.

All users should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal information (such as their email address or resume), that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties for which Sromobazar is not responsible. Also, you may have arrived at the Site by following a link from a Sromobazar Site affiliates or other affiliates. If so, please be aware that Sromobazar may share your information with that affiliate and the affiliate may use the information consistent with its privacy policy instead of this one.

Sromobazar may also disclose specific user information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of Sromobazar or other users of the Site. In addition, personal information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy of Sromobazar.

Some Important Tips to Use When Dealing With Prospective Job Providers

Never give your social security number/ID information/license number/passport number etc to a prospective Job Provider.

Never provide credit card or bank numbers or monetary transaction of any sort.

Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of your own country.

Do not provide any non-work related personal information (i.e. social security number, national ID number, personal data, eye color, marital status, etc.) over the phone or online.

You never need to provide data to search for jobs. Logging into the Site is always an optional task for you to take, (although logging in does give you access to smarter job search tools such as Personal Search Agents and Saved Searches).
