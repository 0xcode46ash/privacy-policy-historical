# The Splendid Table: User Privacy

The Splendid Table User Privacy

We want every user (you) to know how we collect and use information about you when you visit this Web site, which is produced by Minnesota Public Radio (MPR). We recognize the importance of privacy to visitors to any MPR Web site. This privacy policy ex plains what type of information is collected from you when you visit this and other MPR Web sites, and how we may use that information.

**Information We Automatically Gather When You Visit MPR Web Sites**  
Like virtually all other Web servers, MPR's Web server automatically creates log files for each visitor who accesses our site. These "access logs" allow us to make our site more useful to our visitors. The access logs do _not_ record a visitor's name, address, phone number, credit card numbers, or any other personally identifying information. Rather, these log files may contain some or all of the following information: 

  * The date of the visit 
  * The time and length of the visit 
  * The path taken through the Web site 
  * The browser being used 
  * A list of files downloaded or viewed 
  * The amount of time spent listening to audio files 
  * The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine accessing our Web site* 
  * Any errors encountered 

_*Most Internet Service Providers use a "dynamic" form of assigning IP Addresses. This means that a visitor may have a different IP Address each time he or she visits an MPR Web site. Also, many Internet Service Providers, including America Online, use "Proxy servers" which provide even more anonymity for visitors._

We use this information to aid the technical administration of the sites and to better understand how each site is functioning for its users. This information may be correlated with your profile, if you have provided this data, to provide special "personalized" services. This information may also be used in aggregate form. 

We may track your visit to sections of our Web sites in order for some site features to function properly for you. In some instances, "cookies" or a similar technology may be used to update your registration records with session information. If you do not wish to accept a cookie from MPR's servers, you can adjust the settings on your browser accordingly. Refusing to accept cookies from the MPR server may result in some limits on the benefits that we can automatically provide as you enjoy the MPR Web sites. 

**Information You Give Us**  
MPR does not collect personally-identifying information from MPR Web sites unless you choose to provide that information to us. Visitors under the age of 18 must obtain permission from their parents or guardians before sending any personally-identifying information to MPR. 

> **Name and Contact Information**  
>  MPR may ask visitors (you) to provide certain personal information when you: register for a contest; sign up for an email list; request information; purchase products or services; contribute material that may be used on the Web site (e.g. recipes, program reviews); participate in a forum, bulletin board or chat; or use an MPR form to become a member of MPR. MPR tells you whether a specific piece of information is required at the time it is requested. 
> 
> This information may be used by MPR to: verify your identity; manage a contest; gather your editorial comments and feedback; contact you for additional information; and fulfill your order or request. MPR may also use this information for marketing and promotional purposes. By providing this information, you may receive occasional email from MPR or selected third-parties. 
> 
> When your name and contact information is to be used as part of an MPR-owned list, you will be informed of that fact, and you will be given the option not to be included on the list. (You may later elect to be removed from an MPR list by following the instructions provided on the MPR Web site.) 
> 
> To maximize the benefits MPR can provide through its network of public radio Web sites and through qualified associations, your name and basic contact information may be exchanged for consideration with select companies and organizations, including with other public radio stations and programs. These companies and organizations may attempt to contact you to promote a product or service which they offer. Such contacts from third parties will only be made with MPR's consent, and MPR will only grant its consent when MPR considers the offer to be of potential interest and benefit to our Web site users. 
> 
> MPR will not share, exchange, rent, or sell any of its lists to political parties or candidates for political office. 
> 
> If you do not want your name and contact information to be used in this way, you may indicate this at the time you provide the information. If an "opt-out" option is not offered, or you decide after you have provided this information that you d o not want MPR to share your information with any company or organization, you may also notify us in an email addressed to [mail@mpr.org](mailto:mail@mpr.org). MPR cannot remove your name from any third party's list; you will have to contact them directly.

> _The Direct Marketing Association (DMA) offers a Mail Preference Service that is designed to assist consumers in decreasing the amount of nonprofit or commercial mail they receive at home. For more information about this service, visit the DMA Web sit e at:[www.the-dma.org](http://www.the-dma.org/) and click on the "Consumers" tab. _
> 
> **Demographic and Profile Information**  
>  MPR occasionally conducts online surveys, sometimes in association with a contest or other offer. These surveys may ask you for demographic information such as ZIP code, age, education or income level. This information is used in an aggregate form to help us understand our audiences and improve our services. Demographic and profile information may be shared with selected third-party organizations, _only on an aggregate basis,_ to describe the nature of our online audiences. 
> 
> **Credit Card Information**  
>  When you engage in money-related transactions on an MPR site, you will be asked for a credit card number. All financial transactions take place only on secure servers. Electronic communication of credit card information is sent only in a secured or encrypted format. Your credit card information is saved, in an encrypted format, on internal systems that are either not connected to the Internet or are protected by advanced firewalls separate from the computers that serve MPR public sites. This information is not made available to any third party and is considered completely confidential. 

**Special Note for MPR Members**  
If you use MPR's secure, online form to become a member or make a contribution to MPR, your name, complete contact information and all contributions will be passed directly to the MPR Membership Department. Your membership information will be protected in full compliance with the [MPR Member Lists Policy](http://access.mpr.org/aboutMPR/docs/membership_list_policy.htm).
