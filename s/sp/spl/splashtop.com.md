**Privacy Policy Updates**

Due to the Internet’s rapidly evolving nature, we may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, we will post the updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at <http://www.splashtop.com/privacy> so such notice is visible when users log-on for the first time after the changes are posted.

**Information We Collect** ****

You can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, in certain instances, you may be given the option to fill out a service registration, complete a survey or other form which could contain personally identifiable information, such as user identification name, an email address, and/or any other information that you voluntarily transmit with your communication to us.

Whenever you visit a Splashtop web page, your browser may send certain information to our server, which we record. This information may include the URL of the referring web page, your browser and OS type, etc.

Through the Products:

Each Splashtop-based software product or service contains an activation time stamp, which is transparently collected by our server the first time you use the Product. You will be assigned a unique user ID number. In addition, as part of acceptance to use the Product, you are authorizing Splashtop to collect information about your use of the Product, including, without limitation, the number of times you use the Product or various applications included with the Product, the duration of use, how many times and the type of technical problems that occur during use of the Product and technical information about your computer and system software and the Product version you are using. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Product is used, diagnosing service or to address technical problems, and improving Product quality and features.

**Choice to Opt-In**

We will not share your personally identifiable information in any way except as described in this Privacy Policy unless you specifically elect to make such information available to third parties by selecting to “opt-in” in various places on the Site or in the Products. For example, prior to making your personally identifiable information available to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, we will give you the opportunity to “opt in” to receive such third party communications. This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

Moreover, we may share your personally identifiable information and/or aggregate information with a parent, subsidiary or affiliate entity in our corporate family or with our agents such as service providers or agencies that provide data security and maintenance services to us. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information and/or aggregate information to third parties if it is necessary to fulfill your product or service order. For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information, such as your email address, to a third party service provider or vendor who sends information on our behalf that you have opted to receive about our products and services; similarly, we may share personally identifiable information such as your credit card number to a payments processing company in order to receive payments or to services agencies who provide browser services related to Splashtop’s Products. Additionally, in the case where you “opt in” to make your personally identifiable information available to other third parties, we may provide that information to partner entities or other third parties. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information (a) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an investigation of a governmental authority, (b) to enforce the Splashtop Terms of Use agreement or to protect our rights or (c) to protect the safety of users of our Site, services and our Products. We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any company or organization without your permission, except we may transfer your personally identifiable information and/or aggregate information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Splashtop participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Splashtop’s assets to which the Site or the Products relate.
