**The Gloss is a property owned and operated by b5media inc.**

b5 is committed to respecting the privacy concerns of its visitors to the b5media Network (“the Websites”). b5 has created this privacy policy (the “Policy”) to establish guidelines that will govern the collection, use, and disclosure of the personal and non-Personal Information of its visitors.

b5 collects three kinds of information from the Websites: (1) your voluntarily provided Personal Information; (2) Anonymous Non-Personal Information; and (3) “Cookie” Based Information.

**Personal Information:** b5 does not automatically collect Personal Information, such as name, residential address, phone number, email address and other personally identifiable information, from its visitors (“Personal Information”). From time to time, b5 will collect Personal Information that is voluntarily provided by its visitors in filling out contest entry forms and subscribing to newsletters and other activities carried out on the Websites. b5 will only collect, use and disclose Personal Information after the visitor has voluntarily agreed to such collection, use and disclosure. b5 also sometimes use email addresses that have been voluntarily provided by its visitors to respond to visitors who communicate with us, to inform winners of contests or to allow subscription to newsletters and other services. All emails from b5 to its visitors include instructions on how to discontinue receipt of emails, newsletters and other communication from b5 and visitors can discontinue such communication at any time. Email addresses from visitors who wish to discontinue receipt of b5’s emails will be removed from b5’s distribution lists. All Personal Information that may identify a visitor and has been collected with the visitor’s consent by b5 is not disclosed in any identifiable form to any other party outside the company except for the fulfillment of the specific purpose identified to the visitor at the time of collection, or as may be required by law.

b5 may disclose such information in anonymous, aggregated and non-personally identifiable form to other parties for marketing, advertising or other purposes and to better understand visitor’s use of the Website. At any time, a visitor may send an email to privacy@b5media.com to request that Personal Information be reviewed, changed, removed or updated in b5’s databases.

Visitors should exercise caution when they disclosed personally Personal Information in comments to blog sites, on bulletin boards or chat rooms on the Websites or any other website. Such areas are accessible by anyone and may result in the visitor receiving unsolicited messages from other people and/or companies. Although b5 is committed to protecting the Personal Information provided to it by its visitors in compliance with this Privacy Policy, it cannot guarantee the security of information, whether personal or otherwise, that visitors disclose online to publicly accessible bulletin boards or chat rooms.

Such information may include the length and date of the visit, how the visitor navigated the Websites, what pages the visitor viewed, the type of browser being used by the visitor, the type of operating system used by the visitor and the domain name of the visitor’s Internet service provider. b5 uses this Anonymous Non-Personal Information to track the success of its Websites with its visitors and to better tailor the Websites to visitors’ needs and interests. This Anonymous Non-Personal Information may be shared with other parties, such as broadcasters, advertisers, sponsors and partners. b5 may use technology and other services provided by third parties on its Websites. Those third parties may collect anonymous non-personal information from the b5 Websites, including usage data. Those third parties may use Anonymous Non-Personal Information to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. Those third parties typically use a cookie or third-party web beacon to collect this information.

Once Personal Information is no longer necessary for the purposes consented to by the visitor, b5 will delete it from its data bases or make it anonymous.
