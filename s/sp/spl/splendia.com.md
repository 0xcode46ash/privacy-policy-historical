## 4\. Information automatically collected from your computer

  * 4.1 Domain name/IP address: When you visit our Site our web server automatically detects and records your IP address. This IP address is not linked to any of your personal information. We use your IP address only to help us administer the Site.

## 5\. Cookies

  * 5.1 When you visit the Site we may store some information (commonly known as a "cookie") on your computer. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means that they cannot be used to track your movements around the web. Your credit card number is information that is not collected by cookies. Cookies help us make the most of the Site and to provide you with a more personalised service. We use cookies only for the following purposes:
  * (a) To avoid you having to re-enter your details each time you visit the Site; and
  * (b) To monitor how the Site is used in order to improve and update its content. 
  * 5.2 You can block or erase cookies from your computer if you wish (consult your browser’s instruction manual for more information). However, the correct functioning of certain parts of the Site depends on the use of cookies and therefore may not work properly if you set your browser not to accept cookies.

  * We aim to keep your personal information as accurate as possible. If you wish to review or change any information you have provided us with, please contact us by sending an e-mail to [legal@splendia.com](mailto:legal@splendia.com).



## 7\. Security

  * We have implemented all the technological means and measures necessary to safeguard your data from improper use or unauthorised access. We use secure server software (SSL) to encrypt all credit card information you provide us with before we receive it.

We strongly recommend that you carefully check the policy of each website you visit and contact its owner or operator if you have any concerns or questions.
