**_What We Collect Via Our Splunk Offerings_** **_and How We Use It_**

**_Usage Data_**. We collect and process different types of usage data when you use the Splunk Offerings to serve our legitimate business interest of improving our products and services for the benefit of our customers. We work hard to help ensure a balance between our legitimate business interests and your privacy rights.

  * **_License Usage Data_** is information pertaining to your particular Splunk Offerings. Each license is assigned a random, numeric identifier (License ID) that allows us to identify your account entitlements, such as native license group and subgroup, total license stack quota, total license stack consumption, license stack type, license pool quota, license pool consumption, etc., in our systems. License IDs also help Splunk analyze how different Splunk products are being deployed across user populations.
  * **_Aggregated Usage Data_** is information pertaining to your Splunk Offerings’ operating environment, including performance and session information. It may include such things as number of cores by type (virtual/physical), CPU architecture, memory size, storage (partition) capacity, OS/version, hardware identification, Splunk application version, number of active users, number of searches by type, number of page loads, distribution of concurrent searches, app names, page names, and page views.

This information is aggregated and used by Splunk to analyze usage patterns so that Splunk can improve its products and benefit customers. License IDs are collected initially to verify that data is received from a valid Splunk product. After the validation step is complete, License IDs are discarded from and not transferred to the collected data set used to improve the products. Likewise, User IDs are collected in connection with page view activity, but are hashed before being sent back to Splunk. Splunk uses Aggregated Usage Data extensively to help us better understand how our Splunk Offerings are being used, make improvements to them, and develop new features, or Splunk Offerings. For example, we may use this data to:  


    * Better understand how our users configure and use Splunk Offerings
    * Determine which configurations or practices optimize performance ( _e.g.,_ best practices)
    * Benchmark key performance indicators (“KPIs”)
    * Perform data analysis and audits
    * Identify, understand, and anticipate performance issues and the environmental factors that affect them
    * Improve the operation of the Splunk Offerings and develop new features and functionality
  
We use Aggregated Usage Data for the purposes described above to fulfill our legitimate business interests to develop, expand and improve the Splunk Offerings. See further below on how you can opt-out of participation in the Aggregated Usage Data program.
  * **_Support Usage Data_** is the same as Aggregated Usage Data, but the License ID persists so that the Information can be linked to your account for Splunk to analyze the performance information you send when you ask for help in troubleshooting your Splunk Offerings or to personalize your experience.



For more information about Usage Data, see our Documentation for the relevant Splunk Offering (e.g., [Share Performance Data](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.2/Admin/Shareperformancedata) for Splunk Enterprise).

**_Location Data_** is data we collect in certain Splunk Offerings (“apps” and “add-ons”, as discussed below) that associates your end users’ mobile device with an identifier for your app to help us improve the user experience. Depending on your configuration of the Splunk Offerings, it may be that location information on your end users may be shared with Splunk, however, you can disable this function should you choose, or advise your end users on how to disable the location setting on their mobile device.

**_Usage Sharing Settings_**

In our paid Splunk Offerings for software you host on your premises, you have the option of configuring the administrator settings to opt-out of providing License Usage, Aggregated Usage and Support Usage Data. For opt-out instructions, see Splunk’s Documentation (Sharing Performance Data).

License Usage, Aggregated Usage and Support Usage Data is collected by Splunk as part of offering the Cloud Service. Likewise, Splunk collects this data as part of the free or trial services we offer, but as set forth in the terms of those agreements, we discourage the uploading of production data to those environments.

In addition, on devices that enable location-based services, we may receive location information, if you consent, which you can withdraw at any time by updating your device location setting permissions. We use this information to provide personalized location-based services and content.

**_Other Collection Practices_**

We also collect Personal Data from you to fulfill our contractual commitments to you. For example, we collect contact information such as name, address (email and physical) and phone number to enter you into our customer data base systems and manage your account. This may also include Information about billing and payments, customer or support services, or software updates. We share this Information with our affiliates, vendors and partners who help us service your account and with whom we have written agreements protecting the confidentiality and security of your Information. We do not sell this Information.

**_Data Collection Practices Associated with Apps and Other Third-party Content_**

The Splunk Offerings are also extendible using software applications that we offer through splunkbase.splunk.com, called “apps” and “add-ons”. These extensions are versatile and have access to a broad set of web technologies that can be used to collect and use your Information. Additionally, some Splunk Offerings ship with a fully functional web and application server that can be extended by you or by third-party software. This Privacy Policy does not extend to third-party apps or add-ons (which may also collect your Information) even if packaged by Splunk or offered through a Splunk web property.

Splunk contractually requires third-party app developers to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws. If third-party app developers collect receive, access or transmit information about users of their apps, Splunk contractually requires the developers to provide app users with notice of the collection of such data, and to obtain appropriate consent from app users before modifying the information, disclosing the information to other entities, or using the information for purposes other than to provide the services offered by the apps. Splunk cannot guarantee that third-party app developers will comply with those requirements. When choosing to use apps, add-ons or other third-party extensions, you are entering into a license agreement with those third parties. You should familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of the organizations or individuals providing you with software that runs in or with your Splunk Offering.
