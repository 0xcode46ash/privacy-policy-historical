Splunk Inc. (“Splunk”) takes privacy seriously and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use, and disclose information. Please read the following to learn more about our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that we collect through Splunk websites, through Splunk products and services offered via a Splunk website, through Splunk software applications (“apps”), through Splunk social media pages, through email that Splunk sends to you, through Splunk-hosted events (such as promotional events, contests, sweepstakes), and through other means offered and controlled by Splunk that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Services”), in addition to information collected through Splunk’s offline interactions with our customers,

By using the Services and/or by providing Personal Information to Splunk through the Services, you agree to and are consenting to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.  Please note that your use of certain Services may be governed by separate terms and conditions entered into between Splunk and you or the organization for which you work.  Those terms and conditions may authorize different practices than those described in this Privacy Policy.  Therefore, please refer to all applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of the Services.

**Choices and Access.**  We give you choices regarding our use and disclosure of your Personal Information for marketing purposes. You may opt-out from:

We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.  Note that some access requests may be subject to a small fee.

**OTHER INFORMATION**

**How We Collect, Use, and Disclose Other Information.**  Splunk also collects information that does not reveal your specific identity and does not directly relate to an individual (“Other Information”). Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, in which case we will use it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information described above. In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined. Examples of such Other Information, and Splunk’s collection, use, and disclosure of same, include:

  * **Aggregated Personal Information.**  Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services. We may use and share aggregated Personal Information for any purpose (for example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).
  * **Device Information.**  Certain technical information is collected from the computer, device, or browser that you use to access the Services, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the Service you are using. We use this information to ensure that the Services are functioning properly, to determine whether you might benefit from a newer version of Splunk software, for troubleshooting, to improve our products and services, to analyze trends, and to understand our users.
  * **Cookies and other device identifying technologies.**  A cookie is a small data file sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your hard drive. For more information about our use of cookies and your choices to opt out of their use, click [here](https://web.archive.org/view/SP-CAAAJCY) to view our Cookie Policy.
  * **Using Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Shared Objects (“Flash LSOs”)) and other similar technologies.**  Splunk may use Flash LSOs and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the [Website Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the [Global Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html) and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Services or our online content.
  * **Pixel Tags.**  Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some parts of the Services to, among other things, track the actions of users, understand the effectiveness of our communications, compile statistics about website usage, and for the same purposes for which we use cookies. Please see our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/view/SP-CAAAJCY) for more details.
  * **Usage Data.**  When you use the Services, we and our service providers may track and collect information about how you use the Services, such as the date and time your device accesses our servers, what information and files you have downloaded, the features you use, the search queries you submit, and the amount of data you submit. We use this information internally to troubleshoot and improve our Services.  When you use the Services via a mobile device, we may associate that information with an identifier for your device.  By downloading the app you consent to this. You may opt out of such use by contacting us via the channels listed in the Contact Splunk section. 
  * **IP Addresses.**  Your IP address is a number that is assigned to the computer that you use to access the Internet. We automatically log IP addresses in our server log files whenever you use the Services, along with the time of your visit and the page(s) that you visited. Splunk uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the services, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use and to comply with applicable laws.
  * **Physical Location.**  On mobile devices that enable location-based services, we may collect the physical location of your device (determined by GPS or other signals) through your device’s operating system if you consent to us doing so. We may use this information to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.  You can restrict our access to your device’s location by managing the location-based service preferences on your device. 



**Links to Other Parties**

The Services may contain links to or facilitate access to third-party websites or online services. This Privacy Policy does not address, and Splunk is not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of these third parties, including any app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer. The inclusion of a link within the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or our affiliates. Splunk encourages you to review the privacy policies and learn about the privacy practices of those companies whose websites you choose to visit.

**Apps and other Third Party Content.**  The Splunk products and services may be extendible through the use of software applications that we offer through apps.splunk.com, called apps and add-ons. These extensions are versatile, and have access to a broad set of web technologies that can be used to collect and use your information. Additionally, some Services ship with a fully functional web and application server that can be extended by you or by third party software. This Privacy Policy does not extend to third party apps or add-ons, even if packaged by Splunk or offered through a Splunk web property. Splunk contractually requires third-party app developers to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws.  If third-party app developers collect and transmit information about users of their apps, Splunk contractually requires the developers to provide app users with notice of the collection and use of such data, and to obtain consent from app users before modifying the information, disclosing the information to other entities, or using the information for purposes other than to provide the services offered by the apps. Splunk cannot guarantee that third-party app developers will comply with those requirements. When choosing to use apps, add-ons or other third party extensions, you are entering into a license agreement with those parties. You should familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of the organizations or individuals providing you with software that runs in or with your Splunk product.

**Updates to This Privacy Policy.**

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please take a look at the “Last Modified” legend at the top of this page to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post an updated privacy policy at /r/privacy, and it will become effective as of the date of posting. Your use of the Services following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.
