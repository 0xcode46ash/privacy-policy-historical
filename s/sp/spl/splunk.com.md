# Splunk > Splunk Websites Privacy Policy

Splunk Inc. owns and operates the Splunk websites Splunk.com and SplunkForge.org. We take privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. You may also want to review our [Terms of Use](http://www.splunk.com/index.php/articles/news/8).

### Privacy Policy Scope.

This policy covers how Splunk treats information about you that Splunk collects and receives, including information related to your use of Splunk products and services.

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Splunk does not own or control, or to people that Splunk does not employ or manage. In addition, certain Splunk partners may have their own privacy policies and statements.

**Personal Information.** Splunk collects personal information when you visit the Splunk websites, join the Splunk Community, sign-up for a mailing list, request news and product information, enter contests, complete surveys or purchase Splunk products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address or phone number, and that is otherwise not publicly available. We use the personal information you voluntarily provide to register you for an account with the Splunk Community, to send information you've requested and to fulfill orders. 

When you join the Splunk Community you must provide an email address and you have the option of signing up for Splunk mailing lists. When you purchase Splunk commercial licenses, support or other services, we may add you to one or more of our mailing lists and we may occasionally contact you via email. When you enter a contest or survey, we may ask for your name, address and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. 

**Use of Personal Information.** Splunk does not sell or rent your personal information to anyone. We will only release personal information when we believe that it is required to comply with the law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Splunk, our users, or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for purposes of fraud protection and credit risk management. Please note, Splunk mailing lists may be archived by several third party sites and your email address may be found on these archive sites. Splunk doesn't have control over mailing list archive sites.

**Community Information.** Community information contributed by members of the Splunk Community, including sample data, event types, tags, comments and other information related to the Splunk Knowledge Base, may be reused by other members of the Splunk Community under terms and conditions of the Splunk [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/) License.

**Aggregate Information.** Splunk also collects aggregated tracking data when users visit our websites. We analyze visitors' use of our sites by tracking information such as page views, traffic flows, search terms and click throughs. We use this information to improve our websites. We may also share this anonymous traffic and demographic information in aggregate form with advertisers and other business partners. We do not share any information with anyone that can identify an individual user.

**Cookies.** As part of our approach to providing personalized services on our web site, Splunk uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small data file sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your hard drive that allows easier access the next time the same page is visited. For example, a cookie is sent when you sign-up or log-in to the Splunk websites. With your consent, cookies can store information from forms you fill out to create a user profile so that you do not have to re-enter the information each time you visit. If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you can configure your browser so that it notifies you whenever a cookie is received. This way you can decide each time to accept cookies or not. However, the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain features and choosing to reject cookies may reduce the functionality of the Splunk websites. Your browser should include precise instructions explaining how to control the acceptance of cookies. 

**IP Addresses.** The Splunk websites also automatically capture IP addresses. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, ensure the security of your interaction with the Splunk websites, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

**Security.** The Splunk websites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. All personal information and aggregate information is stored on a server. This server is located in a locked and guarded place and only authorized Splunk personnel have access to the database containing user names and passwords.

**Notification of Changes** If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post an updated privacy policy at <http://www.splunk.com/index.php/articles/news/7>. If we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users via email. Users will be able to opt out of any new use of their personal information. 

**Choice/Opt-Out** The Splunk websites provide users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and from our partners any time we collect personal information.
