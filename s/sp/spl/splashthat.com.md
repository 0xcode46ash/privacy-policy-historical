# Splash - Custom Event Website and Online Invitations

## Splash Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Splash. (“Splash”, “we” or “us”) on the collection, use and disclosure of your information on splashthat.com (the “Site”) and the services, applications, and other features or functionality available on or through the Site (collectively, the “Services”). Splash receives information about you from various sources, including through your user account/profile with Splash, your use of the Services, and from various third party websites and other services. When you use any of the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

  


### What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy covers Splash’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that Splash gathers when you are accessing and using the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers Splash’s treatment of any Personal Information that Splash’s business partners share with Splash or Splash shares with its business partners.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties, and their sites, services or applications, that One Clipboard does not own or control (“Third Party Services”), or to individuals that Splash does not employ or manage. While we attempt to provide access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.

  


### What Personal Information Does Splash Collect?

The information we gather from users enables them to register for our Services, and allows us to personalize those Services for those users. We collect the following types of information from our users.

  


### Sign-In Information Collected:

When you register for the Services, you will provide Personal Information, such as your name, username, password, age, and email address. You acknowledge that this information is personal to you, and by creating an account on Splash, you allow others, including Splash, to identify you. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. [You may unsubscribe from these messages through instructions on the Site.] To the extent you provide Splash with personal information, you are not anonymous to us. We will collect and record the information you provide to us.

  


### Additional Information Collected From You During Use:

You may provide us with additional information during use of the Services, such as information about your events, attendees, customers, vendors, contacts, fees and venues. Such information entered into Splash is only viewable by you. By providing email addresses or other information of non-users to Splash, you represent that you have authority to do so. All information that you enter or upload about your non-users will be covered by the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy and will enable us to provide customized services to you. This information is necessary in order for us to provide the Services to you. We disclaim responsibility for the information of non-users that you provide to us in the course of your use of the Services.

If you send us an email or other message, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request.

  


### Your Payment Information and Your Attendees’/Customers’ Payment Information:

In order to collect payments on your behalf from event attendees and customers, and provide payments to you and your vendors, we, through one or more third-party payment processors, collect payment information from you, your attendees and customers, your vendors, and other parties to whom we provide payments on your behalf and from whom we collect payments on your behalf. Such information may include names, addresses, credit card numbers, checking account numbers and PayPal account information. This information is used solely to collect and provide payments related to the Services, and is only stored by Splash’s third-party payment processors. You should review the terms of service [LINKS] and privacy policies [LINKS] of those payment processors.

  


### Your Content:

Through your use of the Services, you may provide us with content, such as branding and logos, for use along with your use of the Services. We will use and store this content only pursuant and related to your use of the Services.

  


### Personal Information Collected Automatically:

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Servics. Splash automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.

Generally, our Services automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. One Clipboard may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can improve the Services and make them as appealing to as many users as possible. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information, not information about you personally, to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use the Site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. 

  


### Email Communications:

We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us if your computer supports this type of program. We use this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and improve our service. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference during the registration process, by making a modification on your account settings page.

  


### What about Cookies?

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Splash cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of the most attractive features of our Services.

Ads appearing on the Services may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Splash and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

  


### Information to any third party ad network.

To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may include a file, called a web beacon, from an ad network within the Service. The web beacon allows the ad network to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers. Web beacons also enable the ad networks to serve ads to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

  


### Sharing of Your Personal Information Using the Services

Splash will not share your Personal Information with any other users of the Services unless you so request explicitly, either in writing, or through use of applicable features of the Services.

  


### Will Splash Share Any of the Personal Information It Receives?

Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We may share your Personal Information only as described below. 

In General: We do not use your Personal Information without your consent. However, we do combine information that we receive about you (such as gender, age, geographic location, etc.) with information about your events and activities on the Site and the Services to identify trends and other statistical information. We may use this anonymous data to provide third parties with statistics that might be relevant to the marketing and sale of their goods and services.

Non-Private or Non-Personal Information: For clarity, we may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information with advertisers, service providers, and other persons with whom we conduct business. Conversely, these advertisers, service providers and other persons may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information about you that they have independently developed or acquired. 

[Advertisers: We do not share your Personal Information with advertisers without your consent. We may allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected (including information you may have decided not to show to other users) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. Even though we do not and will not share your information with advertisers without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they selected.] 

Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: In certain situations, businesses with whom Splash becomes affiliated may sell items or provide promotions to you through the Services. In other situations, Splash may provide services, or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business, if you have agreed to be solicited by marketing partners.

Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, Splash’s agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.

Communication in response to User Content: As part of the Services, you will receive from Splash email and other communications. You acknowledge and agree that by availing yourself of the Services, you allow Splash to send you email and other communication that it determines in its sole discretion relate to your use of the Services. 

Promotional Offers: We may send you offers on behalf of other businesses. However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your name and address. [If you do not wish to receive these offers, please email us at [privacy@splashthat.com.]] [Splash – Please confirm that you will provide for an opt-out; or we can remove this section if no such e-mails will be sent.] 

Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Splash, or substantially all of its assets, were to be acquired, or in the unlikely event that Splash goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Splash may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy. 

Protection of Splash and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Splash, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information. 

  


### Is Personal Information About Me Secure?

Your Splash account Personal Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. 

Splash endeavors to ensure that user account information is kept private. However, Splash cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. 

The Services may contain links to other websites. Splash is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other websites. When linking to another website, you should read that website’s privacy policy. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Site and the Services. 

  


### What Personal Information Can I Access and Change?

You can access any Personal Information that you provide to Splash, through your account settings. To the extent information appears to be missing from your account settings pages, you may contact us at [CustomerService@splashthat.com] in order to inquire about the missing information. You will be able to, either through the Services or through contact with our customer support representatives, modify most of the Personal Information you provide to us, except for information relating to transactions you have participated in through One Clipboard that have already taken place.

  


### Deleting Your Account

Should you ever decide to delete your Splash account, you may do so by contacting us at [CustomerService@splashthat.com] or by clicking on the “delete your account” link on your account settings pages. If you terminate your account, your profile will be removed from the site and deleted from Splash’s servers. Because of the way we maintain Splash, such deletion may not be immediate, and residual copies of your profile information or posts may remain on backup media. Even after your account is terminated, Splash may retain and use certain data contributed by you, such as your transaction history, indefinitely. 

  


### What Choices Do I Have?

As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information to use, even though it may be needed to take advantage of certain aspects of the Services.

In certain circumstances, you are able to add or update certain information on pages as described in the “What Personal Information Can I Access” section above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.

You can delete your account via your account settings page. Please note that Splash will need to verify that you have the authority to delete the account, and some information may remain in our records after deletion of your account.

If you do not wish to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference during the registration process, by making a modification on your account settings page. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Service, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes. 

  


### Changes to this Privacy Policy

Splash may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Service or sending you an email. Users are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Service after such changes have been first posted.
