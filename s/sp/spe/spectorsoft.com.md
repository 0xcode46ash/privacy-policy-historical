Please see the below policy on 'opt-out' and discontinue.



**Cookies**

Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies by themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are configured to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, you will not be able to purchase software on our web site without session cookies enabled. The cookies allow SpectorSoft to manage the state of the order purchase process. Cookies may also be used to store a code that provides the customer with special price offers on SpectorSoft products and to determine from which web site a special price offer was made.

**Referers**

A Referer is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web site that you came to the Spectorsoft web site from. This Referer is automatically collected by our web server. This information is used by SpectorSoft to identify broad demographic trends about use of our site. You will not be personally identified by this information.

**IP Addresses**

IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. SpectorSoft web sites automatically collect IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information about web site use. SpectorSoft will not use your IP address to identify any personal information.

**Sharing of Information**

SpectorSoft will never sell, rent, license, exchange, or share any data about you without your permission except under the following limited circumstances: (i) if SpectorSoft is required to do so by law, or (ii) SpectorSoft has the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to applicable laws or comply with legal process served on SpectorSoft, or to protect and defend the rights or property of SpectorSoft or to enforce the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms.html)

**Tell-A-Friend**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address. SpectorSoft will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. This information is not stored by SpectorSoft and we will not contact them again using this information.

**Security**

Information collected by SpectorSoft is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. All of our employees are dedicated to maintaining and upholding your privacy and security and are aware of our privacy and security policies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, SpectorSoft cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security on our systems.

The SpectorSoft web site purchase forms ask users to enter sensitive personal information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our purchase order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.

**Special Offers**

SpectorSoft customers will occasionally receive information on SpectorSoft products, services, and special offers. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our opt-out and discontinue policy below.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information:**

If a customer's personal information changes (such as your email), we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal information provided to us. This can be done emailing our [Customer Support](mailto:support@spectorsoft.com).

**Opt-out and Discontinue**

A SpectorSoft customer may elect to avoid future communications from SpectorSoft by sending us an email at [support@spectorsoft.com](http://www.spectorsoft.com/support/unsubscribe.asp) or selecting [Unsubscribe](http://www.spectorsoft.com/support/unsubscribe.asp) and indicate your email address and request we discontinue future communications. Under urgent circumstances, SpectorSoft may be required to send you information about your software purchase, but we will not send you unsolicited communications regarding any commercial offers or advertisements if you have opted out or discontinued communications.

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
