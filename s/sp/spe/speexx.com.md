## Protection of Personal Data

We take every precaution to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal data placed on the Website or used within the Service, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully-developed security procedures. For example, when you enter sensitive personal data (such as login credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorize to access the personal data. 

## European Union Data Protection Directive

digital publishing complies with the European Union Data Protection Directive (officially Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection which regulate the processing of personal data within the European Union and Switzerland. Below, we outline our practices for implementing the Directive principals, how we collect, use and retain personal data, and the choices individuals have regarding our use of, and their ability to correct such personal data. 

## Generally

We frequently enter agreements with our EU customers to provide them our Service, which includes the processing of personal data relating to our customers’ customers. In providing our Service we do not own, control or direct the use of the personal data stored or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact we are largely unaware of what information is actually being stored on our platform and only access such information as authorized by our customers or as required by law. Only you or your customers are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such data. As such, we are only the “data processors” and not the “data controllers” of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive 95/45/EC) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Our EU or Swiss customers, who control their customer data and send it to digital publishing for processing, are the “controllers” of that data and are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Directive.

As the processors of personal information on behalf of our European customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control. In doing so we implement appropriate technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information. 

## Access and Review of Data

Residents of the EU and Switzerland whose personal data digital publishing controls may request access and the opportunity to correct, amend, or delete that data. If you are our customer and would like to gain access to, or request deletion of, information we have collected as “data controllers,” please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20141125043920id_/http%3A//www.speexx.com/en/company/global-offices.htm). We will respond to such queries within 30 business days. digital publishing has no direct relationship with its customers’ customers whose personal data it processes. An individual seeking access, or who would like to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the digital publishing customer with whom such individual interacts (the data controller). At the request of our customers we remove data within 30 business days. 

## Data Retention

digital publishing will retain personal data we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide the Service to our customers, subject to our compliance with this Policy. We retain and use this personal data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

## Enforcement

digital publishing will continuously monitor its privacy practices and continued compliance with the Directive and this Policy. 

## Children’s Personal Information

digital publishing does not knowingly collect any personal data from children under the age of 13. 

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

If we make any material changes to this Policy we will notify you by email or by posting a prominent notice on the Website prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
