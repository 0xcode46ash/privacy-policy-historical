## Cookies

**The Speedo guide to cookies**

Like most websites, Our Site use cookies to improve the way they show you things, and to make access easier for you. Cookies are small files of letters or numbers that, with your permission, "we" put on your Device. Some stay on it for a while, others disappear the minute you close the browser.

Here are the three types of cookies "we" use to help improve your experience on http://www.speedo.com/UK:

**Session cookies**  are like a token which records things like page or product selections as you move through Our Site, so you don’t keep getting asked about things you’ve already told "us". Session cookies (and the information they record) are erased when you close your browser after a browsing session.

**Tracking cookies**  help "us" remember your details and settings for when you come back to Our Site in the future, which means you get easier, faster access. They stay on your hard drive until you delete them or they expire they have various expiry dates, up to two years.

**Web analytics cookies**  help us learn what content is most helpful for our users and to make your experience of our Site much better because we’ll know the sort of things you look for and can make sure you find them easily. Cookies are small useful test files that are stored on your computer when you visit some websites. They are used to remember useful information that allows certain functionality to work, for example cookies can be used to remember what’s in your shopping basket while you browse or if you are logged in or not. Cookies cannot harm your computer, and are active for differing lengths of time. Some are stored until you close your browser, while others may last for several weeks or more. To find out more about cookies, how they work and how to manage them visit

 **No Personal Information Stored**  Remember, our cookies don’t store information that can identify you, so no one will be able to use the information gathered by the cookies to contact you by phone, email or in any other way. Tracking is limited to Our Site and never gets shared with anyone else.

**Blocking Cookies**  You can block cookies – just activate the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse them. Please note, if you block all cookies you may not be able to access all areas of Our Sites, and you might not be able to shop with "us".

**Acceptance of cookies**  If your browser is set to accept cookies, our system will issue them when you visit Our Sites – which is good because ultimately "we" want you to have the best possible experience whenever you visit Our Site.

## Where "we" store your personal details

The data that "we" collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for "us" or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.

"We" ask you not to share a password with anyone.

"We" may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1). "We" may make use of the personal data "we" have collected from you to enable "us" to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.

You have the right to ask "us" not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.

You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms "we" use to collect your data.
