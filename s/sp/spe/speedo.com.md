# Speedo - Privacy policy

Speedo takes its relationship with all our users seriously, and this includes how we handle the data you give us.

 Speedo is committed to meeting the requirements of all relevant laws and codes including the Data Protection Act 1998 and is registered with the Information Commission under registration no Z6162114 as a Data Controller. 

This Privacy Policy sets out the ways Speedo processes any personal data collected via its website. 

When do we collect personal information?  
Most of our website is free for you to browse through and read. There are a few occasions when we ask you to fill in a form and give us some information on yourself  
\- If you want to take part in a Prize Draw or Competition  
\- If you want to update your personal profile  
\- If you want to send us an email 

We only collect personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address or country of residence) if you choose to fill out a form. 

What if I am under 15?  
If you are a child under 15 and want to join we ask that you have a parent or guardian create a Speedo Family Account. By this we mean that a parent or guardian can register on your behalf using their details. We ask this so that as a child, your personal details are protected, and also to ensure that you have parental consent to take part. 

Speedo does not ask a person under 15 for more personal information as a condition of participation, than is necessary for a given promotion

 What do we do with the information?  
Providing personal information is up to you. We collect personally identifiable information to enter you in contests and notify you of results, to e-mail you with updates, news and special offers, to respond to your questions or comments, to register you for certain features on the website.

 Asking your permission  
If you register on the website we ask you to let us know if you would like receive further information or updates from us via email. We will only send you an email update if you request to receive it. We don't want to bombard your inbox, so the most number of updates we will send you is one a week - but normally it is only one every fortnight or less. (We might send you a more frequent update if a really cool event or offer is coming up that you might be interested in).

 What if you change your mind?  
We always provide you with the opportunity to opt in or out of receiving communication via email. You can do this on the website by clicking on to the Register/Log In section and selecting the ÔDelete DetailsÕ option.

 Who processes my information?  
Speedo (and those people or companies employed by Speedo who help make this site, its content and its services) use the information you tell us in order to respond to your feedback - like writing a new feature topic because you asked for it, or running a new competition.

 Beyond this, we DO NOT share your information with, or sell your information to any partner company or third party agent not involved with Speedo and the creation of this website. We make sure that if you sign up to a Speedo update, you only get a Speedo update.

 Use of cookies  
Speedo may use cookies in order to provide a better service or identify, which pages on the Website are of special interest.

Most cookies last only through one session or visit to our website. None will contain information that will enable anyone to contact you via telephone, e-mail, or any other means. You can set up your web browser to inform you when cookies are set or to prevent cookies form being set.

 What do we do to safeguard personal information?  
We have instituted safeguards to check that our internal procedures meet our high policy standards. We also use our best efforts to be sure that third parties who work with us as our agents to make this site and its contents available to you, and to fulfil your orders and requests, agree to protect personal information that they must access in order to serve our site and our visitors. We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.

 Links to other sites  
We offer links to other sites we use and recommend. However, we are not responsible for the content or information collection policies of sites operated by other companies. If you visit another site, you should review their privacy and other policies.

 Changes to our Privacy Policy  
Any changes to the Privacy Policy will be posted here.

 If Speedo wishes to make material changes to the way we use your personal information we will ask for your consent before we do so.

 Anything else I should know?  
Except as otherwise provided, Speedo will NOT disclose any information processed by us to any third party, unless required to do so by law.
