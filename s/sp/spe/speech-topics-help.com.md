We run third party advertisements through Google which are clearly identified as such. 

If you click on their ad or text link and buy something, we get a small commission. If you prefer not to do this you can also go to for example Amazon and buy direct through them in which case we would not receive a commission. Either way the product will cost you the same amount. 

We always give our honest opinions, findings, beliefs, or experiences on the topics or products we write about with the best intentions, but they are not scientificly reviewed. See [our disclaimer](http://www.speech-topics-help.com/speech-topics-help-disclaimer.html).
