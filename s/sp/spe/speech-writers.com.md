Basic Confidentiality Policy  
It is Speechwriters policy that personal information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone number, is private and confidential. Accordingly, the personal information you provide is stored in a secure location, is accessible only by Speechwriters staff, and is used only for the purposes for which you provide the information (such as to reply to your request or to process your order).

No Release of Information to Third Parties  
Personal information will not be released to third parties, unless such information is required by law. There are no other circumstances under which we will provide or sell personal information to third parties.

No Computer Tracking of Identifiable Information  
Our computer is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information about its visitors. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our sites. This information is used only for internal purposes by Speechwriters technical support staff. In addition, our web sites track information about the visits to our web sites. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.
