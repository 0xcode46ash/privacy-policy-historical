**Privacy Policy**

  
Spectranet Limited ("Spectranet"), a company registered under the Indian Company Act, 1956 is the provider of Internet enabled Broadband SMS. In order to demonstrate its commitment to the privacy of users of sms.Spectranet.com and the Broadband SMS application, Spectranet would like to present this privacy statement, to disclose its information practices and make certain commitments to users around its privacy practices.

If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should contact Spectranet's Customer Service Department by e-mail at privacy@in.spectranet.com

Spectranet and Broadband SMS treat customer information gathered from the Web site and the downloadable Broadband SMS application in the same manner. Any references in this privacy statement to:

1\. "we", "our" or "us" shall refer individually and collectively to Spectranet and Broadband SMS;

2\. "the Web Site" shall mean www.Broadbandsms.com

The Service:

Broadband SMS is an Internet enabled service ("the Service") which is made available by Spectranet, subject to various conditions detailed in the Terms and Conditions. The Web Site and the Broadband SMS application which you download in order to send messages, also form part of the Service. Through the use of the Service registered users are able to send messages to, and receive messages from, other parties . This message is delivered to the mobile phone of the recipient, or to the Internet enabled computer of the recipient if the recipient is logged on to the Service at the time the message is sent.

**Information Collection and Use** :

**Information Collection** :

Spectranet and Broadband SMS are the sole owners of the information collected from our users at several different points on the Web Site or through the Service.

**Registration** :

In order to use the Service , a user must complete the registration procedure. During registration a user is required to give his/her name, email address, mobile phone number and password. We use this information to update our database, facilitate and expedite the user's utilisation of the Service

**Payment for SMS messages** :

We request information from the user on our payment form. A user must provide contact information, such as name and e-mail address, and financial information such as credit card number and expiration date. This information is used for billing purposes, to set up the user's account, to update our database, and to facilitate the user's utilisation of the Service.

**Information Use** :

**Profiles of Customers** :

We do not store information to create a profile of our users and therefore do not share such information with other third parties. Aggregated information could be shared with third parties, but in such a manner that specific users will not be independently identifiable.

**Cookies** :

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on the Web Site. We use session ID cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. If users reject the cookie, they may still use the Web Site and the Service. The only drawback to this is that the user's utilisation of the Web Site and the Service will be limited to certain functionality.

**Log Files** :

We do not use log files. We do log certain information when users access the Web Site or the Service and this includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, platform type and date/time stamp, in order to administer the Web Site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are linked to a user's personally identifiable information but are securely stored.

**Communications from the Site** :

Special Offers and Updates:  
Registered users will occasionally receive information on products, services, updates to the Broadband SMS application, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

**Newsletter** :

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

**Service Announcements** :

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email or SMS. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their Broadband SMS account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. Users may opt-out of these communications. Please see our Choice and Opt-out section.

**Customer Service** :

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or SMS.

**Sharing** :

**Legal Disclaimer** :

Though we make every reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us.

Due to the nature of the Service and the nature of the medium of the Internet and telecommunications facilities, we cannot guarantee that information (which may include personal information) transmitted by the user to us or through the Service or to third parties, will not be intercepted by, or disclosed to, unauthorised parties during or after transmission. Similarly, when we send a message to a third party at the request of the user or as part of the Service, we also cannot guarantee that the information contained in that message will not be intercepted by, or disclosed to, unauthorised parties during or after transmission.

**Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)** :

We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any information which these parties can use to identify a specific user.

**Third Party Advertisers** :

We DO NOT share information with third party advertisers which can be used to identify a specific user.

**Third Party Intermediaries** :

We use outside credit card processing companies and banks to process payments and to bill users for services. As far as we are aware, these companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes other than for purposes of their businesses.

**Service Providers** :

We partner with partners to provide customer care services. Partners are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing users with customer care services. Messages sent by the user when using the Service may be transmitted through the facilities of third party network and service providers. These third parties are intended to be mere conduits.

**Business Transitions** :

In the event that Spectranet or Broadband SMS goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via SMS and e-mail and a prominent notice on the Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.

**Choice/Opt-out** :

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the procedures to unsubscribe which will be outlined in these communications or by sending an email to us at privacy@in.spectranet.com

**Links** :

The Web Site and the Service contain links to other websites. Please be aware that these other sites may have different privacy practices and/or we may have no control over the privacy practices of these sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the Web Site or the Service and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the Web Site and the Service.

**Surveys & Contests**:

From time-to-time the Service requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information such as name and email address. Contact information will be used by and/or shared with the contest or survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will generally be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Web Site and the services and facilities offered by us. Other than as stated above, users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, we will use reasonable endeavours to prevent the intermediary from using users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

**Tell-A-Friend** :

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about the Service, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Web Site. We do not store this information.  
**  
Security**:

We take reasonable precautions to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Service, we attempt to ensure that their information is protected both online and offline.

Users must take note, however, that due to the nature of the Service and due to the nature of the medium of the Internet and telecommunications facilities, we cannot guarantee that information transmitted by the user to us or through the Service or to third parties, will not be intercepted by, or disclosed to, unauthorised parties during or after transmission. We also have no control over the facilities and security utilised by users and/or their service and network providers. Similarly, we also have no control over the facilities and security utilised by parties to whom a user may send a message and/or utilised by the service and network providers of these parties.

When our registration and payment forms ask users to enter sensitive information, such as credit card number, that information is encrypted and is protected with recognised encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our payment form, the Verisign logo will appear.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also use reasonable endeavours to protect user-information off-line. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our customer service representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screensavers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL relevant employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every year, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.

If users have any questions about the security around the Web Site or the Service, users can send an email to privacy@in.spectranet.com

**Supplementation of Information** :

We send an SMS to a user's mobile telephone number to verify their authenticity.

**Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information** :

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as email address), we provide a way to correct or update that user's personally identifiable information. This can usually be done by emailing our Customer Service Department at privacy@in.spectranet.com

**Notification of Changes** :

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and will give notices of the changes on the homepage of the Web Site, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the Service, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on the Web Site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices..
