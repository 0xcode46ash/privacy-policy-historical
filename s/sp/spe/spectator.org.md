####  Will you rent, sell, or trade my e-mail address to a third party? 

Your e-mail address will be used by The American Spectator to e-mail news and offers that we believe will be of interest to you. Though we hope you gain value from the messages you receive, you can choose to opt-out of receiving further messages by following the instructions provided at the close of each e-mail. We also advertise on many other Internet and email outlets. Therefore you may see our advertisements in connection with other websites and email outlets. We will ensure that they offer you the ability to opt-out from their messages. 

We may from time to time send you special offers and advertisements for products or services offered by third parties. We will not disclose any of your personal information to such third parties when we do this. 

####  Do you share any other personal information with third parties? 

No, we will never share your personal information with a third party. However, we may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. 

####  What are cookies? How do you use cookies? 

Cookies are small pieces of information that your browser stores on your computerâ€™s hard drive. Cookies do not hold any personal information.

####  Do you track site usage and traffic patterns? 

Yes. By monitoring traffic patterns we learn which links and pages of the site are the most utilized. The American Spectator will then use this information to further develop the features and functionality of the site.
