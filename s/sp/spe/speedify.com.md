_Effective Date: May  28, 2014_  
_Updated April 25, 2017_

##  TL;DR: We DO NOT log what you do or what sites you visit through the Speedify service.  


Connectify, Inc. (“Connectify,” “we,” “us”) respects your privacy and as such we strive to collect the minimal amount of information necessary to operate our service. This Privacy Policy explains the type of information we collect through our website at speedify.com (the “Site”) and the Speedify service, and how we use this information to provide outstanding value to you.

By accessing and using the Site, the Speedify application, or other services owned or operated by Connectify (collectively, the “Services”), you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

## What about the Privacy of my Speedify Sessions?

 **We do not log IP addresses, sites, or data that you send or receive through the Speedify service.**

We do NOT throttle, rate-limit, monitor, record, or store the content of your Internet activities. Certain protocols, such as “torrents” or Tor, may be blocked on some or all servers. We do not log the contents of your data sent or received through the Service.

The Speedify application does not require any registration to use the service. An identifier from your hardware device may be used to generate a token to identify the session with the server.

The following user specific logging data are captured by the servers: (1) the time and network location from which an initial Speedify connection was made; (2) the amount of data transferred, and (3) the duration of the Speedify connection. This information enables Connectify to troubleshoot issues, and improve performance.

So we can furnish you with bandwidth usage reporting, and features that may require it, we may store bandwidth statistics. If you do not wish to share this information, you may turn it off from inside the application by going to the “Help Menu”, selecting “Advanced”, and then turning off the “Optimization Data” setting.

There are cases where we may require more information. This includes when you place an order, or contact our support. As appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, or credit card information.

## What Does Connectify Use This Information For?

In the cases where you provide us with personal information, such as an email address, we use this information to process and verify transactions and orders, perform and improve customer service, and to send periodic communications to our customers. For example, we may use the email address you provide to us to send you information pertaining to your order. We may also send you information about Connectify, related products or services, important notifications regarding your subscriptions or account, and other related information. Historically, these have been quite rare as we respect your time as well as your privacy.

If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails concerning offers, promotions, or other information related to marketing, you may do so from the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of our emails. Due to the nature of the Services, we must reserve the right to send you certain other non-marketing communications related to the Services with Connectify including via email.
