**A. Interest-based advertising opt-out**

We offer an “opt-out cookie” to block the placement of our behavioral advertising cookies on your system for two years from the time you opt out. When we detect our opt-out cookie on your browser, we do not serve you with interest-based advertising. The opt-out cookie is browser and device specific. Therefore, if you use multiple devices, multiple browsers or have multiple users on a single device, you will need to perform the opt-out operation for each device, browser and user. If you delete your cookies, change browsers, or use a different device, you will need to opt-out again. Browser settings that block all cookies may prevent this opt-out from operating correctly and certain privacy software may delete the opt-out cookie or cause it to function incorrectly. Furthermore, the opt-out cookie is not effective on devices that do not accept or otherwise support cookies. such as iOS based mobile devices, internet connected televisions and other non-cookie based connected devices and applications.

We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Principles regarding online behavioral advertising (otherwise known as “interest-based advertising”) (more information [here](http://www.aboutads.info/resource/download/OBA%20Self-Reg%20Implementation%20Guide%20-%20Third%20Party%20Responsibilities.pdf)). Accordingly, we offer an “opt-out cookie” to block the placement of our behavioral advertising cookies on your system for two years from the time you opt out. When we detect our opt-out cookie on your browser, we do not serve you with interest-based advertising. The opt-out cookie is browser and device specific. Therefore, if you use multiple devices, multiple browsers or have multiple users on a single device, you will need to perform the opt-out operation for each device, browser and user. If you delete your cookies, change browsers, or use a different device, you will need to opt-out again. Browser settings that block all cookies may prevent this opt-out from operating correctly and certain privacy software may delete the opt-out cookie or cause it to function incorrectly. Furthermore, the opt-out cookie is not effective on devices that do not accept or otherwise support cookies, such as iOS based mobile devices, internet connected televisions and other non-cookie based connected devices and applications.

You may install our opt-out cookie by clicking the button below:

Please note that if you choose to opt-out of interest-based advertising, it does not mean you will no longer receive advertising on the internet. However, it does mean that the display advertising you see will not be behaviorally targeted by us to your interests or preferences, so long as the opt-out cookie remains in place. Further, except for the specific restrictions noted above, our opt-out cookies do not otherwise prevent us from continuing to collect, maintain or use information as described herein.

**B. Platform and App-Based Opt-Out**

Opting out of behaviorally targeted advertisements associated with PC, mobile, or other digital platform applications (also referred to as “apps”) and internet connected devices, such as iOS- or Android-based mobile phones, internet connected televisions and other non-cookie based connected device platforms, requires a different process than opting-out of browser-based behavioral targeting. Opting-out in this context requires you to follow the process implemented by the application owner, platform device manufacturer, or third-party advertising network partners that control the placement of ads on the relevant app, device or other platform. For example, Apple and Google provide settings in the iOS and Android platforms that allow you to opt-out of interest-based advertising on your mobile device which uses such platforms. Opting out on these apps, devices and platforms is a third-party process, and we take no responsibility for the actions or inactions those third parties with respect to their respective opt-out mechanisms, if any. We encourage you to review your options and exercise your choices on such third party apps, devices and platforms.
