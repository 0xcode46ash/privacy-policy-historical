  * **II. How we use the information we collect**



**A.     Personal information you give us**

[Personal information](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-personal-information) you provide to us through the use of our corporate websites – for example, in order to sign up for an email distribution, inquire about or sign up for our services or to apply for a job with us – is generally used for the purpose for which it was provided. We may also use your [personal information](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-personal-information) in order to send you emails from time to time about our services, respond to your inquiries or in order to provide our vendors and subcontractors your [personal information](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-personal-information) in connection with performing services for us. Additionally, we may use your [personal information](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-personal-information) for other purposes permitted under this Privacy Policy, such as to protect or comply with legal rights and obligations, to complete a merger or sale of assets or for additional purposes with your consent. We may also collect [personal information](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-personal-information) on behalf of a partner that has been identified to you. In such instances, we will collect and use that information in accordance with the privacy policy that is posted at the point of collection and we will not be liable for usage of that information made by the applicable partner.

**B.     Information that we collect through your use of our and our affiliates’ services and the internet or that we otherwise receive from our affiliates and third parties**

We use the information we collect to improve our services and to deliver a more personalized web experience. This includes providing advertising and content that we believe is more relevant to you and providing more accurate analytics and reporting to our clients and partners.

The information that we collect and receive may be used for purposes including:

For example, we match [hashed](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-hashed) versions of mobile IDs to de-identified data that resides in our platform in order to target advertising to users on mobile devices.

Moreover, we may use data collected from one or more of your browsers or devices in connection with data collected from your other browsers or devices, where such browsers and/or devices are shown to be linked or related to each other (i.e., cross-device linking), for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including providing personalized advertising and ad delivery and reporting.

Because our services continually are evolving, we reserve the right to use the information that we collect for other legal purposes that are consistent with this Privacy Policy, even if not specifically described herein. We retain the right to use and disclose information that is not personal information or combined with personal information for any purpose.

**C. Public Information**

If you choose to submit content to any public area of our websites or services, your content will be considered “public” and will be accessible by anyone, including us, and will not be subject to the privacy protections set forth in this Privacy Policy unless otherwise required by law.

In order to facilitate our delivery of advertising, analytics and other services, we may use and/or share the information we collect, including [interest-based segments](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-interest-based-segments) and user interest profiles containing demographic information, location information, gender, age, interest information and information about your computer, device, or group of devices, including your [IP address](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-ip-address), with our affiliates and third parties, such as our service providers, data processors, business partners and other third parties.

**B. With third party clients and partners**

We may share information, including the information described in section III.A. above, with our clients and partners to enable them to deliver or facilitate the delivery of online advertising. We strive to ensure that these parties act in accordance with applicable law and industry standards, but we do not have control over these third parties.

Click [here](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-opt-out) for more information on opting out.

**C. To protect or comply with our legal rights and obligations**

In addition to any other uses permitted in this Privacy Policy, there may be instances when we may use and/or disclose information we collect and receive where we have, in our discretion, a good faith belief that such use and/or disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect or defend our or your legal rights or property or those of our affiliates, employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of members of the public, including responding to emergencies where there appears to be a danger of death or injury to any person; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes and to investigate potential related issues; or (iv) comply with the law, law enforcement, or legal process or proceedings or requests from public or government authorities.

**D. To complete a merger or sale of assets**

If we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of our assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of our business, or participate in any other similar business combination (including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding), we may transfer all or part of our data to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that we and any purchaser of our business or assets may continue to collect, use and disclose your information in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

**E. Upon your request**

We may also use and/or share your information, including your [personal information](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-personal-information), upon your request or instruction.

##### IV. Your choices

**A. Interest-based advertising opt-out**

We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Principles regarding online behavioral advertising (otherwise known as “interest-based advertising”) (more information [here](http://www.aboutads.info/resource/download/OBA%20Self-Reg%20Implementation%20Guide%20-%20Third%20Party%20Responsibilities.pdf)). Accordingly, we offer an “opt-out cookie” to block the placement of our behavioral advertising cookies on your system for two years from the time you opt out. When we detect our opt-out cookie on your browser, we do not serve you with interest-based advertising on the browser or device from which you have opted-out, or on the browsers or devices that we believe are linked to your opted-out browser or device. However, if you delete your cookies or begin using a new browser or device, you will need to opt out again. Browser settings that block all cookies may prevent the opt-out from operating correctly and certain privacy software may delete the opt-out cookie or cause it to function incorrectly. Furthermore, the opt-out cookie is not effective on devices that do not accept or otherwise support cookies, such as iOS based mobile devices, internet connected televisions and other non-cookie based connected devices and applications.

You may install our opt-out cookie by clicking the button below:

Please note that if you choose to opt-out of interest-based advertising, it does not mean you will no longer receive advertising on the internet. However, it does mean that the display advertising you see will not be behaviorally targeted by us to your interests or preferences, so long as the opt-out cookie remains in place. Further, except for the specific restrictions noted above, our opt-out cookies do not otherwise prevent us from continuing to collect, maintain or use information as described herein, including for non-personalized advertising purposes (such as ad delivery and reporting) on your opted-out browser or device or on linked browsers and devices.

**B. Platform and App-Based Opt-Out**

Opting out of behaviorally targeted advertisements associated with PC, mobile, or other digital platform applications (also referred to as “apps”) and internet connected devices, such as iOS or Android based mobile phones, internet connected televisions and other non-cookie based connected device platforms, requires a different process than opting-out of browser-based behavioral targeting. Opting-out in this context requires you to follow the process implemented by the application owner, platform device manufacturer, or third-party advertising network partners that control the placement of ads on the relevant app, device or other platform. . For example, Apple and Google provide settings in the iOS and Android platforms that allow you to opt-out of interest-based advertising on your mobile device which uses such platforms. Opting out on these apps, devices and platforms is a third-party process, and we take no responsibility for the actions or inactions those third parties with respect to their respective opt-out mechanisms, if any. We encourage you to review your options and exercise your choices on such third party apps, devices and platforms. To learn more about opting out on mobile devices, click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices).

**C. Unsubscribe Opt-Out**

If you would like to unsubscribe or opt-out of our use of your [personal information](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-personal-information) that you have provided to us, all such unsubscribe or opt-out requests should be sent to us at [privacy@viantinc.com](mailto:privacy@viantinc.com) and we will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. We are not responsible for removing your [personal information](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-personal-information) from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy or your consent, such as a sponsor. You should contact such third parties directly.

##### VI. Health and financial related information

We create non-sensitive health and financial related [interest-based segments](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-interest-based-segments) as part of our services, including  general [interest-based segments](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-interest-based-segments) such as “Health::Medical Centers” and “Finance::Insurance,” and custom [interest-based segments](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-interest-based-segments) such as “Health::Dieting::Acai Berry” and “Health::Contact Lens.” However, we recognize that consumers may have differing opinions regarding which data segments are sensitive.

We do not use [interest-based segments](http://www.viantinc.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-interest-based-segments) to determine credit worthiness or for insurance underwriting or employment eligibility purposes.

##### VII. Children’s privacy

We are very sensitive to the importance of children’s privacy. Our websites, products, and services are neither developed for, nor directed at, children. We do not knowingly employ or offer services or target advertising towards or collect information from children under the age of 13. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that children do not use our services and are not behaviorally targeted (i.e., we do not knowingly provide targeted advertising to partner websites whose audience is comprised of primarily children under the age of 13), we cannot guarantee that your child will not be exposed to advertising provided by us, or that we have not received information related to your child’s online activities. If you believe your child has provided us with personally identifiable information, or registered at one of our websites, please contact us at [privacy@viantinc.com](mailto:privacy@viantinc.com) to have the data provided by and associated with your child deleted.

##### VIII. Storage in the United States

This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the United States of America. Our servers are maintained in, and we control and operate our services from, the United States of America. Your information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. By using our services, you freely and specifically give us your consent to export your information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the USA, which may have different data protection rules from those of your country. A as specified in this Privacy Policy. You understand that data stored in the USA may be subject to lawful requests by the courts or law enforcement authorities in the USA.

##### IX. Data retention

The cookies that store data related to interest-based advertising expire 24 months after the last time that Viant’s ad serving system interacts with your browser or device. We store data collected and received in non-aggregate form, such as IP address and other log-level data, for up to 36 months, unless a longer retention period is required by law or is necessary to comply with regulatory audits, court orders, legal proceedings, or law enforcement requests. We retain aggregated data for longer than 36 months for purposes such as analysis, research, development and improvement of services.

##### X. Changes to Privacy Policy

We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy in order to keep up with changing user needs, enhanced technologies, and as we develop new service offerings, and we may make changes to the policy accordingly. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. When changes are made to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the “Effective Date” found at the beginning of this Privacy Policy.

If we make any material changes to our privacy practices that may impact you, we will prominently post notice of the changes on our website(s) for a period of at least 30 days. We recommend that you check the Privacy Policy frequently to inform yourself of any changes.

###### Hashed

Hashed means de-identified. Technically, a hashing algorithm is a function that converts a data string into an alphanumeric string output of fixed length. When we use “hashed” in this privacy policy, we mean a de-identified version of the data that is hashed. For example, the hashed version of “example@example.com” is: 23463b99b62a72f26ed677cc556c44e8.

Examples include “AUTO::Auto In-Market MASTER,” “TRAVEL::Travel In-Market MASTER” and “SPORTS::Sports Enthusiasts.”

###### IP address

Every computer connected to the internet is assigned a unique number known as an internet protocol (IP) address. Since these numbers are usually assigned in country-based blocks, an IP address can often be used to identify the country, and in many cases a more precise location, from which a computer is connecting to the internet.

###### Non-personal information

All forms of user information other than the personal information that you provide to us. This includes, for example, browser type, user device, operating system, IP address, performance statistics, cookie IDs, request-based information, demographic information, unique identifiers, web browsing information, performance information, session information, and log information and other similar data, whether collected by us or received from affiliates or third parties. Please see Section 1 of our Privacy Policy for a more complete description of the non-personal information we collect.

###### Personal information

This is information that you provide to us that personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, billing address and credit card information.

###### Pixel

A pixel, also known as a pixel tag or web beacon, is a small snippet of code embedded in a website. Pixels allow a website to transfer or collect information through a graphic image request. Pixels can be used count site visitations and conversions, gather broad-based user interest data, transmit to and receive information from third parties, deliver, read and write to cookies and for other purposes connected to the provision of advertising, analytics or other services.

###### Server logs

Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

###### Unique identifier

A unique identifier is a string of characters that is used to recognize a user’s device, browser or other platform. Unique identifiers may be used in conjunction with or separate from cookies, including on platforms (e.g., certain mobile devices) where cookie technology is not available.

###### User panel

Panel of internet users that agree to anonymous recording of their ad exposure activity as they browse the web and are exposed to video and display advertisements in exchange for free software and services such as browser toolbars, games, and applications that provide information services such as weather, travel, news.
