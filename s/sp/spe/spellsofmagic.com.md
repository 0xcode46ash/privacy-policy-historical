# Spells Of Magic Privacy Policy

I fully understand the desire for privacy, specially when it comes to magic. This policy is to let you know how and why we collect information from you and what we do with that information. 

_Information we collect_  
We collect standard web logs from all visitors to the website. This information includes your ip address, time of visit and the pages you visited. This information is automaticlly recorded by the web server. All web servers for all websites around the world collect this same information. Visitors who wish to contribute to the site must register and by doing so supply us with a username and a password. An email is also required to authenticate users. They will only be known by this username they select. 

Optional information may also be included but is not manditory for users wishing to post to the site. Optional information includes birthdate, your real name, occupation, email address and a picture.

Cookies are a common tool used to track visitors to websites. Your cookies MUST be enabled if you wish to post information on the website and be a registered member.

Pretty much nothing. Your information will never be sold, given away or handed over unless required to do so by law. We will never sent you mail with the exception of email in the case the website goes offline and returns online at a new address. Any information we collect is the bare minimal amount of information needed to allow a site like this to function technically or optional information which allows you to share a little bit more about yourself to the rest of the community. 

_3rd Party Cookies_  
Some 3rd parties may also use cookies to track certain bits of information. Currently, Google will place some cookies on your machine for two reasons. The first is in the ad-serving code which is used to display relevant ads to you. The second is in Analytics, which is reporting software we use from Google. This allows us to view stats on the visitors who come to the website and help us determin which features should be improved, are popular, are not popular and so on. We can not track which pages YOU visited from this information, we can only see XXXX number of people have visited specific pages.
