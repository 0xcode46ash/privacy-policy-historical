# Privacy Policy | Speck Products Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

Speck Products (“Speck,” “we,” “our” or “us”) values our customers’ right to privacy. Speck’s Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy” or “Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect, secure and use the information we gather at SpeckProducts.com (the “Website”). We will periodically update our Website without prior notice in an ongoing effort to enhance features and services for our customers. We recommend that you come back and review our Privacy Policy regularly.

### SECTION 1 – WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED ONLINE AND HOW INFORMATION IS USED

When you purchase something from our Website as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address.

When you browse our Website, we also automatically receive your computer’s Internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser, operating system and location.

By providing us with your email, you may receive periodic emails from us with new product announcements, events or promotions. If you would like to stop receiving these emails or update your information, please email us at [customerservice@speckproducts.com](mailto:customerservice@speckproducts.com) and in the subject line please write “Unsubscribe from Speck” or “Information Update”. We do not sell our customers’ email information to any third parties (except if we are required legally to do so).

We use our own cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies to help determine which of our ads are shown to you on other websites. To opt out of this targeted online advertising by Speck, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/> for more information.

We also work with third-party companies that use their own tracking technologies (including, among other things, cookies and pixel tags) on our Website in order to provide tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your activity on our sites and your interaction with our advertising and other communications. These companies use this information to determine which ads you see on third-party websites and applications. To understand your options, including how to opt out of receiving these tailored advertisements, please visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>.

Please note that even if you opt-out, these tracking technologies may still collect data and you will still see ads, but they will not be targeted based upon the information collected through these tracking technologies.

### SECTION 2 – HOW INFORMATION IS PROTECTED

To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry practices to prevent your information from being inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.

If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards.

If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then CyberSource stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through PCI-DSS. Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.

All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.

PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.

### SECTION 3 – USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

Our Website uses cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies to help enable you to shop on our Website. These tracking technologies may be used in a variety of ways to enhance or personalize your online browsing and shopping experience. These technologies may also be used to determine the ads you see on our Website and on other sites. For information about targeted online advertising and your choices related to it, please see Section 1.

For example, we may use cookies to enable you to use certain Website features, remember the items in your shopping cart, store your preferences, recognize you when you return to our Website, track your orders, and monitor and maintain information about your use of our Website. Cookies, or some other technology, may also be used to collect transaction information needed by a loyalty program to which you have authorized us to provide your personal information. We may also use our own cookies or some other technology to help determine which of our ads are shown to you on other websites.

You can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. If you do not accept cookies, however, you will not be able to access your account information or make purchases on our Website.

Cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies help us better understand your shopping needs and preferences. These technologies tell us which parts of our Website you have visited, allow us to analyze our customers’ online behavior, measure the effectiveness of our advertisements, and provide you consistent and personalized services and experiences when visiting our Website. We work with third party service providers that help us track, collect and analyze this information.

These technologies may also be used to collect “click-stream data”, which includes information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Website and our online ads.

Pixel tags or other technologies in our emails may be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us.

We may combine the information we collect through these technologies with other information we have collected from and about you and use it as described in this Policy.

### SECTION 4 – HOW TO OPT OUT

**A. How do you get my consent?**

When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we infer that you consent to our collecting this information and using it for that specific reason only.

If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.

**B. How do I withdraw my consent?**

If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at [customerservice@speckproducts.com](mailto:customerservice@speckproducts.com) or mailing us at: Speck Products, 177 Bovet Rd.

### SECTION 5 – DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES

We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.

As mentioned in Section 1, we work with third-party companies that use their own tracking technologies (including, among other things, cookies and pixel tags) on our Website in order to provide tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your activity on our sites and your interaction with our advertising and other communications. These companies use this information to determine which ads you see on third-party websites and applications.

In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.

However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.

In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.

As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.
