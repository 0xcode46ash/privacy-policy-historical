##  Our Commitment To Privacy 

Your privacy is important, to you, to us, to anyone you may come in contact with. To better inform you so that you can protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available from our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

##  The Information We Collect 

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the SPEC web site.

We do not commonly use cookies, or other session tracking methods, on this web site. However, some of our downloads ask a short survey and we do use a cookie to record whether or not the user has already completed this survey. This cookie can be refused or deleted with no ill effect other than being asked to re-fill the survey upon the next download.

Our comment and survey forms request your name and an email address that can be used to contact you.

Some pages on this site provide online forms where you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. Our product order forms require your name, company information, billing and shipping addresses, as well as email and telephone contact information.

##  The Way We Use Information 

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

You can register with our web site if you would like to receive notices on our new products and services. Information you submit on our web site will not be used for this purpose unless you specifically request to receive such material.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design and maintain our web site. For example, we do review internally which areas of our web site get visits, and at what time, and from what Internet domains. Little of this information is specific to individual behavior, we make no attempt to identify any individual's behavior, and none of this information is ever shared with any 3rd parties.

Finally, were we ever to use or share any personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above we would first provide you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

##  Our Commitment To Data Security 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

Furthermore, we do not store any individualized or sensitive data on any of our Internet servers. We do not even store any individualized financial information on any server within our domain.

##  Our Commitment To Children's Privacy 

No part of our web site is structured to attract anyone under 13. Nevertheless, protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our web site from those we actually know are under 13.

##  How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information 

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by contacting us directly, see our [contact information](https://web.archive.org/spec/contact.html). For your safety we do not keep any of this personally identifiable information online.

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows the error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. 

##  How To Contact Us 

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/spec/contact.html) or send us an email at [info@spec.org](mailto:info@spec.org).
