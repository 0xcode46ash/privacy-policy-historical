SpeedoUSA respects your privacy and, therefore, SpeedoUSA does not sell or rent the personal information you provide to us to any third party. SpeedoUSA will not share your personal information with any unaffiliated third party without your consent, unless as stated herein. 

SpeedoUSA may, from time to time, contract with unaffiliated third parties that assist us in providing our products and services to you; assist in maintaining and managing customer information to provide customer and internet services; to take and fulfill orders; to conduct SpeedoUSA promotions and surveys; or to more effectively communicate with our customers. These companies are contractually restricted from using your information in any manner, other than in helping us to provide you with the products and services available on our site. SpeedoUSA does not authorize any unaffiliated third party to make any other use of your information. 

SpeedoUSA will add you to our mailing list when you supply us with your address. Sometimes SpeedoUSA makes our mailing list available to carefully screened companies whose products and services might interest you. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please contact us via email. Include your name and address as it was supplied to us, and indicate "Do Not Share". 

If you have chosen not to receive email or postal mailings from SpeedoUSA prior to your participation in a contest, sweepstakes, promotion or survey, you may still receive information from SpeedoUSA in connection with such activity if you register for or participate in it. You may also choose not to participate in contests, sweepstakes, promotions or surveys if you do not wish to receive information about SpeedoUSA or share your information with SpeedoUSA and the other companies sponsoring such activities at any time by contacting us by either email, phone or post mail.

SpeedoUSA may disclose your information in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention, or other legal action as required by law or regulation, or if we reasonably believe it is necessary to protect us, our customers, or the public.
