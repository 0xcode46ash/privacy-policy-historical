# SpeedoUSA > Help and Info > Privacy and Security

This site was built for you and we want you to be comfortable using it. Our privacy policy is based on two principals: 

  1. Protecting Personal Information
  2. Customer Control of Personal Information



This policy is subject to change from time to time. You may want to bookmark this page for future reference.

## Protecting Personal Information

SpeedoUSA.com employs secure webservers using industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to encode and protect your data as it travels across the Internet. 

We maintain network firewalls and employ sound administration practices to protect data on our network. 

Our webservers automatically log visitor request and action information. This information may include your host Internet Protocol address (IP address). 

The SpeedoUSA.com catalog uses cookies to maintain a customer id number on your computer. Our cookies only contain a customer number and do not contain any personal information. Your personal information only resides on our servers and is protected by our security measures and your password. 

We may from time to time use your order history or other information you provide during the course of your visit to suggest specific items or promotions that you may find of particular interest. Any such promotion will not contain any of your personal information. Our purpose is to make your visit more productive. 

## Customer Control of Personal Information 

### Email address

SpeedoUSA.com's primary customer service tool is email. We request your email during the order process to allow us to provide you with the highest level of customer service by advising you of the status of your order. 

When we ask for your email during the order process, you will have the option to join our email subscription list. If you subscribe to our list, we will send you information regarding new additions to our site, special promotions, and events from us, our affiliated companies, and partners. 

You can change your email preference at any time by sending email to [Service@SpeedoUSA.com](mailto:Service@speedousa.com) and citing your email preference as either: "no email contact", "customer service only" or "subscribe to SpeedoUSA.com list". 

### Telephone Number

Your telephone is necessary to aid in order delivery. Our shippers require a phone number for all shipments. Your phone number will not be used for anything but customer service and will not be provided to anyone for marketing purposes. 

### Postal Address

If you supply us with your postal address online you may receive promotions from us. If you do not wish to receive our promotions, please send email to [Service@SpeedoUSA.com](mailto:Service@SpeedoUSA.com?subject=No%20Mail). Make sure to give us your complete name and address and specify "no mail". 

We occasionally make our customer address lists available for use by a few carefully screened firms with product we feel you may find of interest.  Should you prefer not to get their mailings, please send email to [Service@SpeedoUSA.com](mailto:Service@SpeedoUSA.com?subject=No%20Rent). Make sure to give us your complete name and address and specify that you wish not to receive any 3rd party mailings. Please provide us with your exact name, postal address, email address, and if possible, the mailing label from an order or prior mailing.

Our goal is to provide the highest level of security and privacy.
