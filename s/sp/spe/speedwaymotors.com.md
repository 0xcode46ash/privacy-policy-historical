# Privacy and Security Policy

### **Privacy**

_**What personally identifiable information is being collected?**_  
You may be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information when you visit the Speedway Motors website in order for us to provide you with the products or services that you have requested. For example, when you order a product we may ask you to become a registered user of our site. You will be asked for your shipping and billing addresses, your email address, and your credit card number or other payment-related information. If you request one of our newsletters or send an inquiry to one of our customer service representatives we will store a record of your request along with your email address. Additionaly, our Web servers track various technical details about your visit, such as your computer's IP address and which pages you visited. That information does not typically contain any personally identifiable information about you. We also collect demographic and interest information (such as age, gender and interests) about you using Google Anayltics. This allows us to present specific products and services to you based on who you are and what you like.

_**How is the information being used?**_  
The information we collect is used to provide the products and services that you have requested or in which we think that you might have an interest. It is also used to improve the content of our website, to notify you of problems with your requests, or to update you about changes to our website.

_**With whom do we share your information?**_  
We occasionally need to share information with third parties in order to operate this website and in order to provide you with the products and services you have requested. We may transmit your personal information to service providers who assist us in processing orders, shipping products, processing payment information, sending catalogs, conducting surveys, processing job applications, and sending emails and newsletters. We have agreements with these service providers that they will protect your privacy in accordance with our standard Privacy Statement. Some of those organizations may have their own privacy statements which may give you additional protections. You are encouraged to read those statements when presented.

_**How do I access, update, or delete my personally identifiable information?**_  
If you are a registered user of the website, you can manage many aspects of your registration information. For security reasons, however, some parts of your personal information may not be changed online and may require you to call or write to us in order to verify your identity before changes can be made. The online registration area will also permit you to exercise control over the use of your email address, allowing you to opt-out of future email messages from this website. Due to various legal and recordkeeping requirements, however, we may be required to maintain records about your purchases or other activities on this website. However, you will always be permitted to opt-out of any marketing uses of your personal information. If you prefer to manage your personal information via other means, you may contact us by postal mail at:

_**What information will be disclosed if required by law?**_  
If required by law, we may provide any and all information we have about you to law enforcement or other government agencies, pursuant to a subpoena, warrant, or other order by a court of competent jurisdiction. In all cases, we will require written documentation of the request, proof of the identity of the law enforcement official making the request, and we will take steps to authenticate the validity of the request. Any law enforcement or government agency request submitted with less than a court-issued order will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to the need and urgency as well as the particular law enforcement agency making the request.

_**What are cookies and how do we use them?**_  
A cookie is a block of text placed in a file on your hard drive by a website you've visited.

Speedway Motors uses cookies to observe our site visitor's navigation throughout the site. This helps us identify ways to improve the shopping experience.

The shopping cart cookie is saved for a designated period of time in case your session expires or if you return to complete a purchase within that time frame.
