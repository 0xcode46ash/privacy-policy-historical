# Privacy

All content uploaded to the Service is your own private property. Struktur will not read, change, destroy or forward the contents of your account, unless entitled to do so by this Agreement or forced to do so by law, regulation or any extraordinary circumstance.

Struktur will not share with, sell or transfer any data or personal information provided to us through usage of the Service to any third party without prior and explicit consent.

Note according to ยง 33 BDSG (Federal Data Protection Act): Storing and processing licensee data is carried out by Spreed and neutral service providers commissioned by us in strict accordance with the federal data protection act.

By making content public on your meeting schedule or profile you give an explicit consent to show the information chosen to the audience specified. Your first name, last name, company, country of origin stored in your own account profile, the title of your published conferences, presentations, and shared files are visible to other users by default. It is your responsibility to ensure that making public that information does not violate their privacy or any other regulations, and only happens when that person has given his explicit consent.

You also agree that the Service cannot be used to store, upload, or publish any sensitive information about yourself such as matters of race, ethnic background, religion, philosophical conviction, health, sexuality, labor union membership, criminal offences, social problems and other strictly private issues.

Like most web sites, Struktur uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your PC which allows Struktur to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the same PC and web browser.

As an effect of standards on the web, when you visit the spreed.com we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Spreed. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is only used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Service. The link between this information and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.
