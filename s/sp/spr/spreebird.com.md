**SPREEBIRD** ™ **Privacy Policy**

_Last Updated: March, 2010_

This SPREEBIRD privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) discloses the privacy practices of the SPREEBIRD website (collectively the “Website” located at [www.spreebird.com](http://www.spreebird.com/)) regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information you (the “User” or “End User”) submit to SPREEBIRD (“SPREEBIRD”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) through our Website. 

In accessing the Website, you acknowledge that you agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Website Terms of Service (see <http://www.spreebird.com/terms>).  If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please exit this page and do not access or use the Website.  Please note that we may update this Privacy Policy as we change or develop the Website or our services associated with the Website.  If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes within this privacy statement and to other places we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion, so that you are aware of such changes.  Upon any changes to this Privacy Policy, your continued use of the Website constitutes your acceptance of the additional or reduced terms.  Therefore, please review this Privacy Policy frequently. 

**1.      ** **Information We Gather**

We collect two types of information on our Website from our End Users: personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) about you, including, but not limited to your name, e-mail address, physical address, and telephone number, and “Non-Personal Information”, which is information that does not permit you to be identified as an individual person. 

_Personally Identifiable Information_

We do not collect any Personal Information about you without your permission when you use our Website and its services.  Some features of our website do not require you to register for an account or provide any Personal Information to us.  However, you may be asked to submit Personal Information when you engage in some activities on our Website including, but not limited to, creating an account, ordering a product or service from us or our partners, sending us feedback about our services, or signing up for special offers on our Website (collectively, “Identification Activities”).  Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask to receive from you may be identified as mandatory, while other information is voluntary.  If you do not provide mandatory information for any particular activity or aspect on our Website where it is required, you will not be permitted to access that area of the Website or participate in that activity. 

_Referral or “Tell-a-Friend” Services_

We offer the ability for you to refer your friends to our Website or to buy deals for your friends as well.  To perform these functions, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  Your friend will then automatically receive a one-time email with either the gift you bought for him or her or an invitation for your friend to visit our Website.  We will keep the information you provide us to perform your email request, send a voucher, or monitor the performance of our referral program.  Your friend may request that we remove the information you provided by contacting us at [privacy@spreebird.com](mailto:privacy@spreebird.com). 

_Non-Personal Information_

Non-Personal information (“Non-Personal Information”) is information that does not identify you as a specific End User.  This information may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, your browser type, browser language, operating system, the date and time of your access to the Website, and your immediately preceding and subsequent URL visitor history.  When you visit our Website, a cookie that uniquely identifies your browser may be sent to your computer.  A “cookie” is a small file containing your preferences that is sent to your browser and returned by your browser each time your access our Website.  Cookies that we may use may only be read by the server that placed them there.  Most browsers are set up to allow cookies.  If you would like more information about cookies and how to control and delete, or “opt out” from cookies in various browsers, please click here. 

We may also use the services of a web analytics company to help us measure the effectiveness of our Website, including the advertising on the Website. To do this, we may allow a web analytics company to include web beacons and cookies on the Website. The type of information collected via such web beacons and cookies includes search terms, search parameters, click-throughs by users, and other similar information. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like user preferences, popular search categories, click-through rates, how to improve our Website, and what kinds of offers our users like to see. Although our web analytics company logs this information on our behalf, we control how that data may be used. 

Additionally, Non-Personal Information may be used to serve most, if not all, of the advertisements appearing on the Website by one of our Web advertising partners ("Ad Serving Partners"). In the course of delivering such advertisements, our Ad Serving Partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Thereafter, information about your visits to the Service, such as your search terms or phrases or the number of times you have viewed an advertisement (but not your name, address, or other Personal Information), is used to deliver advertisements to you. The information collected by our Ad Serving Partners through cookies is anonymous, and our Ad Serving Partners are not authorized to collect any Personal Information about you. For more information about cookies, and how to "opt-out" of cookies from certain Ad Serving Partners, please click here. __

**2.      ** **Use of Personal Information**

As a general rule, we do not share the Personal Information we collect from you or any other End Users with third parties.  We will only share such Personal Information in the circumstances below. 

_Merchants_

Our Website may provide deals and offers from both: (i) third party deal providers and; (ii) individual merchants (“SPREEBIRD Merchants”) who, as part of their offers on our Website, request information on our customers who purchased the offer in order to aid redemption.  In the instance of purchases from SPREEBIRD Merchants, we share some of your Personal Information.  The SPREEBIRD Merchants will then have the opportunity to market directly to you through use of such information.  However, this Personal Information will only be shared with SPREEBIRD Merchants once you provide it through an Identification Activity and such information will only go to that specific SPREEBIRD Merchant.  SPREEBIRD disclaims any liability or responsibility from the actions of such SPREEBIRD Merchants or third party deal providers regarding the use of your Personal Information as we do not have any control over their actions. 

_Authorized Third Parties_

Some of the services and products on our Website are from third parties.  These “Authorized Third Parties” perform limited functions on our behalf, like sending out promotional emails of offers on our Website.  We may share your Personal Information with those Authorized Third Parties to fulfill orders, deliver packages, send postal or email, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, process credit card payments, troubleshoot, and provide customer service.  For example, during a transaction, we will disclose your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm your payment, and will sometimes release your address to the delivery service to confirm delivery, if necessary.  We encourage all of our SPREEBIRD Merchants and Authorized Third Parties to provide privacy policies.  However, their use of your Personal Information is governed by those third parties and is beyond our control. 

_Public View on our Website_

Your feedback, comments, questions to us or other users, answers, and other contributions on the Website, and metadata about them (such as when you posted them), may be publicly viewable on the Website. We will not ask for any Personal Information, but please be aware that if you provide Personal Information in the content you provide, such content may be visible for public view on our Website. 

_For Our Protection and the Protection of Third Parties_

We may disclose Personal Information if it is required by law, necessary to defend our legal rights or enforce our policies, or if we in good faith believe it is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity in which you may be involved (or are reasonably suspected to be involved), even without a subpoena, warrant or court order.  Such Personal Information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 

_Business Transactions_

We may share your Personal Information in the event that we go through a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets.  You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted, and that the acquirer of such Personal Information may continue to process or use such information in accord with the uses provided under this Privacy Policy. 

_Common Control_

We may share some or all of your Personal Information with SPREEBIRD affiliated companies that are under a common control, in which case we require such affiliated companies to honor the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

**3.      ** **Use of Non-Personal Information**

As noted in Section 1, web analytics companies may be used to help us measure the effectiveness of our services on the Website or to develop effective advertising campaigns.  Additionally, Ad Serving Partners may also use this Non-Personal Information to serve advertisements to you through our Website.  Please note that this information will not be used in any way to identify you as a specific user, and note the link posted above that shares more information on cookies. 

**4.      ** **Third Party Viewing of Your Information**

When you use our Website, certain information you provide through us, such as your name, profile, comments, and reviews, may be shared with or visible to other users on publicly available portions of our Website.  Please remember that if you choose to disclose Personal Information when posting comments or other information or content on our Website that this information may become publicly available and may be collected and used by others.  We disclaim all obligations with respect to any information that you provide on parts of our Website that are available to others.   Please use caution when giving out Personal Information to others on our Website or otherwise. 

#####  5.     Accessing, Reviewing, and Changing Your Personal Information 

If you have an account with us, you have the ability to review and update your Personal Information online by clicking on a "My Account" link (or similarly named link) on the Website and logging into your account. You can also review and update your Personal Information by contacting us at [privacy@spreebird.com](mailto:privacy@spreebird.com).  You must promptly update your Personal Information if it changes or is inaccurate. We do retain Personal Information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our terms and conditions, and take other actions permitted by law. 

**6.      ** **Your Choice on Collection and Use of Information**

You may always choose not to provide personal information, although some may be required to engage in certain activities on the Website.  As a condition of purchase of the products or services on the Website, we will send you administrative and promotional emails.  These emails will contain information regarding your account activity on the Website and your purchases as well as promotional updates on our Website.  You must receive “Administrative Emails” as they relate to your activity on the Website.  However, you do not have to receive “Promotional Emails”.  Promotional Emails are those that advertise our products and services, including exclusive offers found only on our Website.  To opt out of receiving our Promotional Emails, please email us at [unsubscribe@spreebird.com](mailto:unsubscribe@spreebird.com), or unsubscribe to our emails by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any of our Promotional Emails. 

**7.      ** **Data Security**

We recognize our responsibility to protect the Personal Information you entrust to us. We restrict access to your Personal Information to authorized employees, and consultants. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your Personal Information. While we take precautions against possible breaches in our Service and customer databases, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. Your use of our Website is at your own risk. We urge you to take steps to protect your Personal Information when you are on the Internet by changing your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure Internet browser. 

**8.      ** **Privacy Policies of Third Party Websites**

Certain of our partners or affiliates that are accessible through the Website (i.e. third party deal providers or merchants) may also collect information from you, including Personal Information. Such third party websites may send their own cookies to end-users, collect data, or solicit Personal Information from you. We have no control over those websites and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites, including their use of any information collected when our end-users click through to such websites. If you are concerned about the privacy policy of a certain third party, we strongly encourage you to contact them directly or visit their individual websites to learn more about their individual privacy policies. ****

**9.      ** **Miscellaneous Privacy Issues**

_Children_

Our Website is not directed or to be used by children under the age of 18.  We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from anyone under the age of 18.  We do not sell products for purchase by children.  In certain instances, we sell children’s products for purchase by adults.  Parents may request a review and/or removal of their child's Personal Information at any time by contacting us at [privacy@spreebird.com](mailto:privacy@spreebird.com) and providing us with the same screen name, password, and e-mail address that their child submitted. To protect the child's privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify the parent's identity before granting him or her access to the child's Personal Information. 

_Facebook_

Our Website allows users to access Facebook Connect to interact with friends and share on Facebook through Wall and friends’ News Feeds.  If you are logged into SPREEBIRD and Facebook, when you click on “Connect with Facebook” your profiles will merge if the email addresses match.  If the email addresses do not match, we ask you if you want to merge them and then you must enter your SPREEBIRD password to validate that they control that account.  If you are already logged in to SPREEBIRD but not Facebook, when you click on “Connect with Facebook” you will be prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to “Sign up for Facebook.”  By proceeding, you are allowing us to access your information and you are agreeing to Facebook Terms of Use in our Website. 

However, if you are not currently registered as a SPREEBIRD user and you click on “Sign in Using Facebook”, you will be first asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join SPREEBIRD.  Once you register on the SPREEBIRD site and Connect with Facebook, you will be able to automatically post recent activity to Facebook.  You have the option to disable Facebook Connect at any time by logging into “My Profile” and clicking on “My Facebook Profile.”  Further, you can edit privacy settings for the reviews that appear on Facebook or disconnect this service by visiting the Facebook Application Settings page.

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits end users who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send us an e-mail at [privacy@spreebird.com](mailto:privacy@spreebird.com) or write us at: Local.com Corporation, 7555 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine, CA 92618, Attn: Legal Department.
