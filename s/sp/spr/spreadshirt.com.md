## Spreadshirt Orders and Membership

The usage of personal data for other appropriate purposes is dependent on prior consent from the user. 

If a user agrees to the forwarding of newsletters from a shop owner, then they will receive the newsletter content via Spreadshirt. The shop owner sends the newsletter information to Spreadshirt and a transmission of the users personal data to the shop-owner does not take place without the user’s express consent.

We anonymize (hash) the email addresses we submit to Customer Match. We do not use all customer or user email addresses for the Customer Match service, so your email address may not be used at all. You may be able to opt-out of this use by [adjusting your Google ads settings](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en). Only Google receives the anonymized email addresses, and Google does not use them for any other purposes.

## How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in most web browsers. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, we and many other digital service operators do not respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit [http://allaboutdnt.com](http://allaboutdnt.com/).
