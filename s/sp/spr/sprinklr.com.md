# Privacy | Social Media Management System

_This policy is effective as of June 26, 2013._

Sprinklr is a social media management system (a “SMMS”). The Sprinklr system is a tool that enables companies and organizations, or Sprinklr “Customers”, to process and manage publicly available information about their brand on the Internet.

This means that the Sprinklr system aggregates and saves a record of public information that is available about your interaction with a company or organization on the Internet.

Sprinklr proactively encourages each Customer to engage in privacy best practices. While Sprinklr cannot guarantee that is Customers will abide by the best practices in user privacy, it does its best to make sure that everyone that is a part of its ecosystem is aware of those practices and has received concrete guidance concerning implementation. Of course, Sprinklr Customers are responsible for their own use of the Sprinklr platform. Please review the Customer’s individual terms of service and privacy policies for information on their privacy practices.

**To learn more about Sprinklr’s privacy practices, please see our full Privacy Policy** **.**

Although the information collected within our platform is primarily publicly available, Sprinklr complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from the European Union (concerning our Customers whose use of the Sprinklr system may constitute a cross-border transfer of data). The following are Sprinklr’s promises to each Customer:

1)      **Notice.** When Sprinklr collects your personal information, we give you timely and appropriate notice describing what personal information we are collecting, how we will use it and the types of third parties with whom we may share it. This notice is located in this policy. Sprinklr has advised its Customers to provide similar notice to their unique customers and partners of their use of the Sprinklr system.

 2)      **Choice.** Sprinklr will give you choices about the ways we use and share your personal information, and we will respect the choices you make. Please recognize that Sprinklr is a system used by Customers and, as such, we advise and encourage our Customers to take appropriate action with respect to their own privacy standards as it relates to social media management.

 3)      **Relevance.** Sprinklr will collect only as much personal information as is required to meet the specific, identified purposes of Customer contracts, and we will not use it for other purposes without obtaining your consent.

 6)      **Access.** Sprinklr will provide ways for you to access your personal information as quickly as possible upon request, as required by law, so you can correct inaccuracies.

 7)      **Security.** Sprinklr will take appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration and destruction. Sprinklr and its Customers enter into agreements requiring that Sprinklr use the highest industry standards with respect to storage of data and the security of its system.

 8)      **Sharing.** Except as described herein, Sprinklr will not share your personal information with third parties without your consent. As standard policy, Sprinklr’s Customer agreements prohibit the sharing of information beyond communication with a specific Customer.

 9)      **International Transfer.** If Sprinklr is used to transfer your personal information to another country, Sprinklr will take appropriate measures to protect your privacy and the personal information transferred.

 10)     **Enforcement.** Sprinklr will regularly review how we are meeting these privacy promises, and we provide an independent way to resolve complaints about our privacy practices (see below).

Sprinklr complies with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework set forth by the Department of Commerce in addition to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor program. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Sprinklr’s certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

Sprinklr Customers use the platform to perform functions with the system as outlined above. Sprinklr has provided each of its Customers with suggested guidelines, _Sprinklr’s Privacy Guidelines for Customers_ , which fall in line with the Sprinklr policies that are outlined in this document.

**The Content the Sprinklr Platform Allows Customers to Index**

_Sprinklr_   _is a social media management system that lets companies manage and measure social media content. A monitoring dashboard enables users to track keywords, influencers and competitors. Dashboards can be shared across the organization to improve operational efficiency._ The intent of Sprinklr is that the information that Sprinklr is indexing can be found by anyone online using a search engine.

Sprinklr’s Customers use the Sprinklr system to aggregate publicly available content on the Internet. This includes, but is not limited to:

  * Twitter;
  * Facebook;
  * YouTube;
  * LinkedIn;
  * Google+;
  * SlideShare;
  * Instagram;
  * Vkontakte;
  * Sina Weibo;
  * RenRen; and
  * QQ.



**Sprinklr does not circumvent any of your personal privacy settings on any of the platforms that it indexes content from. The Sprinklr system is intended for the use of publicly available information. Sprinklr does not bear responsibility for its Customers use of the platform with non-public information. Sprinklr has implemented security practices to account for this use of the platform as a safeguard.**

**How Sprinklr Uses Your Content**

Sprinklr is a social media management system deployed and used primarily by its Customers. As such, Sprinklr’s Customers are the ones who are indexing content using the Sprinklr tool. Sprinklr requires each one of its customers to sign agreements with Sprinklr that align with Sprinklr’s privacy practices. We also require as part of these agreements that Sprinklr Customers agree to abide by the policies of third-party websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as comply with all US, European Union, Swiss and Canadian privacy laws.

**Communication**

The Sprinklr system allows its Customers to communicate with Internet users who post content publicly on social networking services and other sites. Again, Sprinklr customers are given privacy guidelines for these types of communications and agree to abide by the policies of third-party websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as comply with all applicable US, European Union, Swiss and Canadian privacy laws. 

Any private communications between Sprinklr Customers and Internet users through the Sprinklr platform are maintained in accordance with the Sprinklr Terms of Service.

**Monitoring**

The Sprinklr platform allows Customers to monitor Internet users who interact with the Customer through publicly available content.

For example, if an Internet user Tweets about the fictitious brand “Joe’s Shoes” and their Tweets are set to “public” in their Twitter privacy settings, Joe’s Shoes would have the ability, by using the Sprinklr system, to track this Internet user to determine if these actions and sentiments lead the Internet user to become a customer, make a purchase or in some other ways interact with the Joe’s Shoes brand.

**Targeting**

The Sprinklr platform also allows its customers to post advertisements and campaigns. _Sprinklr’s Privacy Guidelines for Customers_ provides guidelines for use of this feature so that it may be used in compliance with the Federal Trade Commission’s _.com Disclosures_ guidelines to avoid engaging in unfair and deceptive marketing practices. Sprinklr urges all of its Customers to be as transparent as possible in their use of the Sprinklr system.

**Accessing Your Information Stored on the Sprinklr Platform** ** **

You have the right, upon written request, to access the publicly available information that Sprinklr processes. If such content is found, Sprinklr will inform you about such content (limited by others’ privacy interests or legal rights), how it is being used and other information as required under applicable law. This obligation is only in relation to content that is directly held by Sprinklr, not in any information that is held by its Customers and not Sprinklr.

Choice
