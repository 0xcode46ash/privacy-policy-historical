# Sprinkle | Privacy Policy

## PRIVACY AND COOKIE POLICY FOR OUR CONTENT RECOMMENDATION AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICE

This privacy policy applies to information collected through the Sprinkle content recommendation and distribution service, i.e. our widgets, video players and sponsored messages installed at our publishing partners’ web pages, (collectively, the “Service”). The Service is offered by Sprinkle Holding AB and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Sprinkle,” or “we”, “us”, “our”).

We take your privacy very seriously and are committed to being transparent with how we use your information.  Our privacy policy explains:

  * Why we collect information
  * How we collect information
  * What type of information we collect
  * How we use that information
  * Your options to restrict Sprinkle from accessing information



The Service contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of third party websites.

**Why we collect information**

We collect information to provide better content recommendation services to our users and better targeting for our advertisers.

**How we collect information**

We collect information on all pages where the Service is installed.  We track what articles are read and what content items in our widgets are clicked.

We use cookies to identify a user from one page load to another only to optimize what content to recommend on the following pages.

We never collect information that can be used to identify a specific individual.

**What type of information we collect**

We may collect information about what content categories you access when visiting websites where our Service is installed. The system is based on a number of content categories; for example Sports or Travel. The only information that is saved in an anonymous cookie is a counter showing the amount of times a certain category of a website has been visited and the time of the latest update of the counter.

No categories relating to information which Sprinkle considers sensitive have been or will be created, such as categories relating to political opinions, religious beliefs, physical or mental health conditions or sexual life. Further, Sprinkle is very sensitive to the issue of children’s privacy and marketing directed to children. No categories are intended for the profiling of children.

We may also automatically collect certain technical information such as, but not limited to, device information and IP-address.

**How we use the information we collect**

We use this information to offer you tailored content like giving you more relevant content recommendations.

We may collect and share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our business partners such as advertisers, publishers and content providers.

We never make individual user data available to any third party.

**Your options to restrict Sprinkle from accessing information**

You can opt out of having us track and collect your personal information by clicking on the opt-out button on the profile page. You can also choose to clear the cookie from all information we have collected by selecting the clear-button.

_Note that if you clear all cookies from your browser, you will also clear the cookie that tells us you have opted out so you will have to opt out on this page again._

You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our Service. This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites and services, including this one.

**Policy amendments**

We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time by posting a new version on our website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy with any changes.
