# Sprout . Privacy

**Privacy**

Sprout is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement applies to the data collected by Sprout through the Sprout site (the "Site"); it does not apply to data collected through other online or offline Sprout sites, products or services.

**Collection of Your Personal Information**

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you. The personal information we collect may include names and email addresses.

To sign in to the Site, you will be asked to enter an e-mail address and password, which we refer to as your Sprout credentials. We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with the Site. We also collect certain standard information such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses.

**Use of Your Personal Information**

The personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized.

In support of these uses, Sprout may use personal information to provide you with more effective customer service; to improve the Site and any related Sprout products or services; to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; and to display content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.

We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications. Additionally, with your permission, we may send you information about other Sprout products and services, and/or share information with Sprout partners so they may send you information about their products and services.

Sprout may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as Web site hosting, packaging, mailing and delivering prizes, answering customer questions about products and services, and sending information about our products, special offers, and other new services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Sprout may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Sprout or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Sprout and our family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Sprout products or members of the public.

Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Sprout or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

**Children under 14**

This is not a website directed to children under the age of 14, and Sprout does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 14 years of age. If you are under 14 years of age you should not use this website, and under no circumstances should you send information about yourself to Sprout. If Sprout discovers that a child under the age of 14 has provided Sprout with personally identifiable information, Sprout will immediately delete that child's personally identifiable information from the website.

**Control of Your Personal Information**

Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide on the Site will not be shared outside of Sprout and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission.

**Access to Your Personal Information**

You can review and edit the personal information you provided at this Site by accessing your personal setting page which can be found by following the "Settings" link which can be found in the top navigation panel when signed in.

**Security of Your Personal Information**

Sprout is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

**Use of Cookies**

We use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of the registration process and to personalize the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to use interactive features of this or other web sites that depend on cookies.

**Use of Web Beacons**

Sprout Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

Sprout may also employ Web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics and determine the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We prohibit Web beacons on our sites from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal information.

**Changes to this Privacy Statement**

We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For material changes to this privacy statement, we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice on the home page of our web site or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates.
