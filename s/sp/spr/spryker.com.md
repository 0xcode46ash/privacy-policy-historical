**8\. Uses of LinkedIn Social Plugins**

Our website uses the social plugins (“plugins”) of the linkedin.com social networking site (“LinkedIn”) operated by the LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. The button can be identified by the “LinkedIn-Logo” or “Share-Button” on this webpage. When a user accesses a web page on this site that features one of these buttons, the browser establishes a direct connection with LinkedIn’s servers as soon as the LinkedIn button is pressed. LinkedIn then transfers the content of the “in” button directly to the user’s browser, which integrates the content into the web page. The provider has no control over the amount of data that LinkedIn collects via the button after the user clicks on it. Thanks to the integration of the plugin, LinkedIn knows that you have accessed the relevant page of our website. If you are logged in to LinkedIn, LinkedIn can recognize you based on your LinkedIn account and record your visit. If users want to find out what data LinkedIn collects about them and why, how it processes and uses their data, and what rights and settings they can assert to protect their privacy, they should refer to LinkedIn’s data protection policy.
