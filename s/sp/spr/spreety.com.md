# Spreety Membership - About Spreety

Spreety is a free internet entertainment guide. The core focus of Spreety is on high production quality U.S. video and audio content that is presented with a positive internet experience. 

Spreety links to ABC for ABC shows, CBS for CBS shows, etc., for the highest quality, legal experience. While Spreety is free, some of the links are marked with a $ to indicate pay-for sevices. 

For most, Spreety is a useful way to catch a missed TV episode or revisit an old favorite. For some, Spreety may replace the DVR and/or cable TV. 

As a preferred directory, some internet content does not appear, such as promotional clips or incomplete storylines. The goal with such editing is to provide a concise, quality experience for our members. 

For advertisers, Spreety accepts ad placements via direct contact. For details, contact us at [spreety@sbcglobal.net](mailto:spreety@sbcglobal.net). 

Thank you for visiting Spreety!
