## 7\. Social Plugins

  1. **Facebook Social Plugins**




Springerlink uses so-called social plugins ("plugins")of the social networking site facebook.com provided by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). The plugins can be identified by one of Facebook’s logos (white "f” on blue tile or a "thumps-up”-sign) or by the additional text "Facebook Social Plugin”. The list of Facebook Social Plugins and their appearance can be accessed via: [http://developers.facebook.com/plugins.](http://developers.facebook.com/plugins)

If a user visits one of the websites using such a plugin, the user’s browser directly connects to Facebook’s servers. The plugin and its content are made available directly on Facebook’s servers and included in the website by the user’s browser. For this reason, the provider of the website cannot influence which data Facebook connects via the plugin and thus informs the user according to his own knowledge. 

Due to the integration of the plugin Facebook collects the information that a user is visiting the corresponding website. If the user is logged in on Facebook at the moment he or she visits the website, Facebook may be able to connect the visit on the website to the user’s Facebook account. If the user interacts with the plugin – for example if he or she presses the like button or comments on something – the user’s browser transmits this information to Facebook. Facebook stores this information. If a user is not a member of Facebook, Facebook may collect and store the user’s IP-address. Facebook states that it only collects anonymized IP-addresses in Germany. 

The reason for and scope of the data acquisition and information about the way in which the data is processed and used by Facebook, as well as the user’s rights in this respect and settings options for protecting the users privacy can be found under: [http://www.facebook.com/policy.php.](http://www.facebook.com/policy.php)

If the user is a member of Facebook and does not wish Facebook to collect personal data via this homepage and to link this with his data stored on Facebook, the user needs to log off from Facebook before going to this homepage. 

The user may also block Facebook’s plugins using add-ons for the user’s browser, for example the "Facebook Blocker".

If a user visits one of the websites using such a plugin, the user’s browser directly connects to LinkedIn’s servers. For this reason, the provider of the website cannot influence which data Facebook connects via the plugin and thus informs the user according to his own knowledge. 

Due to the integration of the plugin LinkedIn gathers the user’s IP-address. If the user is logged in on LinkedIn, he can link articles or a website of this homepage to his LinkedIn-profile. In this case, Twitter can connect the visit on the website to the user’s LinkedIn account
