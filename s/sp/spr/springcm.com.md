## How Do We Protect Your Information?

SpringCM places a high value on the corporate data and document data you entrust with us. For this reason, we secure your information at three levels: physical, application, and network layers. The physical layer is protected by need-to-know authorization by only the appropriate operations individuals. Additionally, the servers are caged within a room only accessible through biometric scanning. The application layer is entirely secured with VeriSign’s Site Trust 128 bit SSL encryption technology so all communication with the website is locked. The network layer is protected by industry-leading firewall technology and administered real-time to ensure timely security patching. This layer is also watched by intrusion-detection systems to ward off unauthorized access. These safeguards all are put in place to protect our users’ information, prevent unauthorized access, safeguard user data, and ensure the proper and legal use of the Site. SpringCM takes commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect customer-specific information transmitted via or stored on our Site. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee that information users supply will be totally secure.

In addition, when you initiate a transaction on a Web site that our Site links to, even if you reached that site through our Site, the information that you submit to complete that transaction becomes subject to the privacy practices of the owner of that linked site. You should read their privacy policies to understand how they use and protect personal information that they collect.
