A Web Beacon is an electronic image (1x1 .gif) located within a certain web page.  In some cases, Springleaf Finance may use a Web Beacon to analyze traffic and transactions on its website.  No personally identifiable information about you, such as your name or social security number, is collected by any Springleaf Finance Web Beacon. 

In cases where you may enter the Springleaf Finance website from a third party site, such as a search engine or referral site, those sites may use Cookies and/or Web Beacons to monitor their own performance, traffic, etc.  Springleaf Finance does not allow these third-parties to collect personally identifiable information about you, such as your name or social security number, with their Cookies or Web Beacons. 

Third party vendors, including Google, show our ads on the internet.  Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads on a userâ€™s prior visits to our website.  You may opt out of Googleâ€™s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page. 

Your browser should allow you to manage Cookies, and it may allow you to manage Web Beacons, used by various websites.  However, if your browser's settings are too restrictive you may not be able to use all of the features of a Website, including Springleaf Finance's website. 

**_Can I confirm that the information Springleaf  Finance collects is correct?_**

  * Keeping your account information accurate and up to date is very important. If you ever have questions or issues with the accuracy of your nonpublic personal information, please contact us at the following phone number or write us at the following address: **** 1-800-453-2017, Springleaf Finance, P.O. Box 3662, Evansville, IN 47735-3662. We will promptly investigate your concerns and update our records as needed.
  * We request that you keep your information as up to date as possible so that you may get the maximum benefit from Springleaf Finance. In particular, please make sure that you inform us of e-mail address changes since this is the most rapid way to communicate.



**_How is information collected on this Site protected?_**

  * Springleaf Finance uses multiple levels of security regardless of the delivery channel you choose. We maintain personally identifying information in secure computer systems and we limit employee access to those with a business reason to see it. More specifically, employees may access information about you when needed to maintain your accounts or otherwise meet your needs. We safeguard information according to established security standards and procedures. Our employees are trained to understand and comply with these information principles.
  * Springleaf Finance is protected by a system of filtering routers and firewalls, which form a barrier between the outside Internet and the internal network. The filtering router verifies the source and destination of each network packet, and determines whether or not to let the packet through. Access is denied if the packet is not directed at a specific, available service.



The firewall is used to shield Springleaf Finance's client service network from the Internet. All incoming IP traffic is actually addressed to the firewall, which is designed to allow only e-mail into the client service environment. Traffic through the firewall is subjected to a special proxy process which operates in much the same way as a filtering router, verifying the source and destination of each information packet.

The proxy then changes the IP address of the packet to deliver it to the appropriate site within the client service network. In this way, all inside addresses are protected from outside access, and the structure of Springleaf Finance's internal networks is invisible to outside observers.

  
**_Am I protected when linking to other sites?_**

  * This Site may, from time to time, contain links to other Internet web sites, banner ads or advertisements for the convenience of users in locating information and services that may be of interest. If you use those linked Internet web sites or advertisements, you may leave this site and go to web sites that we do not control. If you decide to visit those Internet sites or advertisers, you do so at your own risk and it is your responsibility to read and comply with the privacy statement on those web sites. Your right to privacy on linked sites is limited to whatever rights are provided to you by the owner of the linked site.
  * This Website Privacy Policy is for customers and visitors, and only applies to this Site. This Site only includes its home page and pages hereunder operated by Springleaf Finance. This Website Privacy Policy does not apply to any linked site, any site provided by a third party or any other site provided by Springleaf Finance. You must consult the privacy policy of each site, particularly at any sites provided by third parties, in order to determine what information about you is collected and how that information is used.



**_Do We Collect Information about Children?_**

  * We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from our Site about children under the age 13. We request that persons under the age of 18 not use our site without supervision from a responsible adult. If a child whom we know to be under the age of 13 sends personal information to us online, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child, notify parents, or seek parental consent.
