# Privacy Policy | Sprout

_Last Updated: 10/10/17_

_Hi there! We made some recent changes to the Sprout Privacy Policy because, as the newest member of the NBCUniversal family, we decided we should look and feel like the rest of the crew. So what’s new, you ask? For starters, you’ll notice the NBCUniversal overall policy contains new children’s sections for Sprout and our new Universal Kids site, including descriptions of when and how we may collect data from kids. We also added updated contact information in case you want to reach out to us. Our goal is to make the sections directed towards kids both easy to read and understand, and we think we’ve done a great job. And we hope you do too!_

This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of NBCUniversal Media LLC including our affiliate companies ("NBCUniversal", "we", "our" or "us"). You can find information about NBCUniversal, including our affiliates, [here.](http://www.nbcuniversal.com/business)

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and transfer information about users who interact with us including (but not limited to) via our websites, downloadable applications, such as games, interactive TV and Mobile Apps (as defined below) that link to this policy ("online services"). This policy only applies to those online services that link to this policy. This policy also tells you how we use tracking technologies, cookies and browsing data we collect from your use of our online services, the measures we take to protect the security of the information you provide to us through our online services, and how you can contact us if you have any questions regarding our online services (including if you want to unsubscribe from our services or update your contact details). Information about how NBCUniversal processes your information outside our online services (e.g. working for NBCUniversal or visiting NBCUniversal premises) is available by contacting [privacy@nbcuni.com.](mailto:privacy@nbcuni.com)

### HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

Information sharing within NBCUniversal and among NBCUniversal affiliates.

  * Your information may be shared with NBCUniversal affiliates, and used to help us better tailor our services, products and advertising to you.   
Information sharing with third parties – e.g. service providers, advertisers, consumer data resellers, social networks:
  * _Service providers that we have retained to perform certain business-related functions on our behalf:  _for example service providers who offer services including research and analytics; hosting websites, fulfilling transactions, maintaining databases, administering contests, providing technology services and platforms, and processing payments. These parties are provided only with the information about you that they need to perform their functions and can only use and disclose that information as is necessary to perform the services on our behalf, or to comply with legal requirements. We take steps to ensure that third party service providers will take appropriate steps to protect your information.
  * _Social Networks:  _You may interact with certain features of our online services that cause information to be published to your social networks. For example, you may click on a Facebook "like" button, which publishes to your Facebook account that you "like" one of our TV shows or movies. On pages of our online services that contain social network functionality, the social network providing the functionality may be able to collect information about you, even if you don’t use that functionality. For example, if a page within our online services contains a Facebook "like" button, Facebook may be able to collect data about your visit to that page, even if you don’t click on the "like" button. To control this sharing of information, please review the privacy policy of the relevant social network and/or log out of it before you use our online services.
  * _For Mobile Apps:  _In [Mobile Apps](https://www.nbcuniversal.com/privacy/mobile-apps/#optouts), information about you and about how you use our mobile apps may be shared with technology providers, carriers, analytics providers, and/or other mobile apps either operated by us or third parties. Please see our Mobile Apps [section](https://www.nbcuniversal.com/privacy/mobile-apps) for additional detail.
  * _Advertisers, Advertising Networks and Consumer Data Resellers:  _Some online services, including Mobile Apps, may be supported with advertising, and collect data to help our online services serve ads. This helps keep the cost of online services low or free. We work with advertisers and third-party advertising networks and consumer data resellers that buy and/or sell information to other companies for multiple purposes including offering products and services that may interest you. These third parties may receive information about how you interact with content and advertising provided in our online services. These third parties may view, edit or set their own tracking technologies/cookies, which will allow them to collect information about you. For information about your choices relating to the transfer of information via such technologies see our [Cookies and Tracking Technologies](https://www.nbcuniversal.com/privacy/cookies/) section.
  * _Sharing of Video Viewing Behavior:  _we may share information (and you agree to this sharing) about the video content you view on our online services with video measurement services such as Nielsen TV Ratings, analytics providers and advertising companies, and third party social media sites. This sharing shall continue for two years or until you withdraw your consent. Information that may be passed to video measurement services such as Nielsen TV Ratings, analytics providers and advertising companies may be via cookies and tracking technologies. For information about your choices relating to transfer of information via such technologies see [Cookies and Tracking Technologies](https://www.nbcuniversal.com/privacy/cookies/) section.  
To opt out of video measurement services by Nielsen TV Ratings specifically please click [here](http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy#choice) 

Information sharing with other parties: 

In addition, we may disclose your information to law enforcement agencies, government/regulatory bodies, and content protection organizations to:

  * Protect our legal rights, privacy or safety, and that of our subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, agents, contractors, or other individuals;
  * Protect the safety and security of visitors to our online services or other properties;
  * Protect against fraud or other illegal activity or for risk management purposes;
  * Respond to inquiries or requests from government, regulatory, law enforcement, or public authorities;
  * Permit us to pursue available remedies, commence, participate in, or defend litigation, or limit the damages that we may sustain;
  * Comply with the law including with subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, and other legal process; or
  * Enforce applicable terms of service.   
 _Sale or transfer of all or part of our business or assets_

We reserve the right to transfer the information described in this Privacy Policy in the event we sell or transfer all or a part of our business or assets so that the buyer can continue to offer you the online services. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with reasonable notice of such transfer, or as otherwise required by law. If you do not want your information to be processed following such a transfer, you should contact the subsequent owner of the business.




### CHILDREN

Most of our online services are intended for users of all ages. This section outlines NBCUniversal's information practices in the United States with respect to personal information (as defined by the Children’s Online Privacy Act ("COPPA")) collected on online services directed to children under the age of 13, such as Sprout and Universal Kids, or from children who we have actual knowledge are under the age of 13 (“child” or "children"). For more information about COPPA see [here](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children%27s-privacy).

Please see the other sections of this Privacy Policy for our information practices regarding online services (or portions of such services) that are directed to parents, users over the age of 13, or general audiences.

If we knowingly collect personal information on a child-directed service or from a user we have actual knowledge is a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to 1) fulfill the request or allow the child to participate in the activity, 2) ensure the security of our users and our online services, and/or 3) as required by law. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA's requirements, we will either delete that personal information or seek parental consent. Collection and Use of Personal Information from Children

_Collection and Use of Personal Information from Children_

If an online service seeks to collect personal information from a child that is not subject to an exception under COPPA, we will first ask for a parent or guardian’s consent to that collection as required by law.

Our online services directed to children may collect the following information from children for the purposes described:

  * _Registration Information:_  Children may be able to register with an online service to view content, participate in contests, play games and more. We may ask the child to provide a screen name (that does not include the child’s name) and password. We may also request information for notification purposes, such as a parent or guardian’s email address, the child’s first name and gender, and birth date.
  * _Email Address for One-Time Response:_  We may ask for a child's email address or other online contact information in order to respond to a question or request from a child. We will delete this information after responding to the question or request. If an online service allows children to create accounts by providing name and email address, we will first seek parental consent as required by COPPA.
  * _Email Address for Newsletters or Other Ongoing Communications:  _Our online services may offer ongoing communications to our users, such as newsletters or show updates. In such circumstances, we may collect a child’s email address or other online contact information, along with a parent’s email address. We will notify the parent via email about the collection and use of the child's information and provide the parent an opportunity to prevent further contact with the child.
  * _Content:_  We may allow children to submit content to us. If a child includes personal information in such content, we will take reasonable measures to delete the personal information or first seek parental consent.
  * _Contests and Sweepstakes Entry Information:  _Our online services may feature contests or sweepstakes and seek information necessary for a child to participate in such contest, including the child’s first name and parent’s email address to notify the parent (as required by law). If the child wins the contest, we may contact the parent via email to request information for prize fulfillment.
  * Information to Obtain Parental Consent: We may ask a child for a parent’s or guardian’s email address or other permissible contact information in order to request consent. If we do not receive parental consent within a reasonable time, we will delete the contact information and any other related information collected from the child. We may conduct other methods of parental consent permitted by COPPA, including obtaining a credit card number and charging a fee (which may be nominal), asking a parent to speak to a customer service representative by phone or video, or requiring submission of a signed consent form.
  * _Persistent Identifiers:_  Our online services may automatically collect persistent identifiers for internal operations, including to provide and improve our online services, conduct analytics, authenticate users, personalize content, maintain the security and integrity of the service, and to ensure legal or regulatory compliance. Specifically, we may collect Internet protocol or IP address, pages and content visited, the type and version of operating system or web browser, device ID. We, or our third party service providers, may collect this information using HTTP cookies, flash cookies, HTML5 and Flash local storage, web beacons/GIFs, embedded scripts, and ETags/cache browsers ("Cookies"). The third-party operators who collect persistent identifiers on our online services directed to children are available here.



_Disclosure of Personal Information from Children_

We may share or disclose personal information collected from children in the following circumstances:

  * With our service providers in order for them to perform service on our behalf;
  * As permitted or required by law, including in response to a court order or a subpoena.
  * To protect the safety of a child, to prevent a crime, or to facilitate a public safety investigation;
  * To take precautions against liability; or
  * To protect the security or integrity of our online services.



In addition, personal information collected from a child may be shared or publicly posted if we first obtain parental consent.

_Parental Controls_    
Parents or guardians may contact [privacy@nbcuni.com](mailto:privacy@nbcuni.com) to review personal information provided by his or her child, have such information deleted, and/or refuse to allow further collection or use of such information. You may send mail inquiries to: Chief Privacy

To protect children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify a parent’s identity before granting access to any personal information.

_Minors Under 18_  
Minors under 18 years old may request the removal of any information that they posted to NBCUniversal sites by contacting [privacy@nbcuni.com](mailto:privacy@nbcuni.com). Upon such request, NBCUniversal will anonymize, or remove from public view, any content posted by a minor to one of its websites, unless required by law to retain such content or information.

For certain websites covered by this Privacy Policy and involved in e-commerce, you may only be able to use that site and any related services if you are 18 years of age or older, or the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence, whichever is older. If you are under the age of 18 or the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence, you may only use that site and any related services with the involvement of a parent or legal guardian.

### HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

We maintain procedural, technical, and physical safeguards for our online services to help protect against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the information you provide via our online services. We also ask the service providers that help us deliver our online services to do the same. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our online services. Unfortunately, no transmission of data is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under our control to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. Therefore, any transmission of information to us is made at your own risk. If you believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please notify us using the contact details below.

_Usernames & Passwords_

### WHERE YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE USED

NBCUniversal is based in the United States and may from time to time transfer your information to other countries and make it accessible to any of our affiliates and third party service providers internationally. Where the transfer of information is to a country that does not provide an adequate level of information protection, NBCUniversal has taken steps to ensure that your information receives an appropriate level of protection.

If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect may be transferred to, and processed, stored and used in the United States. Under United States law, your information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States.

By using our online services and providing your information to us, you understand and agree that your information may be sent to other countries including those which do not provide an equivalent level of information protection as the European Economic Area (EEA).

### COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

For more information about the use of Cookies and Other Technology on our online services (including your opt-out choices) please see the [Cookies and Tracking Technologies](https://www.nbcuniversal.com/privacy/cookies) policy. Through our Cookies and Tracking Technologies policy, we provide opt-out choices. The effect of an opt-out will be to stop targeted advertising, but it will still allow the collection of usage data for certain purposes (e.g., research, analytics, and internal online services operation purposes).

### MOBILE APPS

_Do Not Track_  
California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how NBCUniversal responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. NBCUniversal does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.

We do not endorse or control the policies or practices of third party websites that we do not control or operate.

You should always carefully read the privacy policy of any website you access in order to understand their specific privacy and information usage practices.

### UPDATES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
