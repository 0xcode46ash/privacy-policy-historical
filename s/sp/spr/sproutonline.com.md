PBS KIDS Sprout, an entity of Children’s Network, LLC (“Sprout”), is the first multi-platform service (on-air, on-demand, and online) devoted to preschool children and their parents (references to “parents” also means “legal guardians”), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Sprout is available online at www.SproutOnline.com (“SproutOnline.com” or “Website”), providing parents and their children the opportunity to engage in shared moments of learning and laughing together. Our fun, educational, and interactive Website offers programming schedules, original preschooler age-appropriate games, and user-friendly tools that let children and their parents interact with their favorite Sprout characters. The Website also offers content and activities designed for parents to help them learn and be inspired. This Privacy Policy applies to this Website and does not apply to other Sprout products or services. SproutOnline.com is directed to, and intended for, residents of the United States. We are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of users of this Website, including complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”) when applicable, as discussed in more detail below. 

## Children’s Privacy

SproutOnline.com does not condition a child’s participation in any activity on this Website on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. 

Sprout and its service providers who provide support for the operations of our Website generally do not collect personal information from children under the age of 13. In the event that we have knowledge that a child under the age of 13 has submitted any personal information to us via this Website, we may use the email address provided by the child for the sole purpose of responding to the child’s question or carrying out his or her request on a one-time-only basis. We will not use the email address provided by the child for any other purpose and we will delete it from our records. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personal information other than an email address from a child under the age of 13, we will delete the information immediately. Features on our Website that are open to non-registered users, such as games, electronic postcards, or certain materials that can be submitted to Sprout, may collect only non-personal information, such as a first name, age, hometown, and home state. Sprout may provide non-registered users and registered users with the opportunity to send a link to material on the Website to friends and family electronically. To do so, Sprout may ask for the sender’s first name, recipient’s first name, and recipient’s email address. Recipient email addresses are used only to send the electronic materials to complete the sender’s request. 

In the event that you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information from your child, you can review such personal information collected from your child on this Website, have such information deleted, and refuse to allow further collection or use of such information. Parents can agree to the collection of personal information from their child and the use of such information without agreeing to the disclosure of such information to third parties. Parents generally have a right to opt out of having personal information collected from their child disclosed to third parties. In the event that you believe we have collected personal information from your child, to carry out such requests, please contact us at the email address provided below and a SproutOnline.com representative will guide you through the necessary procedures. 

## Collection and Use of Information

We or our service providers who provide support for the operations of our Website collect personal information about you, your family, or your friends that you voluntarily provide on this Website. We use this information for various purposes, including to enhance your experience with this Website and provide you with the services or products you requested. Areas of this Website that require a user to complete a registration process before using those areas are solely directed to parents that are at least 18 years of age. Sprout uses “bumper” pages or similar notifications at certain points to let users know when they are entering an area that is limited to registered users. To register, parents must enter their birth date to confirm that they are at least 18 years old. Parents must also create a unique account name and password and provide personal information including the parent’s full name, parent’s email address, and parent’s home address. 

Sprout uses the information collected during the registration process to provide parents access to parent-directed features and activities, which may include customizing a user’s own web page and uploading photographs. We also use this information to communicate with you and carry out your requests, including providing you with promotional emails or postal mail about Sprout and third parties. By changing the settings on the “My Account” page, users may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Sprout. 

If you have submitted your child's first name and birth date as part of your account information, your child’s first name, birth date, age, hometown, and home state may be announced during Sprout television programming or on SproutOnline.com and you may receive a birthday message to share with your child via email, this Website, or postal mail. The child’s first name and birth date information that you provide on the registration page will not be shared with third parties for any other purpose. 

Registered users may be given the opportunity to upload materials for display on parts of this Website accessible to all users. When a registered user uploads such materials, such as a photograph, video, or artwork (“image”), we request that the registered user also post information which may include the corresponding child’s first name, age, hometown, and home state (“image label”) on this Website. We may use images and image labels on SproutOnline.com, any other Sprout website, or in Sprout television programming or Sprout promotional materials. 

Website users, including non-registered users, may also be given the opportunity to send messages to Sprout, such as birthday wishes or messages to Sprout characters, and are also requested to provide image label information in connection with such messages. However, only registered users may upload and submit images in connection with such messages. We may use images and image labels on SproutOnline.com, any other Sprout website, or in Sprout television programming or Sprout promotional materials.

Use and disclosure of such entry information with third-party sponsors is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties, and is not the responsibility of Sprout.
