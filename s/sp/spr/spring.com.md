# Spring Group - Privacy policy

Privacy is important to us all, and Spring Group and its subsidiaries (referred to here as "Spring", "we" or "our") will always protect your personal information in line with the UK Data Protection Acts 1984 and 1998.

Information about your bank and your right to work is only seen by a limited number of Spring employees.

We may record and store any telephone calls you have with us for record keeping and quality control.

## What if I don’t want you to share information about me?
