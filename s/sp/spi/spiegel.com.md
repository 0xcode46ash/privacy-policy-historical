Third party merchants "Presented by Spiegel"

If you make a purchase from a Merchant Site with a link originating from the Spiegel eMarket site or a Merchant catalog or website "presented by" Spiegel, the information you provide to that Merchant, such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to the Merchant and not to Spiegel. Providing this information to the Merchant enables the transaction to take place. However, you should know that the Merchant may, if you do not advise them to the contrary, share your name and postal and email addresses with third parties, including Spiegel. You should also know that these Merchants have their own privacy and data collection practices and are not covered by the Spiegel privacy statement.

Merchants on the Spiegel eMarket site and those Merchants, who send catalogs or host websites "presented by Spiegel, have separate privacy and data collection practices. We have no control over and therefore no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding Spiegel eMarket Merchants or other Merchants who send catalogs or host websites "presented by" Spiegel and their privacy policies, please see the Merchant’s home page and click on their Information link or review the customer service section of any catalog you may receive from the Merchant. For a complete listing of the Spiegel eMarket Merchants, [Click Here](http://www.spiegel.com/emarket/merchant.asp).

Merchants on the Spiegel eMarket site that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of these Merchants are not covered by the Spiegel privacy statement.

When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information, such as financial information, we will redirect you to a secure server and notify you through a pop-up screen on our site.

We have appropriate security measures in place in our facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site so you can feel comfortable and secure.

Children's Privacy

Changes to this privacy statement

From time to time, we may use the information you provide us for new, unanticipated uses not previously addressed in our Privacy Statement.

Conflict in terms

It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. We have created this easy-to-read Privacy Statement with that goal in mind. Some browsers utilize privacy enhancing technology to translate our Privacy Statement into a computer readable format. The technology then requires that the computer format be translated back into human readable format for you to read. This translation back into human readable format is often referred to as a "Policy Summary". It is possible that through these translations, the Policy Summary may unintentionally end up being inconsistent with the Privacy Statement upon which it is based. It might fail to address an issue or it might address an issue not raised in our Privacy Statement. For this reason, you should rely on our Privacy Statement as the most accurate and definitive description of our practices.
