A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on the Site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser.

As an individual, you have the opportunity to limit the personal information you provide.

We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.
