## Information Veritas Health Collects about Our Visitors

Veritas Health and its Web sites may collect information that can be categorized as non-personal information or personally identifiable information.

### Non-Personal Information

Non-personal information is information that cannot be traced back to you or any specific individual (“non-personally identifiable information” or “non-PII”). For example, Veritas Health may know “traffic data” such as how many searches are queried each day on its Web sites and the geographic location, but does not know the names, email addresses, or gender of the people searching.

Each time a visitor comes to a Veritas Health Web site, we may collect some information to improve the overall quality of the online experience, including page monitoring, page improvement, and targeted advertising. On Veritas Health properties, basic anonymous information may be collected by our Web servers, such as the visitor's Internet service provider (ISP) (e.g., whether the user is logged on from AOL or Comcast), referral data (e.g., which search engine a user visited and used prior to clicking through to Veritas Health), and technical data (e.g., browser, platform, connection speed). We may use this information in the administration of our sites, diagnosing problems with our servers, improving site usability, and analyzing trends.

In addition to collecting these types of information, Veritas Health collects aggregate queries for internal reporting and targeted advertising. We also count, track, and aggregate the visitors’ activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within Veritas Health, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but Veritas Health will not disclose your individual identity or personal data without your permission. When Veritas Health does present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify or contact you. In addition, Veritas Health does not provide third-party access to your personal information except in the aggregate and only after the information has been anonymized. The information will be in the form of grouped statistics compiled from our users' answers to survey questions and on-site behavior.

  * **Cookies**

Veritas Health uses cookies (small text files stored by a Web site on your computer to track information and recognize you) to monitor traffic flow, patterns of travel within and through the site, and to target advertising. Cookies are a standard Internet technology that allows us to both store and retrieve login information on a user's system. Our Web server automatically asks a new user whether his or her browser will agree to accept a Veritas Health cookie file. If a visitor accepts, our Web server will identify the user's cookie for Veritas Health's use in internal reporting. If a user accepts a Veritas Health cookie, but would later like to remove it from his or her computer, he or she can just remove it from the browser. The cookie does not track any personal information about you, or extract information for us to contact you.

Some ad servers allow you to opt out of anonymous data collection through the use of cookies. To do so, you must opt out of such data collection with each individual site. You can opt out of cookies for several ad servers by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative gateway opt-out site:

    * <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>

Similarly, Veritas Health Web sites provide links to other Web resources and content partners, and users that click on these links will be taken off our Web sites. These other sites may use their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. You should read the privacy policies of each site you visit to determine what information that site may be collecting about you and if you agree to how it will be used.

  * **Web Beacons**

Some Veritas Health Web pages and/or third parties may use Web beacons in conjunction with cookies to compile aggregate statistics about Web site usage. A Web beacon is an electronic image, also called an action tag, single pixel (1x1), clear GIF, or Web bug. Web beacons can recognize certain types of anonymous information on a visitor's computer, such as a visitor's IP address, time and date of a page view, type of browser, and the existence of cookies previously set by that server. This is information that is available to any Web server you visit. Web beacons do not give any "extra" information away; they are simply a convenient way to gather the simplest of statistics and manage cookies.

Web beacons are typically used by a third-party to monitor the activity of a site. You have the option to render some Web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies. The Web beacon may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address, but unique information will not be recorded and we do not tie the information gathered in a Web beacon to personally identifiable information.

  * **Web Analytics**

Veritas Health uses Google Analytics to analyze the audience of the website and improve our content. No personal information is collected from Google Analytics. Veritas Health, LLC follows all guidelines required by Google when pulling Web site data. For further information on the privacy policy concerning Google Analytics, [please go here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en).

## How Veritas Health Protects Your Information

We only collect personally identifiable information about you if you voluntarily provide it to us, for example, when you register on the site and provide your name and e-mail for us to send an e-newsletter to you. We use the personally identifiable information that you supply to provide you with the specific services you select and may occasionally send you emails about Web site maintenance and updates, which may include new features and enhanced functionality.

Veritas Health uses reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information under our control and appropriately limit access to it. We use a variety of information security measures to protect your online transactions with us. Veritas Health Web sites use encryption technology to protect your personal information you submit via our Website and during data transport. That being said, Veritas Health, LLC cannot guarantee or warrant the security of information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personally identifiable information that you may provide. However, electronic transmissions via the Internet are not necessarily secure from interception, and so we cannot absolutely guarantee the security or confidentiality of such transmissions.

To further protect your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving marketing or promotional marketing communications from Veritas Health, LLC or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services.

We will retain your personal information as long as your account is active and/or it is needed to provide you services. At any time you can remove your personal information or instruct us to remove it, but you should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided. We will retain your personal information as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
