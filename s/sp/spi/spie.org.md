# Privacy Policy - SPIE - The international society for optics and photonics

When you browse the SPIE website, you do so anonymously. We do not collect personal information, except as you provide it to work with the Society. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) and use cookies to tell us which parts of our website you visit and how long you spend there. We track what country you are accessing the Internet from, and what time and date you visited. Other information automatically provided to us is the type of computer and operating system you are using. Your browser supplies us with this information. We use this information from our server logs to learn more about how we can provide the best experience on our website and provide the most relevant content possible. 

**Credit Card Information**  
We collect your credit card information, such as card number and card expiration date, when you purchase products on our site. Encrypted transaction capabilities are available, if you choose to use them. We do not store your credit card information.

 **Profiles**  
[SPIE.org Profiles](http://www.spie.org/about-spieorg-profiles) is a feature that allows you to publicly display relevant professional information about yourself on the SPIE.org website. You have the ability to manage what information is displayed in your profile via the SPIE.org Profile tab in My Account (sign in required). You may view, update, add or remove any information forming a part of your SPIE.org Profile at any time. Your public profile contains the following: your name, photo, affiliation/organization, job title, company website, SPIE Member type, SPIE involvement (committees currently serving on, conference chair, etc.), areas of expertise, profile summary, SPIE publications, SPIE conference involvement, and SPIE courses taught. If provided by you, others may also view other relevant publications, conferences, and courses taught, and external websites such as LinkedIn. In addition you may choose to allow others who are logged in to their SPIE accounts view your contact information (mailing addresses, phone, fax) and to send you email by opting into SPIE's private messaging. By adding or modifying information in your SPIE.org Profile you agree to allow SPIE to populate or update other databases maintained by us with this information, as applicable. SPIE reserves the right to remove information from a profile that is deemed inappropriate. 

**Website Forms**  
We obtain information you provide in online forms such as your name, address, and e-mail address. We may use this information to provide you with information about the products and services offered by SPIE. Online forms are available for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect information about you only if you voluntarily provide contact information within these forms.

If you do not wish to receive relevant information through the mail from organizations other than SPIE, you may email SPIE, telephone SPIE Customer Service, or indicate so on forms where the option is available.

E-mail addresses are never released to third parties as a matter of SPIE policy.

 **Discussion Boards**  
SPIE will not sell or share the material on its discussion boards with any organization. Posted material is archived in the SPIE database.

 **Disclosure**  
We retain the right to release your personal information to proper authorities when required by law or when, in good faith, we believe that we must release the information to:

(a) defend the rights of SPIE or its affiliates or business partners  
(b) protect the personal safety of SPIE employees, agents, affiliates, business partners, customers, or site users.

 **Security**  
This site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We have taken the necessary steps to provide a secure server for transmission of sensitive data to and from our site. We encrypt all data (including your credit card number) transmitted through our secure Web server so no one else can read it.

 **Privacy Policy Changes**  
If we decide to change the Privacy Policy, we will post the revisions so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
