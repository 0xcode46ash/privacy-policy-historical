# Privacy Policy - SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering. The Optics, Photonics, Fibers, and Lasers Resource.

### SPIE Privacy Policy 

Thank you for visiting SPIE—The International Society for Optical Engineering. 

Your privacy is important to us. We provide this policy explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the information you share with us. The policy also expresses the care with which we treat your personal information.

_SPIE is committed to respecting your privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information you share with us._

_Collection of Non-Personal Information_

When you browse the SPIE Web site, you do so anonymously. We do not collect personal information—including your e-mail address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to tell us which parts of our Web site you visit and how long you spend there. We do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. We track what country you are accessing the Internet from, and what time and date you visited. Other information automatically provided to us is the type of computer and operating system you are using. Your browser supplies us with this information. We use this information from our server logs to learn more about our visitors as a group, not about you as an individual. The information helps us identify overall usage patterns and trends on the site.

_Credit Card Information_

We collect your credit card information, such as card number and card expiration date, when you purchase products on our site. Encrypted transaction capabilities are available, if you choose to use them. We do not store your credit card information.

_Cookies_

What is a Cookie? A cookie is a small file that a web site stores on your computer, which does not collect personal information about you. When you revisit the Web site, your browser sends information back to the site. Cookies allow Web sites to maintain certain information such as reference codes that indicate your eligibility for member privileges. Cookies can only store data provided by the server or generated by an explicit user action. Only the site that provides them can read them. You can configure most Web browsers to notify you when cookies arrive and ask your approval to accept them, or to refuse cookies outright. Most browsers can also delete cookies you may have accepted in the past.

_Web Site Forms_

We obtain information you provide to us in online forms such as your name, address, and e-mail address. We may use this information to provide you with information about the products and services offered by SPIE. Online forms are available for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect information about you only if you voluntarily provide contact information within these forms.

If you do not wish to receive relevant information through the mail from organizations other than SPIE, you may email [SPIE](https://web.archive.org/web/20050307234948id_/http%3A//spie.org/address-change@spie.org), telephone SPIE Customer Service, or indicate so on forms where the option is available.

E-mail addresses are never released to third parties as a matter of SPIE policy. 

_Discussion Boards_

SPIE will not sell or share the material on its discussion boards with any organization. Posted material is archived in the SPIE database.

_Disclosure_

We retain the right to release your personal information to proper authorities when required by law or when, in good faith, we believe that we must release the information to:

(a) satisfy a legal order or comply with legal process   
(b) defend the rights of SPIE or its affiliates or business partners   
(c) protect the personal safety of SPIE employees, agents, affiliates, business partners, customers, or site users. 

_Security_

This site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We have taken the necessary steps to provide a secure server for transmission of sensitive data to and from our site. We encrypt all data (including your credit card number) transmitted through our secure Web server so no one else can read it.

_Privacy Policy Changes_

If we decide to change the Privacy Policy, we will post the revisions so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
