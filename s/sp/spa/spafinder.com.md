**What information do we collect?**   
Spa Finder collects information in several ways from different parts of our website. Some personal information is gathered when you register to open an account. During registration, Spa Finder asks for your user name, password, e-mail address, zip code, and name. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by Spa Finder and/or our many partners; and when you report a problem with our site or services. If you contact Spa Finder we may keep a record of that correspondence. Spa Finder also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever Spa Finder collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. 

**What are cookies and how does Spa Finder use them?**   
"Cookies" are small text files that are used to store and sometimes track information about you. Cookies are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to prevent that. 

Generally, we use cookies to: 

  * Remind us of who you are and to access your account information in order to provide you with a more personalized service. 
  * Estimate our audience size. 
  * Assist departments in Spa Finder to track visits to and business at their departments, and to process the items in your shopping bag. 
  * Track your entries, submissions, and status in some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. Spa Finder also collects IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. 



**How does Spa Finder use my information?**   
Spa Finder's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with personalized services, interactive communications and online shopping ease. 

**Who is collecting information?**   
When you are on the Spa Finder web site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Spa Finder alone. Some data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared. 

**With whom does Spa Finder share my information?**   
Spa Finder does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. Except, Spa Finder may share your personal identification information with our contractors to improve services to you, but only if the contractor agrees to keep such information confidential. 

**What choices do I have on the collection, use, and distribution of my personal information?**   
You have choices about how the information you have provided us may be used by us to make special offers to you. You can direct us to have your name and address removed from our mailing list. 

**What is Spa Finder's policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete my personally identifiable information?**   
You may edit your Spa Finder Account Information at any time by using your Spa Finder ID and password. Your Spa Finder account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will result in not being able to access any members-only area of the website.
