For example, only registered members are able to view their purchase history, track packages, and earn loyalty points and badges. The more information you provide us (and the more accurate it is) the better we are able to customize your experience on our website.

In addition, we may ask you for information at other times, for example, in connection with a sweepstakes, or a survey. Your choose whether to participate in such events. If you do participate, we may share your information with sponsoring business partners.

We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you. For example, if you visit Spafinder.com from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us.

We also automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit Spafinder.com. For example, we will collect session data, including your IP address, Web browser software, and referring website.
