SparkTrust Systems Inc. (“SparkTrust Systems”), makers of eTrue, is committed to protecting the privacy of any personal information you may submit and provide to us when visiting this website and/or using any of our services. This Privacy Policy describes SparkTrust Systems’ policy with respect to its collection, use, and disclosure of any personal information.

##### Information Collection

When you purchase, register, subscribe or use any of the SparkTrust Systems services (“Services”), toolbars or software, we may collect personal information which may include, without limitation, your name, address, email address, and phone number for the purpose of recording the transaction, your registration, your subscription, or tracking your usage when you engage in activities on our web site or within the Services. After you use our toolbars or software, SparkTrust may maintain a partial or full record of the names of the file or the words you searched, the browser you used, and information about malicious applications, files and other potential threats on your computer. When we use a payment processing merchant we ensure that the same strict privacy criteria are in place. We do not (knowingly) collect personal information from persons under the age of eighteen. By registering for SparkTrust software, you agree to receive information related to the price of this product via electronic communication. We also give our users the option of receiving useful product and Service information (such as Service updates, Service alerts, Service outages and/or any associated product offerings), via opt-in permission based email. We fully ensure your privacy and value your trust. We will never sell, rent, lease or trade your personal information to any third party. Likewise, your personal information will not be shared with a third party in any other way unless SparkTrust Systems is required to do so by law. SparkTrust Systems may engage the services of a third party from time to time and may provide certain information that includes personal information in order for the third party to perform such services. Any third parties who provide services to SparkTrust Systems have agreed not to disclose your information or use it for any other purpose, and are required to implement or adopt a Privacy Policy that is no less stringent than SparkTrust Systems’ Privacy Policy. However, if you are using a SparkTrust toolbar or product with search functionality, we may share your IP address with search providers. They may have their own privacy policies that you should familiarize yourself with. You may opt out of receiving emails from us at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email. By choosing to enter and submit the requested information when prompted in order to purchase, register, subscribe, or access any of the Services, you are consenting to SparkTrust Systems’ collection, use, and disclosure of such information for the purposes as outlined herein.

Any information that you post to a chat room, public bulletin or forum is available to all users of that site. SparkTrust Systems cannot control, nor is it responsible for the use, disclosure, or dissemination of such information by any third parties.
