# Sparx Systems - Privacy Statement

Your privacy is important to Sparx Systems (“Sparx”). This statement discloses the information practices for Sparx’s Web Sites (“Sites”), including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. 

  
Personal Information 

In general, you can visit Sparx on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when we or our partners may need information from you. You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and e-mail ID, to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you with a subscription. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so. 

We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with Sparx’s sites and services. We also collect certain standard information your browser sends to every site you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring web site addresses. 

  
Use of Your Personal Information 

Sparx collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve its Site and deliver the services or carry out the transactions you have requested. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service, making the Site or services easier to use, performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services, and technologies. 

  
Sharing of Your Personal Information 

Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information outside of Sparx without your consent. 

  
Disclosure Required by Law 

Please be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. 

  
Sparx Systems Forums

If you participate in Sparx Systems' Discussion Forum or the Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect Community Site ("community site"), you should be aware the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside Sparx, who have access to that discussion forum, chat room or community site pages. Also, please recognize that individual forums and community site pages may have additional rules and conditions. Each participant's opinion on the forum or community site is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of Sparx. 

  
Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Technologies 

We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on Sparx’s Site, but we do so in ways that keeps the information non-identifiable. When we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies. 

We collect the information we mentioned through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer, but not you. Some Sparx pages use cookies, sent by Sparx or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Site. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Sites may not work properly.
