Spare5 also collects other information that you choose to provide. This includes, without limitation, your zip code (on its own), individual preferences related to your Account and demographic information (all such information, “Non-Identifying Information”).

### 3\.     Other Automatically Collected Information

3.1    Site and App Log Data. The Site and App automatically collect certain non-personal information such as the date and time you access the Site or App, your IP address, the URL you accessed and the referring URL, the operating system you are using and any content you post to the Site. This information is stored and may be disclosed to others and permanently archived for future use.

3.2    Cookies; Web Beacons. As is commonplace on the internet, we use cookies (alphanumeric identifiers) to associate your browser and computer with your use of the Site. The information you provide while using the Spare5 Services may be stored in these cookies or may be stored on our servers, depending on the information. You may take steps to block or remove cookies at anytime but the site may not function properly if you do.

3.4    3rd Party Web Components. From time to time, we may use 3rd party web components such as display advertising, maps or rich text editors. In such cases, these 3rd parties may collect information subject to the privacy policy of that 3rd party, not Spare5’s Privacy Policy.

### 4\.     How Spare5 Uses and Retains Your Information

We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Spare5 Services, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries. We may use your Personal Information (and disclose it to third parties) to verify your identity, derive other information about you, for fraud prevention, to enforce the terms of the [Terms of Service and Use Agreement](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-service) and otherwise protect the integrity of the Spare5 Services, or to verify other information you provided to us.

If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. Please note that we may also use your Personal Information to contact you with information related to your use of the Spare5 Services; you may not opt out of these notifications unless otherwise required by law.  If you no longer desire to be contacted by Spare5, you must terminate your account and no longer use the Site and Spare5 Services.

We may use and disclose your Identity Information to third parties to promote and market your contributions to Clients or to market or promote the Spare5 Services in general.

### 5\.     Sharing of Information

5.1    Other Users. We may share your Personal Identity with a Client (if you are a Service Provider) or Service Provider (if you are a Client) if the sharing of such information is necessary in order to facilitate the completion of a Task or transaction involving you and the Client or Service Provider, as applicable. To the extent a Recording of a Service Provider’s communication is provided to a Client for verification or quality control purposes, it may also include Identity Information as it exists within the Recording.

5.2    Third Party Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate, advertise and promote the Spare5 Services, to provide part of the Spare5 Services on our behalf, to perform Site-related or App-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site’s or App’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how the Site, App and Spare5 Services are used. These third parties may have access to your Personal Information; if they do, this access is only so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf and they are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

5.3    Change in Control. In the event that we sell our business or engage in mergers, restructurings, changes of control or other such transactions, any information we collect, including your Personal Information, will be subject to a transfer. In the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, customer and user information may be transferred to a bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession and then to a subsequent purchaser. You acknowledge that we are not required to provide you with notice or seek consent in such event.

5.4    Corporate Affiliates.  We may sell, transfer or share your Personal Information with business entities that we control or that are under common control, such as in joint ventures. Any use of your information is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We may also share the information to protect Spare5 interests including sharing select information with credit risk or fraud protection companies.

5.6    Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and any other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information, unless such Personal Information is Non-Identifying Information.

### 6.    Security

We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

We will attempt to make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on our Site or App, insofar as consistent with (a) the legitimate needs of law enforcement, or (b) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

### 7.    Links to Other Sites

The Site or App may contain links to websites owned and controlled by third parties. If you click on any such link you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

### 8\.     Our Policy Toward Children

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 18 years old; nor do we knowingly allow such persons to use the Spare5 Services. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact). If we become aware that a child under 18 years old has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.

### 9\.     Policy Changes

To accommodate changes in our business, we may change or amend this Privacy Policy at any time at Spare5’s sole discretion, on a prospective basis.  We will notify you of such changes by e-mail or by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site, App or via the Spare5 Services. Your continued use of the Site, App or Spare5 Services after any changes to this Privacy Policy shall signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.
