You may take steps to block or remove cookies at anytime but the site may not function properly if you do.

3rd Party Web Component - from time to time, we may use 3rd party web components such as display advertising, maps or rich text editors. In such cases, these 3rd parties may collect information subject to the privacy policy of that 3rd party, not Spare5's Privacy Policy.
