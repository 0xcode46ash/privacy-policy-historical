### Privacy Policy

#### A guide to the use of your personal data

This policy describes and governs the collection, storage and use of personal information collected by us - in particular about our customers and potential customers. It provides you with details about the personal information that we may collect from you, as well as how we use that information.

**1.       Who we are**  
Spark Energy Supply Ltd is a company registered in England (registration number 05857467), whose registered office is at Regent House, 316 Beulah Hill, Upper Norwood, London SE19 3HF. Our trading address is Ettrick Riverside, Dunsdale Road, Selkirk, Scotland TD7 5EB. For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, we are the Data Controller.

**2.       The information we collect about you**  
We may receive information about you if you use any of the other websites we operate or other services we provide. We may also work with third parties and may receive information about you from them.

We may collect the following information about you:

  * your name;
  * your age and sex;
  * your postal address;
  * your phone number (fixed line and/or mobile);
  * fax and e-mail details;
  * energy usage and other service related information (including data gathered and stored on a smart meter);
  * credit history information;
  * details of any criminal offences (where we suspect and/or you have been accused of committing fraud or stealing energy);
  * bank account details;
  * Financial and credit card (or other billing information); and
  * any additional needs you may have.



When you enter into a Contract for the supply of Energy to your Property, we may check our own records and others, such as those of credit reference agencies (CRAs) and fraud prevention agencies (FPAs). When CRAs receive a search request from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders. They supply to us both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit and fraud prevention information.                

We may also make checks such as assessing your application for credit and verifying identities to prevent and detect crime. We may also make periodic searches at CRAs and FPAs to manage your account with us. If you are making a joint application or tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we will link your records together so you must be sure that you have their agreement to disclose information about them. CRAs also link your records together and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.

Information on your Contract may be sent to CRAs and will be recorded by them (including details of your account and how this is managed). If you do not pay our charges in full and on time, CRAs may record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs and FPAs to perform similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe. Records remain on file for 6 years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted.

**3.       Information you give us**
