# SparkNotes.com Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy

This privacy policy covers what information we collect from you when you visit or register for the SparkNotes.com site, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. By using the SparkNotes.com site, you agree with the terms and conditions of this privacy policy and Terms of Use. 

1\. The Information We Collect

When you use our site, we receive and collect certain information. The information that we receive and collect depends on what you do when you visit SparkNotes.com. 

a. _Automatically Collected Information._ Some information is automatically received and sometimes collected from you when you visit the SparkNotes.com site. We receive and collect the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our site. We use this information to monitor the usage of our site. Also, when we send emails to you, we may be able to identify information about your email address, such as whether you can read graphic-rich HTML emails. All of the information we automatically capture provides us with the ability to enhance our users' experience at SparkNotes.com and to determine aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns. 

b. _Information Collected via Cookies._ Both SparkNotes.com and its third party advertisers use cookies to enhance your experience on the SparkNotes.com site. "Cookies" are small files or records that we place on your computer's hard drive to collect information about your activities on the SparkNotes.com site. The cookies transmit this information back to the computers at SparkNotes.com or our third-party distributors of banners and newsletters; these computers are, generally speaking, the only computers which are authorized to read such information. SparkNotes.com does not share the cookies it sets with its third-party distributors. The information captured makes it possible for us (i) to speed navigation, keep track of your purchases, and provide you with custom tailored content; (ii) to remember information you gave to us so you don't have to reenter it each time you visit the SparkNotes.com site; (iii) to monitor the effectiveness of certain of our marketing email campaigns; (iv) to monitor total number of registered users and their associated demographic information, pages viewed, and the total number of banners served; and (v) to target advertising according to demographic information.

Most people do not know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit the SparkNotes.com site or most web sites because browsers are typically set to accept cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie placement. If you refuse cookies, you will not be able to complete an order with us online. Also, if you do not accept cookies, your overall Internet browsing experience will be affected.

If you would like to obtain more information about the third-party distributor of banners on the SparkNotes.com site and to know your choices about having such distributor's cookies turned off, please visit [www.privacychoices.org](http://www.privacychoices.org/). If you turn off the third-party distributor's cookies, you will still see banners on our site; however, the banners will not be tailored to you.

c. _Information Collected Using Pixel Tags or Clear GIFs._ To help us understand the effectiveness of certain of our email marketing efforts, SparkNotes.com may use "message format" and "message open" sensing technologies. Both technologies require the use of pixel tags or clear GIFs (also called web beacons). The "message format" sensing technology allows us to recognize whether you have enabled your email program to receive HTML emails; if so, this information is then associated with your email address so that subsequent messages can be sent to you in HTML format. The "message open" sensing technology allows us to recognize whether you have opened our email message. We can only detect this if your have enabled your email program to receive HTML emails. 

d. _Information You Actively Submit to SparkNotes.com._ For some of the services we provide, we neither require nor collect a "User Profile" -- your name, email address, billing address, shipping address(es), phone number and credit card information. You can use some of the SparkNotes.com site without having to submit a User Profile.

In the following instances, however, we do need you to actively submit your User Profile: when you want to (i) register for the website or complete an order, (ii) subscribe to our newsletters, or (iii) post to message boards. 

e. _Creating a SparkNotes.com Account or Completing an Order._ You can register with SparkNotes.com to view the literature we have made available online, to post to or read message boards, or to order SparkNotes products or services. To use all features of the SparkNotes.com website, you will need to create a password-protected account with us. In doing so, we require that you provide us with all of the following information for your User Profile: your name, email address, billing address, and credit card information. When setting up the account, we ask you to create a password. When you want to make a purchase or change your stored User Profile, we approve your access by verifying your email address with your password.

Security Policy

1\. Protecting your information  


The User Profile you provide -- including your credit card information -- to establish an account with us and to make purchases from us is secured using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. We use this SSL technology to prevent such information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted over the Internet. The encrypted data goes to a secure site where your information is stored on restricted-access computers located at restricted-access sites. 

2\. Password security  


To further secure your User Profile, we require you to create a customer password when you establish an account with us. We encourage you to use a password that is not easily guessed (i.e., don't use your name or street name). Keep your password secret; do not share it with anyone. The only way you can place an order with us online is by entering both your registered email address and password. 

If you forget your password, you can go to [ www.sparknotes.com/membership/contact.html](http://www.sparknotes.com/membership/contact.html) and request a new password. If you want to change your password or other account information, you can also do so at [ www.sparknotes.com/membership/contact.html](http://www.sparknotes.com/membership/contact.html). 

3\. Remember to sign out   


To further prevent unauthorized access to your account, remember that, after you sign in, you should sign out once you have (i) completed your transaction, (i) completed managing your account, or (iii) decided to step away from your computer. Anyone who accesses your computer after you have signed in but before you have signed out can access your account. This is especially true if you have Express Checkout enabled on your account. 

4\. Safe Shopping Guarantee   


Under federal law, a credit card issuer cannot make you liable for charges in excess of $50.00 that result from the unauthorized use of your credit card. There are similar federal laws that relate to debit cards. Exceptions do apply, and you will have to comply with the rules of your credit card or debit card issuer, so please contact your card issuer for further details. 

If a credit card or debit card issuer assesses you a fee because of the unauthorized use of your credit card or debit card on our site, SparkNotes.com will reimburse you for such amount up to $50.00. Please contact our Customer Service for details. 

5\. Changes to security  


This security policy was last changed on July 24, 2003. SparkNotes.com reserves the right to modify or amend this policy at any time by posting the revised security policy on our site. The changes will only affect the information we collect after the effective date of the change to our security policy unless we clearly express otherwise.
