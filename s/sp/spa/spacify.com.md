We do not require any form of registration to access our web site. Our ecommerce partner Yahoo! provides this feature as an option to you so that you may shop more effectively and quickly. 

When purchasing an item we do require that you fill out the necessary information relating to billing and shipping, as well as payment and credit card information. This information is submitted to us using a SSL Secure Server with the highest encryption standards. The information you gives us is stored on the Yahoo servers temporarily and it is kept on file in our offices for our accounting needs. We require your email address in order to reach you by email, as well as to email you a confirmation invoice of your purchase. We will also send you updates regarding the status of your delivery via email. 

When subscribing to our newsletter, we ask that you provide your email address so that we may send you periodical newsletters via email. This list is kept private and secure. In conjunction with the Yahoo Shopping program, we use cookies to provide many of the shopping services that you can access on our site. Cookies are a way of identifying your computer independent from others accessing our web site so that we may continuously display the appropriate information to you. A cookie is a common name for a process of storing a small text file in the files of your browser, storing small bits of information such as which items you have added to your shopping cart, where you are in the shopping prices and what options you have selected. 

Cookies are also used to inform us about what our customers are looking at or not looking at on our site. We may use this information to better personalize the content, products, design and information on our site. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Yahoo! cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
