# Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting this Spa Week Media Group, Ltd. ("SWMG") Internet web site ("Site") located at the URL www.spaweek.com. This Privacy Policy details certain policies implemented throughout SWMG governing SWMG's use of personally identifiable information about users of our Site.

**Privacy Policy Updates**  
Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, SWMG may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, SWMG will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site and we may send registered users an email of the change. SWMG encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes so that you are aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use this information. If any modification is unacceptable to you, you shall cease using this Site. If you do not cease using this Site, you will be deemed to have accepted the change.

**Information Collection and Use**  
You can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, in certain sections of this Site, we may invite you to contact us with questions or comments or request information, subscribe to a newsletter or mailing list, participate in giveaway programs or chat boards, purchase products and services, or complete a registration form. Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, contact data such as your address, phone number, email address, gender, age, income level, job, username, password and credit card information and any other personally identifiable information you elect to include in your communications sent to us or in your postings to the Site. If you purchase a gift certificate or card, you will be asked to provide the name of the recipient of the gift certificate or card.

We may use your personally identifiable information to register you to use our Site, deliver certain goods, services or information you have requested, process your payment, administer our giveaways programs, provide you with notices regarding goods or services you have purchased, send you newsletters and information you have requested and improve the content and general administration of the Site. Other users will be able to view the username of users that have posted information, content and ratings to the Site.

As you browse www.spaweek.com, advertising cookies will be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in. Our display advertising partner, AdRoll, then enables us to present you with retargeting advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with [company website]. The techniques our partners employ do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number. You can visit this page (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) to opt out of AdRoll and their partnersâ€™ targeted advertising.

**Children's Privacy**  
SWMG recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13 and we endeavor not to collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. SWMG targets its services and this Site to adults and not to children under 13.

**Aggregate Information**  
The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site and your movement on this Site and we may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed to third parties in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer and improve the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

**Disclosure**  
We may provide your personally identifiable information and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in providing our services to you. For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information to a credit card processing company to process your payments. We may provide your personally identifiable information to third party entities with which we have a business relationship when you have provided your consent to such transfer of your personally identifiable information to such third parties by opting-in at the point where we collect your personally identifiable information and without your prior consent as we determine for the third parties' own marketing purposes as described in Your California Privacy Rights.

We also will disclose your personally identifiable information when we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, or when we deem it appropriate or necessary to provide such information to law enforcement authorities. We may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which SWMG participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of SWMG's assets to which this Site relates.

**Links to Third Party Sites**  
The Site may provide links to other Web sites or resources over which SWMG does not have control ("External Web Sites"). Such links do not constitute an endorsement by SWMG of those External Web Sites. You acknowledge that SWMG is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that SWMG is not responsible for the content of such External Web Sites. Your use of External Web Sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the linked to External Web Sites.

**Security**  
We may employ procedural and technological security measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. SWMG may use other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information.

**Users Outside of the United States**  
Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal data will be processed by us in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you use this Site from outside the United States, you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
