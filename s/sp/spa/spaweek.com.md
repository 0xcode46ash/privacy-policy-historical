**Privacy Policy Updates**  
Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, Spa Week may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Spa Week will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site and we may send registered users an email of the change. Spa Week encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes so that you are aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use this information. If any modification is unacceptable to you, you shall cease using this Site. If you do not cease using this Site, you will be deemed to have accepted the change.

However, in certain sections of this Site, we may invite you to contact us with questions or comments or request information, subscribe to a newsletter or mailing list, participate in giveaway programs or chat boards, purchase products and services, or complete a registration form. Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, contact data such as your address, phone number, email address, gender, age, income level, job, username, password and credit card information and any other personally identifiable information you elect to include in your communications sent to us or in your postings to the Site.

Other users will be able to view the username of users that have posted information, content and ratings to the Site.

**Children's Privacy**  
Spa Week recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13 and we endeavor not to collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Spa Week targets its services and this Site to adults and not to children under 13.

**Aggregate Information**  
The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site and your movement on this Site and we may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed to third parties in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer and improve the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

**Disclosure**  
We may provide your personally identifiable information and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in providing our services to you. For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information to a credit card processing company to process your payments. We may provide your personally identifiable information to third party entities with which we have a business relationship when you have provided your consent to such transfer of your personally identifiable information to such third parties by opting-in at the point where we collect your personally identifiable information and without your prior consent as we determine for the third parties' own marketing purposes as described in Your [California Privacy Rights](https://web.archive.org/content/california-privacy).

We also will disclose your personally identifiable information when we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, or when we deem it appropriate or necessary to provide such information to law enforcement authorities. We may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Spa Week participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Spa Week's assets to which this Site relates.

**Links to Third Party Sites**  
The Site may provide links to other Web sites or resources over which Spa Week does not have control ("External Web Sites"). Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Spa Week of those External Web Sites. You acknowledge that Spa Week is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Spa Week is not responsible for the content of such External Web Sites.

**Security**  
We may employ procedural and technological security measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Spa Week may use other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information. 

**Users Outside of US**  
Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you use this Site from outside the United States, by using either Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
