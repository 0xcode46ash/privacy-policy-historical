##  Email Forgeries

The Sportsman's Guide is doing its best to protect you from a form of identity theft where emails of well-known companies or Web sites are faked or "spoofed." Email forgers may use email communications that look like Sportsman's Guide emails to collect personal information from you.

To help you detect if an email has been forged, look for the following warning signs:

  * We will never ask you to email us personal information, such as your bank account or credit card information. 
  * We will never send you an email that claims we have lost or are updating your records. 
  * We will never threaten to close your account or cancel an order if you do not provide us with personal information. 



If you suspect you have been sent an email that is from a forged email address, please forward the email to us at [custserv@sportsmansguide.com](mailto:custserv@sportsmansguide.com). Please don't cut and paste the email, and don't change the subject line or forward it as an attachment because that makes it harder for us to investigate. If you are ever in doubt about the authenticity of an email, don't provide personal or sensitive information in an email.
