Privacy law requires Sportsgirl to collect personal information about you directly from you if it is reasonable and practical to do so.  


Generally, you have no obligation to provide any information requested by Sportsgirl.

We do not use or share personal information for any purpose other than for the purpose for which it was disclosed. We do not provide or sell personal information to other organisations. However we may disclose personal information to our service providers who provide services in connection with our products and services.
