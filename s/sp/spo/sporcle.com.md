# Privacy Policy - sporcle

Privacy Policy 

Our goal here at Sporcle is to help you manage your predictions for sports and sporting seasons. You privacy is very important to us. We will do everything we can to meet or exceed your expectations. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/feedback.php). 

Your info

To use the services here at Sporcle, we only require an email and name. We ask for this so you can log back in to your account to make changes. We ask for a name so your friends can know who you are without you having to show your email address. You and only you are able to see and edit this personal information. Please don't share your account information with others, as this would allow them access to your account. 

Messages, etc

Groups are a great way to track your projections with your friends and coworkers. Groups can be set to be private or public. If they are public, then anyone may look at the picks and messages of this group. If you would prefer to keep this information private, it's very easy to make any group private. On the upper left area of the group heading, there is a link to switch a group from public to private (and vice versa). 

Cookies (yum!)

Sporcle uses cookies to make your experience easier. If you ask us, we keep track of your login information so you don't have to reenter your login information every time you come to the site. 

Advertising

We use Google Adsense to show relevant advertising to the kinds of information we provide on this site. Any information collected for this purpose will be completely anonymous. 

Changes

Sporcle's Privacy Policy is subject to change from time to time. The most up to date version will always be available at <http://www.sporcle.com/privacy.php>. Your use of this website after any changes constitutes your agreement with this policy.
