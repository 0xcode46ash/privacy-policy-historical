By using this Website, you signify your consent to the collection, use and sharing practices described in this Privacy Policy. By providing your information to Us through this Website or through Our Customer Service Department in connection with this Website, you signify your consent to the information collection, use and sharing practices described in this Privacy Policy.

Types of Information Collected

We collect personal and non-personal information that you provide to Us when using this Website or that you provide to Our Customer Service Department when communicating with Us offline or via e-mail. 

Personal information that you provide to Us, such as your full name, street address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number and credit card expiration date, is collected, stored and used only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise disclosed at the time We request such information from you. For example, when you open an account or place an order, We collect and store some or all of the personal information that you provide. This personal information is used to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations and to provide customer service. This personal information also may be used to contact you about sales, special offers and new site features, unless you have opted not to receive promotional communications in connection with this Website.

We also collect non-personal information about users of the Website. The non-personal information we collect on this Website is information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information and other anonymous statistical data relating to the use of this Website. For example, we collect and store certain non-personal information automatically whenever you interact with this Website, including your IP address, browser information and reference site domain name. We also collect non-personal information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information is used to analyze and improve this Website and to provide Our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience.

Your IP address, browser and reference site domain name are logged every time you visit Our Website. This data is used strictly for the analysis of load information and maximizing the efficiency of Our servers. Except as provided in this privacy policy, we will not share this data with anyone in any way. 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, any communication or material you transmit or post to this Website by email or otherwise, including any data, questions, comments, or suggestions (other than personally identifiable information which will be treated in accordance with this privacy policy), is and will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and anything you transmit or post may be used by Us and Our affiliates for any purpose, including without limitation, reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast, and posting. We are free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any communication or material that you send to this Website for any purpose whatsoever including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products using such information.

Cookies, Web Beacons and Targeted Advertising

Also, like many web sites, We use "cookies," which are files stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser. These cookies help Us identify Our account holders and optimize their shopping experience. They do not include any data that will identify you personally. They will, however, allow you to use some specialized features of the Website. Cookies also allow Us to hold selections in your shopping cart when you leave Our site without checking out. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but allow you to disable them if you wish.

Most browsers provide You with the option to set your browser to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. The last of these, of course, means that certain personalized services cannot then be provided to you and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the features on Our Website.

We may use third-party advertising companies to provide Us with data collection and reporting services regarding Our guests' activities on Our Website, tracking and measuring performance of Our marketing efforts and your response to Our marketing efforts, and the delivery of relevant marketing messages. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness and may receive information about your browsing and buying activity on Our Website. Web beacons enable Us to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits Our Website and to learn which banner ads bring users to Our Website. In addition, We and Our third party service providers may use cookies to manage and track the performance of Our advertisements displayed on other websites across the Internet.

Targeted advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising) uses information collected on an individual's web browsing behavior, such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which of Our advertisements should be displayed to a particular individual on websites other than this Website. The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes from Us or through third party website publishers. If you would like to opt out of targeted advertising that occurs on Our third party advertising publishers, please click here: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>. Please note that this will opt you out of targeted ads from Us and any other participating advertisers. If you opt out, you will continue to receive online advertising from Us; however, these ads may not be as relevant to you.

External Links/Framed Pages

Our store locator functionality links to a third party web site. Any data provided through this functionality is not governed by this Privacy Policy. The privacy policy of the third party web site governs the information collection and dissemination practices occurring on such web site.

If you have accessed this Website through a link from certain of Our advertising and marketing partners, Our Website may include a frame of the applicable advertising and marketing partner.

(However, We will cooperate fully should a situation arise where We are required by law or requested by a law enforcement agency to provide information about a customer.)

From time to time, We use the purchases you make to customize Our product recommendations. We also track customer traffic patterns and site usage. Traffic and usage data is used only to improve Our Website's design and provide Our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience.
