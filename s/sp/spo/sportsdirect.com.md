 **Our commitment**  
Etail Services Limited ("Etail Services") is fully committed to respecting your privacy and to protecting any information you provide to us. Etail Services treats both privacy and security as a priority and makes every effort to ensure that all the information provided by you is protected.   
This policy respects and protects the privacy of all visitors to this web site and the parents of all children visiting this web site. This policy explains how Etail Services collects information from you and how this information is then used.   
Etail Services hopes that this will remove any concerns you may have about supplying information to us and make visiting the sportsdirect.com web site an exciting, fun and safe experience. 

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**  
We reserve the right to change our security and privacy policies at any time. Accordingly we recommend that you check this page periodically in order to review our current policies. 

**What information is collected**  
When you register and order products through this web site you will need to provide your name, email address, mailing address, telephone numbers, date of birth and credit card information (when ordering products only) as well as creating a password. When ordering products and registering on sportsdirect.com, you will also have the option of submitting additional information to us. This allows Etail Services to have a better understanding of visitors to the web site and tailor any specific promotions or features to individual requirements.   
If you enter a competition or other promotional feature Etail Services may once again ask for your name, address, email address, date of birth and password so that we are able to administer and control the competition and of course notify the winners. 

**How your information is used**  
Your information will be used mainly to process your order as well as for administration and marketing purposes. If you become a customer of ours by purchasing goods from us we may send you further information by post or e-mail that is related to your purchase. Sports Direct International Ltd, its group companies and its selected business partners and Etail Services and its selected business partners would like to send you marketing information by post, email or SMS. This will only happen if you have indicated that you are happy to receive such information when you submit your details. We will not make your information available to third parties (other than those identified at 'Sharing your information' below). You can review and change your agreement preferences at any time by clicking on 'My Profile'. We may use your information for statistical purposes.

Etail Services Limited trading as "Etail Services" and "sportsdirect.com" is registered in accordance with United Kingdom Data Protection Legislation, registration number Z9163739 and will hold and use your personal data strictly in accordance with UK data protection legislation. 

**How does Etail Services protect visitor information?**  
Etail Services has a committed Security Policy. Etail Services will retain copies of the information provided when you register on the website, order any products from the site and enter into any competitions. Etail Services implements a number of sophisticated security measures to ensure the safety of any personal information provided. The information is contained on a secure server, which is accessible only by a limited number of employees who have authorised access rights to such information. When you are asked to enter any personal details or credit card information the web site will be secure. This is easily identifiable by an icon in the bottom of the browser window resembling an unbroken key or a closed lock. We use SSL technology to ensure that the information being sent is secure. Your card number will be encrypted and replaced by a unique transaction reference number. Etail Services uses online bank secure servers provided by DataCash and does not hold any customer card details on any Etail Services server at any time. 

**Etail Services Policy for Children**  
Etail Services realises and understands that many children will visit sportsdirect.com but encourages all persons under 13 to consult with their parents or legal guardian before submitting any information to this web site and indeed any other web site. However, Etail Services believes that ultimately it is the responsibility of parents or legal guardian to supervise children when online and recommend that parental control tools be put in place. No information collected from anyone under the age of 18 will be used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatever as is stated when you register for competitions or promotions. Although anyone under the age of 13 is able to participate in competitions and promotions, notification of a win or prize will be sent directly to the parent or legal guardian identified in the initial registration process. Any publication of a competition winner's personal details for visitors under 18 will require parental or legal guardian consent during registration.
