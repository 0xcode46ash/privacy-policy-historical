**SPONGBOB.COM**

 **PRIVACY POLICY**

SpongeBob.com is the place in cyberspace where fans of SpongeBob SquarePants can come to find out more about their favorite SpongeBob characters, play games, and have their opinions heard. SpongeBob.com is made for SpongeBob fans of all ages to use and enjoy. While we encourage the interactive nature of online media, we strive to educate visitors to SpongeBob.com about how to appropriately safeguard their privacy when traveling on the Web. Our online information collection practices are described below. We urge kids to check with their parents before entering information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know. 

**Personally Identifiable Information Collected from Visitors Under 13 years Old:**  
Generally, SpongeBob.com (“the Site”) limits our collection of information from kids under 13 years old to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g., screen name, birthday, gender, state, zip code and country of residence) to enable them to participate in activities (e.g. chat with celebrities, post messages, play online games). From time to time, however, we may request limited personally identifiable information (e.g., kid's email address and/or email address of parent or friend), as explained below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes or offer other online activities (e.g., electronic postcards, newsletters). SpongeBob.com does not condition a kid's participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.

 **Contests and Sweepstakes**  
SpongeBob.com occasionally offers contests and sweepstakes, which may be entered online. For a child under 13 to participate in a contest or sweepstakes, he or she is asked to provide his or her first name and email address. Sometimes, when we conduct contests or sweepstakes that may involve more than a one-time contact, we ask additionally for the email address of his or her parent. In such types of contests or sweepstakes, we send the child's parent an email informing him or her of the child's entry and give the parent the option to have the child's entry deleted. The information in a SpongeBob.com sweepstakes may be passed to a fulfillment house which may use the information to help run the contest or sweepstakes. 

**Electronic Newsletter Subscription**  
SpongeBob.com offers users the opportunity to sign up to receive a SpongeBob.com newsletter by email. When a child under 13 years old asks to receive our email newsletter, the child is asked to provide his or her first name, email address and the email address of his or her parent. We send the child's parent a notification email informing him or her of the child's request to receive by email the SpongeBob.com newsletter on an ongoing basis and give the parent the option to have his or her child's information be removed from our SpongeBob.com newsletter database. At any time after receiving this notification email, the child's parent has the opportunity to exercise the option to request that we stop sending the child the SpongeBob.com newsletter and by following the "unsubscribe" instructions found in either their initial notification email or at the end of any of the SpongeBob.com newsletter emails. In addition, parents may at any time review any personal information collected online about their child that we maintain (see below, Parental Access). 

Personal information collected for SpongeBob.com newsletters from children under 13 years old is used only to send the child the electronic newsletter and may be transferred, disclosed, or shared with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle the preparation and delivery of the electronic newsletter and perform other related technical and processing functions. These third parties may not use it for other purposes and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information.

 **Electronic Postcards and Email Messages**  
SpongeBob.com provides visitors the opportunity to send electronic postcards featuring characters or original artwork to family or friends. Also, SpongeBob.com features information about products that visitors are interested in and from time to time will send, on behalf of visitors who request it, email messages to family and/or friends to let family and/or friends share their interest. We may ask for a child's first name and email address of the recipient of such electronic postcards or email messages. 

SpongeBob.com may also provide the opportunity to send e-mail to us. In these instances, we may ask for first names and an e-mail address, which we use solely for the purpose of responding to messages and/or requests.

Personal information collected for electronic postcards and email messages is used only to send the requested electronic postcard or email message and to respond to email questions and/or requests and is deleted from our system once the electronic postcard, email message or email response is sent.

 **Parental Access**  
At SpongeBob.com we've set up a system by which parents can print out fax us a signed form that allows them to review any identifiable information collected about their child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of their child's information. [You can link to the form from here](http://www.nick.com/blab/site_wide/privacy/personal_info_form.jhtml). SpongeBob.com takes steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child.
