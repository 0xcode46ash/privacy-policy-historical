## Privacy Overview

### Spoke's Philosophy on Privacy

For both our enterprise deployments and on our public web site we believe privacy is not just a feature or a legal document; it is the philosophy on which we founded the company. Privacy permeates everything we build. This focus enables us to design software that we feel comfortable using and recommending to our colleagues and family. Spoke's software analyzes whom you know and how well and aggregates that information to facilitate connections. Allowing Spoke to discover this information for you requires assurances that Spoke will protect that information.

At Spoke, our belief is that privacy is the ability to control your information. Spoke helps you connect with others through people you already know, and we give you numerous options to control your data.

  * You decide which relationships are analyzed. Privacy settings give you fine-grained control over data sources and relationships.  
 
  * You control what types of information is included in your personal contact list. Privacy settings let you decide if phone numbers, addresses, and email communications will be included in your personal SpokeBook. The information in your SpokeBook is visible only to you.  
 
  * You control how you are linked to others. Only people who already have your email address, or those at your company, can send you requests. You can sever links whenever you choose and control privacy levels for each contact.



We believe in openness in our communications on privacy and the incorporation of feedback from our users. We invite you to join the discussion by sharing any comments or concerns with us [information@spoke.com](mailto:information@spoke.com).
