Last revised June 13, 2001 

In addition to reviewing this privacy policy, please read our **[Terms of Service](http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/page.cms?staticId=8)**. Your use of SportsBusinessDaily.com constitutes agreement to its terms and conditions.

SportsBusinessDaily.com is produced by Street & Smith Publications, Inc., a division of American City Business Journals, Inc. This policy does not cover information collected on sites linked to from SportsBusinessDaily.com.

It is the goal of SportsBusinessDaily.com to bring you information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect your privacy. The following is a summary of the various ways we treat the information you provide us while using our site.

SportsBusinessDaily.com only collects personally identifying information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you register for our services, complete a survey, subscribe to our publications, or submit information for editorial purposes, you are asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name or phone number. Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested.

SportsBusinessDaily.com uses this information to provide you with the service you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to our service, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address to send you other offers. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products or services, or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs.

SportsBusinessDaily.com does not sell any of our users' personal information. We may, however, share information with carefully selected companies who we think can offer you services and products of interest to you. If you do not wish to have your information shared, write to us at [info@sportsbusinessdaily.com](mailto:info@sportsbusinessdaily.com). If you do not wish to receive communications from us, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the e-mail. If you've registered on any part of SportsBusinessDaily.com, you may also change or update your member preferences or information at "[My Account](http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/profile.cms)," in the top right corner of the navigation bar on each page.

We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide you with those services. Any third party who has access to our database for this purpose is bound by the terms set forth in this policy. There may also be occasion when we are legally required to provide access to our database in order to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings. In those instances, the information is provided only for that purpose.

You may have read about "cookies," nuggets of information that are placed by a Website in a storage place on your own computer. We use cookies to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns on the site, or to record registration and personalization information. For example, if you register on any part of SportsBusinessDaily.com, you can opt to save your user name and password and other registration information. This cookie "recognizes" your browser when you return to our site so you do not have to log in every time. We also use cookies to control user access to our site.

Our cookies do not contain any information that is, in itself, personally identifying.

Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.

If you don't want cookies, your Web browser likely includes an option that allows you to not accept them. We don't recommend using this option, though: It makes browsing our site a less enjoyable experience.

Finally, while your individual information is protected as outlined above, we reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.

No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information or use our public discussion areas, forums and chats. Minors under the age of 18 are prohibited from making purchases, including subscriptions, on the site.

If your children disclose information about themselves in our public discussion areas, they may get unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, you should tell them not to do so.

If you're worried about your children's activities or their privacy on our sites, we encourage you to send us an e-mail addressed to "Privacy Policy Coordinator" at [info@sportsbusinessdaily.com](mailto:info@sportsbusinessdaily.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Coordinator)
