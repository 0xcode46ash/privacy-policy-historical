At Sports Interaction we are committed to protecting your privacy. The information that we collect is used only to provide you with the best possible online betting experience. We've prepared this statement to demonstrate to you how seriously we take the issue of privacy. The statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.

### Information we collect and how we use it

When you open an account with us, we ask you for your name, address, email address, a unique identifier, and financial information.

We ask you for your name and address so that we can make payments to you via mail or courier. Financial information that is collected is used to process deposits you make to your account.

Overall, personal information is used to ensure the fast and accurate payment of your winnings, and to provide you with the best possible standard of service. We don't collect personal information that is not essential to the provision of these services.

When we ask you for your personal preferences such as your favorite sports, we use this information to deliver website content customized to these preferences.

When you sign up for our "odds by email" service, or our weekly newsletter, we need only an email address, which we use only to send the information you requested.

When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask you for your name, address, and email address so that we can administer the contest and notify winners.

We may occasionally use the information collected to notify you of important changes to the website, new Sports Interaction services, or special offers which we think you may find interesting.

Sports Interaction **does not** sell, rent or trade your personal information. You can be sure that you will never receive any unsolicited email from any third party by providing us with your email address.

### Additional Information

Sports Interaction may from time to time, contact the user directly to acquire more information in order to validate an online transaction or to disburse winnings. This information includes but is not limited to date of birth, address verification and financial verification. In the event of a registration where we receive notice afterwards that a member submitted an inaccurate birth date (upon account creation) and is actually under the legal Age of Majority, we will immediately close their account and delete their personal information.
