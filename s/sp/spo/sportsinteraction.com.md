  * age verification
  * address verification
  * financial verification



In the event of a registration where we receive notice that a player submitted an inaccurate birth date (upon account creation) and is under the legal Age of Majority, we will immediately close their account and delete their personal information.

Sports Interaction may on occasion transfer your data for one or more of the following purposes:

  * the provision of betting services
  * customer service
  * administration of customers' accounts
  * the provision of customer transactions via your banking service provider
  * client identity and money laundering checks
  * risk management and mitigation
  * the provision of a seamless service between the customer's account and other Sports Interaction services which include but are not limited to online casino games and poker.



Sports Interaction may share customer information with third parties for security and fraud prevention purposes, the conduct of authorized games and if required for the administration or enforcement of law or regulations. Our intention is always to create a safer online environment which enhances the customer experience.

### Cookies

We use cookies to track who, how and when players use the site in order to deliver relevant regional and personal information. Cookies contain information volunteered by the player.

A cookie placed by Sports Interaction can only be accessed by Sports Interaction and contains information volunteered by the user, such as their name or user identification number for both player protection and risk mitigation purposes.

Sensitive information is encrypted for security purposes and no information is ever shared with third party marketers.

There are two types of cookies:

**1\. First Party cookies**  
These are cookies set and used by Sports Interaction only to execute basic site and account functions and improve the customer experience. 

There are two types of first party cookies.

  * Session cookies: These are used to allow a user to login to the site. Without them a user session cannot be maintained securely and the site is unusable.
  * Other Cookies: These have an expiration date and are used by Sports Interaction to enable customized site content and user preferences.



**2\. Third party cookies**  
These are cookies used by Sports Interaction for compliance, security and site analysis which are set by a few chosen partners. This information is statistical and anonymous. This information is not used for behavioral advertising purposes. 

Our security cookies reduce fraud and enable us to run a more efficient and safe site.

### IP Addresses

Sports Interaction stores IP addresses (the internet equivalent of a car's license plate number) whenever a customer does something that only he or she is allowed to do. Opening an account, logging in to an account or making a transaction are all occasions when Sports Interaction stores a customer's IP address. IP addresses are stored for security reasons. If a customer logs in with two different IP addresses many thousands of miles apart within a short space of time, the difference in IP address can alert us to a potentially fraudulent event, and we can take the necessary action to maintain customer security. As with all data collected by Sports Interaction, IP addresses are treated with the highest security.

### Security

Sports Interaction recognizes the importance of keeping customer details and payment information safe.

Our systems and processes are annually audited and comply with the toughest security industry standards to prevent customer information from being compromised.

Some of our measures include:

  1. Being Norton secured. Norton is the world's leading Certificate Authority for Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. SSL is a protocol for secure communication over the internet. Being Norton secured ensures all customer transactions with our site are encrypted to the very highest security levels. Norton is the Certificate Authority for forty of the world's largest banks and 95% of Fortune 500 companies.
  2. Annual assessments for compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ([PCI DSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard)), a worldwide information security standard defined by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. The standard helps prevent credit card fraud through increased controls around how we store and use customer data.
  3. Using only Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant cryptography systems to encrypt customer data. [FIPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard) are U.S. government computer security standards which specify the requirements for systems used to encrypt customer data. Our systems meet the highest FIPS standards so that sensitive customer data remains unreadable to anyone who does not have permission to access it, including our employees.



Sports Interaction is registered under the Data Protection (Jersey) Law at the Office Of The Information Commissioner.

Sports Interaction and its security and payment partners may store or process your personal information in Canada, the UK, the USA and Gibraltar.
