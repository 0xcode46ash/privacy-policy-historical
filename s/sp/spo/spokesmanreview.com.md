PRIVACY POLICY

Because your privacy is important to us, The Spokesman-Review.com operates by the following principles:  


**PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
We explicitly ask when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may be needed to provide unique services specific to you, like personal directions or personalized news and information. Other services may need more extensive Personal Information in order to provide a package tailored to a specific individual's needs. Other services that we offer may require more extensive Personal Information in order to provide a package tailored to a specific individual's needs. For example, The Spokesman-Review.com may ask you for your name and e-mail address if you wish to personalize your Spokesman-Review.com home page. Some portions of the site may ask you to provide personal financial information (in addition to Personal Information like name and address) over an encrypted connection, enabling you to purchase items online. We may request that you provide Personal Information as part of a contest or promotion.

We use your Personal Information to operate The Spokesman-Review.com, and we may occasionally inform you of new features, services, and products from The Spokesman-Review.com. In all cases, we will explicitly inform you as to the requirement and/or use of requested Personal Information.

The Spokesman-Review.com may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many users have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. We also may use demographic and preference information to allow advertising banners on our Web site to be targeted, in aggregate, to the users for whom they are most pertinent. This means that users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. In this statistical analyses and banner advertisement targeting, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form. Personal Information about you as an individual member or viewer of our site will not be provided to any third party without your consent, except under the circumstances described in Compliance with Legal Process below.
