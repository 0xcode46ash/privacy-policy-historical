# SpokesmanReview.com -- Privacy policy

Privacy policy  


Because your privacy is important to us, The Spokesman-Review.com operates by these principles: The Spokesman-Review.com is maintained by The Spokesman-Review, 999 West Riverside Ave , WA 99201. 

We can be reached by e-mail at information@spokesman.com.

We explicitly ask when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may be needed to provide unique services specific to you, like personal directions or personalized news and information. Other services may need more extensive Personal Information, in order to provide a package tailored to a specific individual's needs. For example, The Spokesman-Review.com may ask you for your name and e-mail address if you wish to personalize your Spokesman-Review.com home page. Some portions of the site may ask you to provide personal financial information (in addition to Personal Information like name and address) over an encrypted connection, enabling you to purchase items online. We may request that you provide Personal Information as part of a contest or promotion.

We use your Personal Information to operate The Spokesman-Review.com, and we may occasionally inform you of new features, services, and products from The Spokesman-Review.com. In all cases, we will explicitly inform you as to the requirement and/or use of requested Personal Information.

We may also place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable The Spokesman-Review.com to relate your use of The Spokesman-Review.com to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to or requested from The Spokesman-Review.com.

If at any time you believe The Spokesman-Review.com has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by e-mail at information@spokesman.com and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the problem.

If you have questions about this policy, please e-mail us at information@spokesman.com.
