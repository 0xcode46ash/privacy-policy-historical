Use of Cookies and Spyware 

We never use or install spyware on your computer, nor do we use spyware to retrieve information from your computer. 

Like many websites, we use "cookies", which are files saved on your computer's hard drive by your browser and used to collect and store certain information about you. 

Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. The help menu on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies all together. You can also disable or delete cookies you have previously accepted if you wish to. 

We recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better experience on the Website. If you set your browser to block all cookies (including strictly necessary cookies), you may not be able to access parts of the Website. 

We have set certain cookies on your device and recommend that you agree to their use. If you do not, you may still use the Website, but certain parts of it may not work or may not work as well.
