We want kids, teens and adults to have the opportunity to enjoy our site, learn something along the way and to be safe. The privacy of our visitors’ information is very important to us.

For each visitor to our Web page, our site recognizes the consumer’s domain name (if possible). This information is not connected with your name. The domain name information we collect is used for internal review and is then discarded. If you enter your email address for ENews, we use that to distribute our updates. These update emails have an opt-out feature. We do not set any cookies.

We may use Google Adsense, Amazon.com and other third party advertising companies to support our site. As a result of your visit to our site, ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information. For further information, consult the privacy policies of these third party advertisers.

We do not request any credit card or other financial information. While we screen our links and partners, we are not responsible for the content, or safety and privacy practices at any sites linked from our pages.
