Last updated December 10, 2008.

PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. Sponsorpay.com DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO Sponsorpay.com OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED TO IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of Sponsorpay.com

This policy applies to Sponsorpay.com's collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Sponsorpay.com on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to Sponsorpay.com's other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. Sponsorpay.com is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.

**1\. Collection of Information.**

**1.1 Survey Information.**

Sponsorpay.com collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an Sponsorpay.com survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Sponsorpay.com or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to Sponsorpay.com, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). Sponsorpay.com may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Sponsorpay.com or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Sponsorpay.com or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Sponsorpay.com.

**1.2 Third Party List Information.**

Sponsorpay.com collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a third party and Sponsorpay.com subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, Sponsorpay.com seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to Sponsorpay.com and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.

**1.3 Other Information.**

Other occasions when Sponsorpay.com obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Sponsorpay.com or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Sponsorpay.com's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Sponsorpay.com service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").

**1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.**

Sponsorpay.com currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Sponsorpay.com may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").

**(a) Cookies.**

A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Sponsorpay.com to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Sponsorpay.com's database. You may read more about cookies at [http://cookiecentral](http://cookiecentral/). Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.

**(b) Web Beacons.**

A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an <img src="x"> programming function -- see [http://truste.org](http://truste.org/) for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Sponsorpay.com to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Sponsorpay.com might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in Sponsorpay.com's database, visits the fishing website, Sponsorpay.com receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the fishing site, and Sponsorpay.com would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in fishing. Sponsorpay.com may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Sponsorpay.com also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Sponsorpay.com's database.

**(c) New Technology.**

The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Sponsorpay.com's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Sponsorpay.com strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.

**1.5 Outside Information.**

Sponsorpay.com may receive information about individuals from third parties or from other sources of information outside of Sponsorpay.com including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").

**1.6 Individual Information.**

As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information Sponsorpay.com gathers or receives about individuals.

**1.7 No Information Collected from Children.**

Sponsorpay.com will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If Sponsorpay.com obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, Sponsorpay.com has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. Sponsorpay.com has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").

**1.8 Credit Card Information.**

Sponsorpay.com may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from Sponsorpay.com. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Sponsorpay.com, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. Sponsorpay.com will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.

Sponsorpay.com stores the Individual Information in a database on Sponsorpay.com computers. Our computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under Sponsorpay.com's control.
