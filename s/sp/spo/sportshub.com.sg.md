             interests, and for market survey and research purposes; and

             staff.
GS / Document Type: Privacy Policy / Version Date: 02.12.2016 / Version: 1.1 / Page 2


     (b) Optional services
         We may also collect your data if you have indicated that you would like to sign up for
         any of our optional services, such as:
        o    registering for our newsletters, alerts, loyalty or membership programmes;
        o    applying to participate in our promotions, contests, competitions, sweepstakes
             and lucky draws;
        o    signing up to receive information on shows, events, activities, and promotions
             taking place at the SportsHub and/or other venues in Singapore; and
        o    registering with us, participating to our surveys, and/or sending us any enquiries
             or messages (including, complaints, comments and other feedback), via our
             website(s) or otherwise.
     (c) Automatic collection
         We also collect statistical or behavioural data from time to time which is stored for
         analytical purposes. This is not personal data as it is anonymous in nature and does
         not reveal your personal identity. Information of this nature includes but is not limited
         to:
        o    site visit information: server address, date and time of visit, pages accessed,
             information downloaded, type of browser used;
        o    cookies: Cookies are small data files that a website can place on your computer
             hard drives and which record certain technical information about your internet
             usage. SportsHub uses cookies on certain pages of its websites to help improve
             and enhance customer experience, including but not limited to detect your web
             browser’s multimedia capabilities, to track promotional advertisements, to
             maintain current login and purchase information on secure portions of the sites
             and to provide a unique identifier to your computer so that SportsHub can
             generate statistics regarding the site usage. The unique information is not
             matched with any personal data. Most cookies are “session cookies” meaning that
             they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You
             always have the option to decline cookies (if your browser permits you to do so),
             although in that case, you may not be able to use certain features on our websites
             and may be required to enter your password more frequently during a session on
             the sites; and
        o    web beacons: these are electronic images that may be used on our website(s) or
             in SportsHub’s e-mails to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and
             campaign effectiveness and to let us know which emails and links have been
             opened and what action has been taken in relation to those.

(5) Disclosing and transferring your personal data, in Singapore and overseas
   (a) We engage external partners to perform various functions for and on our behalf, such
        as marketing services, events promotion and sponsoring, ticketing and sales services,
        as well as information and communication technology services. Accordingly, we will
        share your data with our partners to the extent necessary to administer any products
        or services you have chosen to receive from us, as well as for market research and
        survey purposes.
   (b) Our partners will not be entitled to use your personal data for their own purposes
        unless you have consented to them doing so (e.g. if you wish to receive information
        about events, promotions and activities taking place at Singapore venues outside
        SportsHub from them).
   (c) We will not share or disclose your personal data to any other third parties (whether for
        marketing purposes or otherwise) without your consent, save as otherwise required or
        permitted by law.
   (d) Please note that the partners (and, with your consent, any other third parties) to whom
        we disclose your information may transfer it to countries outside Singapore. Where
        this is the case, we will comply with our obligations under the PDPA and either seek
        your consent or take appropriate steps (unless we are deemed to have taken such
        appropriate steps under the PDPA) to ensure that the recipients of your personal data
        outside Singapore are bound by legally enforceable obligations to provide a standard
        of protection to your personal data comparable to the protection provided by the
        PDPA and other applicable legislation.
(6) Protecting your data
     (a) SportsHub uses industry standards efforts to protect the confidentiality of your
         personal data, storing data on secure servers and taking other security measures to
         prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying modification,
         disposal or similar risks in relation to your data. We regularly review developments in
         relation to security and encryption technologies.
     (b) However, you will realise that no data transmission over the internet can be
         guaranteed as totally secure and therefore, unfortunately, we cannot ensure or
         warrant the total security of any information transmitted from our online products or
         services.
(7) Accuracy of personal data
   (a) We will take reasonable efforts to ensure that your personal data is accurate and
        complete when we disclose it to our partners and if we disclose it to other third parties
GS / Document Type: Privacy Policy / Version Date: 02.12.2016 / Version: 1.1 / Page 4


        in accordance with this Policy or if it is likely to be used by us to make a decision
        affecting you.
   (b) Please note that, in most circumstances, we will presume that personal data directly
        provided from you will be accurate and complete. However, depending on the
        circumstances, we may decide to contact you to ensure that this is the case or to ask
        that you verify that the data we hold in relation to you is up to date.
(8) Retention of personal data
      (a) We will only hold your personal data for as long as required for the purposes for
           which it was collected or as otherwise required or permitted by law.
      (b) We will regularly review and assess whether personal data can legitimately be
           retained, having regard to the purpose for which it was collected and any other legal
           or business purposes for which retention may be necessary.
      (c) Where we are satisfied that we no longer need to retain your personal data, we will
           take prompt action to ensure that we will no longer hold on to it, either by destroying
           or removing your data from our systems, files and other records completely and
           permanently or by removing any identifying information so that it has become
           anonymised.
(9) Request to access and correct your personal data
     (a) Access to personal data
          a. You may request access to what personal data we hold in relation to you, as well
              as information about how we may have used or disclosed your personal data to
              third parties in the past twelve months, save where we are not required to do so
              by law (for example, where doing so would necessarily reveal personal data
              about other individuals, where investigations or proceedings are ongoing or
              where this would threaten other individuals’ health or safety).
          b. We will carefully review any data access request we receive from you. Please
              note that we may decide to reject your request if we have determined that the
              burden or expense of providing it would be unreasonable to us or
              disproportionate to your interests, if your request concerns information that is
              trivial, does not exist or cannot be found or it otherwise frivolous or vexatious.
              Accordingly, when making any data access request from us, we recommend that
              you set out the circumstances and reasons for your request in as much detail as
              possible to enable us to properly assess the matter.
          c. Please note that we expressly reserves the right to charge an administrative fee
              in relation to any request you make to access personal data we hold and/or have
GS / Document Type: Privacy Policy / Version Date: 02.12.2016 / Version: 1.1 / Page 5


             disclosed to third parties in relation to you in the past twelve (12) months. If we
             decide to do so, we will inform you of the fee we will charge in relation to your
             request beforehand and we will only proceed once we have received confirmation
             from you to that effect.
     (b) Correction of personal data
         You may also request that we correct any errors or omissions with regards to your
         personal data and if so, we will normally ensure that this is made as soon as
         practicable, save where we are satisfied on reasonable grounds that such correction
         should not be made or where we are not required to do so by law.
     (c) Timing of response to data access and correction requests
         a. We will endeavour to respond to your data access and/or correction requests,
             where applicable, within thirty (30) days of your request.
         b. Where we are unable to do so, we will, within that timeframe, inform you of this
             and of the reason(s) for our delay and we will give you an estimated timeframe for
             our response.
         c. In the event where a request is received via e-mail, the identity of the person
             making the request shall be verified by SportsHub before proceeding to make the
             correction.
(10)     Withdrawing consent
         (a) Withdrawing consent for the collection, use and disclosure of personal data
            a. You may withdraw your consent to us and/or our partners collecting, using
                and/or disclosing your personal data at any time by contacting our Data
                Protection Officer (see below).
            b. We will inform you of the likely consequences of us doing so. We will also
                inform our partners of your request and will ensure that we and our partners
                comply with your request, save where otherwise permitted or required by law.
                Please note that we will then delete and personal data we hold about you in
                accordance with the retention principles set out in this Policy.

         (b) Withdrawing consent to receive marketing updates
             a. If you had previously subscribed to receive information on shows, events,
                 activities and promotions taking place at the SportsHub from us or our
                 partners and no longer wish to be on our or our partners’ mailing lists, you
                 may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe link” or by
                 contacting our Data Protection Officer (see below).
             b. If you had previously indicated that you wished to receive information on
                 shows, events, activities, and promotions taking place at other Singapore
                 venues from our partners and you no longer wish to receive such information
                 from them, you will need to get in touch with our partners directly to let them
                 know, either by visiting the privacy policy of their website(s) or by responding
                 to any unsubscribe links to marketing materials which they will be sending
                 you
