What is it? 

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive.

Click “Help” in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions. 

In order to limit the acceptance of or disable “flash” cookies, you must access the management panel of the Adobe Flash Player installed on your computer.

The opt–out works by placing a flash cookie on your computer that notifies Spongecell that no other cookies should be placed on the applicable computer. If this cookie is deleted, then you will need to complete this opt–out process again.
