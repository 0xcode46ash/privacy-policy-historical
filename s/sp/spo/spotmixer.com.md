If you choose to post messages in our chatrooms, bulletin boards, product reviews, or other message areas, we collect the messages you post and use information you provide to improve this Site and our products and services, provide thorough customer service, and follow up on Site visitors who may be violating our policies or abusing our system. When you post messages, other Site visitors can also view them. We may also publish transcripts of archived chats. We urge you to exercise caution when providing personally identifiable financial or other information in the chatrooms, bulletin boards, product reviews or other message areas. Remember that any information you disclose in these areas becomes public information.

In addition to the personal information you supply, we automatically collect non-personal information to evaluate how visitors, guests, and members use the Site. We collect non-personal data to make the Site work better for you in the following ways: to improve the design of the Site, to provide personalization of the Site, and to evaluate the performance of our marketing programs. The technologies we use to gather this non-personal information may include "IP addresses", "cookies", "clear gifs", browser detection, and "weblogs". We explain how these technologies may be used in the next section, "How we use information". 

### How we use information

Our primary goal in collecting your information is to provide you with a personalized, relevant, and positive experience with this Site. We use the personal information you provide about yourself, for example, when placing an order for the Service. SpotMixer will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others, except to the extent necessary to fulfill your order for the Service, to provide you with other services or as set forth in this policy.

We may combine personal data collected at this Site with other information you have provided us through other sources or with non-personal information that we automatically collected at this Site (as further described in this policy).

We use your email address to answer email we receive from you and to provide status updates for the Service. We will not share your email address with outside parties except as set forth in this policy.

You can register on this Site to receive promotions and updates on new products and services, or to be contacted for market research purposes. The contact information you submit will not be used for these purposes unless you specifically "opt-in". You can control your privacy preferences regarding such marketing communications (see the section below entitled "Your privacy preferences and "opting-out"). 

From time to time, you may be invited to participate in optional customer surveys or contests, and SpotMixer may request that you provide some or all of the above listed personal information in those surveys or contests. We use information collected through contests to contact winners and award prizes. We also use information collected from surveys to learn about our customers in order to improve our services and develop new products and services of interest to our customers.

SpotMixer uses "IP addresses", "cookies", "clear gifs", browser detection, and "weblogs" to provide a better experience on this Site and to give us useful business information. Third party technologies such as cookies may also be used for the same purposes.

IP addresses define the Internet location of computers and help us better understand the geographic distribution of our members and manage the performance of this Site. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you visit this Site, so we can immediately recognize you when you return to the Site and deliver content specific to your interests. You may modify your browser preferences to accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or reject all cookies. Please consult your browser instructions for information on how to modify your choices about cookies. If you modify your browser to reject certain or all cookies, you may not be able to use certain features of this Site.

We also use a technology called "clear gifs". Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers that are used to track emails and online movements, helping us understand what marketing campaigns and content are effective.

We detect the type of web browser you are using to optimize the performance of this Site and to understand the mix of browsers used by our visitors, guests, and members. To learn about how people use our Site, we examine weblogs, which show the paths people take through our site and how long they spend in certain areas.

SpotMixer may also contract with unaffiliated third parties to provide services for the Site, such as software for Site features, customer communications, sweepstakes and prize fulfillment, analyzing and evaluating the information we collect, and other services. When we do this, we may provide your personally identifiable information to third parties only to provide those services, and they are not authorized to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

### Our commitment to data security

Access to your data is limited to authorized SpotMixer staff and vendors and restricted by password protection mechanisms. We process all Service orders on a secure server that encrypts all financial information through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Although total security does not exist on the Internet, SpotMixer shall make commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the information that you submit to SpotMixer. We will not store your credit card information in our database unless you provide us such information for use with the Service. Credit card numbers are used for processing payments only and for no other purposes.

### Use of SpotMixer by Children

The products and services offered by SpotMixer are not intended for use by children. SpotMixer will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information submitted by visitors to the site who are under the age of 13.

### Your privacy preferences and opting out

When you sign up as a user of the Service, you may begin receiving marketing communications such as e-mail newsletters, product and service updates, promotions, and contests. Our customers generally find this type of information useful. If you do not want to receive these updates, you must opt-out by unchecking the "Add me to the mailing list" box on the registration page, or should you choose to opt-out after registering, you can use any of the following three methods: 

  * Select the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email and follow the opt-out instructions
  * Go to your member page, select Manage Account, then select Change Communication Preferences and de-select the appropriate box
  * Send email to Unsubscribe@SpotMixer.com from the email account that receives the unwanted messages



### How to access or correct your information

You can access and maintain your personally identifiable information on your "My Account" area. To protect your privacy and security, we require a Member ID and password to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

### Legal disclaimer

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on this Site.

It is possible that we could decide to sell the business or assets associated with this Site or the Service. In any transaction of this kind, customer information, including your personally identifiable information, may be among the assets that are transferred. It is also possible that SpotMixer would sell all or substantially all of its assets and business and in such case customer information, including your personally identifiable information, would almost certainly be among the assets that are transferred. If we sell our business or assets in one of these ways, you will be notified by a notice placed on this Site, by an email to your last known email address, as indicated in SpotMixer's records, or by mail to your last known mailing address, as indicated in SpotMixer's records.

This Site contains links to other websites. SpotMixer is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave this Site, and to read the privacy statements of each web site that collects personally identifiable information. Some linked sites are co-branded with our trademarks and those of our business partners. They may have the look and feel of this Site, but the website address in your browser window will indicate that you are visiting a different website. This statement of privacy practices applies only to information collected by SpotMixer at this Site.
