**Privacy Statement**  
  
   
  
#### Privacy Policy

American Internet respects and protects the privacy of the individuals that use American Internet's web site. Individually identifiable information about you is not willfully disclosed to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in this privacy policy.

**What Information Do We Collect?**

American Internet does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. American Internet may note and save information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, and IP address with each query. That information is used to verify our records and to provide more relevant services to users. For example, American Internet may use your IP address or browser language to determine which language to use when showing search results or advertisements.

**Links to Other Sites**

The sites displayed as search results or linked to by American Internet are developed by people over whom American Internet exercises no control. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.

**With Whom Does American Internet Share Information?**

American Internet may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only divulge aggregate information about our users and will not share personally identifiable information with any third party without your express consent. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average American Internet user visits our web site, or which other query words are most often used with the query word "Linux." Please be aware, however, that we will release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.

**Your consent and changes to the Privacy Policy**

By using the American Internet web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this policy and to our [Terms of Service Policy](http://www.cgi-bin.us/tos.htm). American Internet may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
