**Information Collection**

If you download Spyware Terminator, the program will scan your computer for known threats to your computer, as well as unknown applications and executable files on the computer, and the relevant registry details associated with these applications and executable files. You may elect to have Spyware Terminator compiles this information into a Scan Report and send it to our database. This is the only information collected from your computer at any time. NO PERSONAL INFORMATION is collected unless you fill out your email address in the settings tab and choose to send information to our Spyware Terminator team about threats. In that case, we collect your email address and name so we may answer any questions that you have submitted.

**Sharing Information**

Spyware Terminator does not attempt to determine the identity of its users or correlate the email address, if you volunteered it, to their Web usage. Except as described below, Spyware Terminator does not intentionally disclose personally identifying information collected by our services to any third party without your consent. We do not rent or sell your personally identifiable information.

We disclose any information we possess in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal requirements, and such information might be used by the receiving party to determine your identity, your Web usage and online shopping behavior, or other things about you.

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as technical support services. To perform those functions, it may be necessary for them to obtain access to Spyware Terminator's databases and servers, which may contain any personally identifying information you voluntarily supplied through the Scan Report. These parties are obliged to use the information according to our instructions and they are bound to this Privacy Policy and must apply appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

By using Spyware Terminator services, you are consenting to the transfer of your information where it may be stored and processed by Spyware Terminator and its agents in the facilities maintained in the United States and other countries. If Spyware Terminator ever experiences a transfer of ownership, personally identifiable information can be subject to a different privacy policy. If this is the case, there will be notification prior to any personally identifiable information being transferred.

**Security Measures**

In the event you do choose to send us certain information, we are committed to protecting the security of this information. Access to your information may be necessary and is restricted to those employees who need it in order to provide the service or for service development and improvement purposes.

Spyware Terminator uses commercially reasonable computer security safeguards to protect its databases and servers against risks of loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, or inadvertent or improper disclosure of data. These risks, however, cannot be completely eliminated and therefore Spyware Terminator cannot guarantee complete safety.

**Policy Changes**

Spyware Terminator may change this Privacy Policy at any time at its sole discretion. Notice of material changes to this Policy will be posted on Spyware Terminator's Website or on the service before they become effective. You are responsible for reviewing the notice and any applicable changes.
