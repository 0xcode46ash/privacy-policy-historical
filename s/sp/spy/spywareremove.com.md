### Information Collection and Use

ESG, with its affiliates, is the sole owner of the information collected on its web properties, including this site. ESG collects information from its users at several different points on our Web sites in accordance with the applicable data protection laws and strictly for the purposes necessary to our business and our users’ convenience.

### Registration

In order to use ESG services at any level, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address), and a unique identifier. We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which the user has expressed interest.

### Order

When a user purchases a paying service, we request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.

### Information Use

Subject to the legal exceptions listed in the Privacy Policy, ESG will not disclose to third parties the email addresses uploaded to our Web sites by our users for the purpose of using ESG products or services.

### Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Technologies such as: cookies or similar technologies are used by ESG and our payment processing partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Web site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use cookies for our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference), and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.

This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by ESG Web properties only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

### Log Files

Like most Web sites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

### Flash LSOs

We may use Local Shared Objects (LSOs), such as Flash, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Web site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity may use LSOs such as Flash to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs, please [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html "Adobe Flash Player settings manager").

### Behavioral Targeting/Re-Targeting

We may place ads for our products on various third-party websites and platforms, and as a result, you may see ads for our products when using the Google search engine, when viewing YouTube videos, when using Facebook, and/or in a variety of other places. We may ask the proprietors of these websites/platforms to present our ads to particular demographic groups, such as women over 25 years of age or persons living in California. However, we do not provide any information about you or your browsing behavior to these third-party websites/platforms. The third-party websites/platforms may use information they already have about you, or may place cookies or similar tracking technologies in your browser, in order to decide what ads you will see, including potentially our ads. If you have questions or concerns about the ads you see on any of these third-party websites/platforms or if you have questions generally about their privacy practices, you should consult the privacy policies of those sites or inquire of the proprietors of those sites. Our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider offers a service permitting you to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from certain advertisers. Visit [https://preferences-mgr.truste.com](https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/ "Advertising Choices") for more information. 

### Service Announcements

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. These communications are not promotional in nature.

### Customer Service

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and regarding issues relating to their accounts. We reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.

### Spam

ESG has a zero tolerance policy for abuse.

### Information Sharing

We will share your personally identifiable information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personally identifiable information to third parties.

### Legal Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personally identifiable information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety, the safety of others or investigate fraud. For example, ESG may disclose personally identifiable information to law enforcement, other government officials, or third parties in response to criminal or civil subpoenas. In certain situations, ESG may be required to disclose personally identifiable information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. 

### Third Party Intermediaries

We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. These companies are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

### Business Transitions

In the event ESG goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personally identifiable information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified prior to a change of ownership or control of their personally identifiable information. If as a result of the business transition, the users’ personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given a choice not to have their information used in this different manner, as described in the notification of changes section, below.

### Links

ESG’s Web sites contain links to other sites. Please be aware that ESG is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our sites and to read the privacy policies of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by ESG’s Web sites. ESG has advertising and affiliate relationships with dozens of third party sites which drive interested parties to our sites. Information that is collected on these sites does not fall within the auspices of this policy.

### Surveys

Periodically, our site may request information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user, therefore, has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of ESG’s services. Users’ personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys, they may not use customers’ personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

### Blog

Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personally identifiable information from our blog or community forum, contact us at support@enigmasoftware.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personally identifiable information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

### Social Media Widgets

Our Web site includes social media features, such as a Facebook “Like” button and widgets, such as a “Share This” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

### Security

ESG takes every precaution to protect its users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via ESG’s Web sites, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with an industry-standard encryption protocol – SSL. While on a secure page, such as our paid order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just “surfing.”

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also employ security measures to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted on our servers. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerks or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at support@enigmasoftware.com.

### Supplementation of Information

In order for ESG to properly fulfill its obligations to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. ESG verifies the billing address on all credit card transactions and may obtain credit reports for some corporate customers. The information obtained from these third party sources is maintained in a manner consistent with ESG’s Privacy Policy.

### Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personally Identifiable Information

Upon request ESG will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personally identifiable information. If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. You can make the change by accessing your account online or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. As a result, historical customer billing records may be maintained indefinitely, by ESG and by third-party payment processing companies.  
We will not merge your personally identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information for the purpose of online preference marketing without obtaining your permission.

### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes in this privacy policy, and other places we deem appropriate, so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email or by means of notice on our Web site prior to the change becoming effective. We will also notify users via an in-app mechanism prior to the change becoming effective. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. In addition, if we make a material change in our privacy policy that does not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site and via the in-app mechanism notifying users of the change.
