# Privacy Policy – SpywareRemove.com

This Privacy Policy was last revised on 1/23/09.

SpywareRemove.com is dedicated to establishing a trusting relationship with its users, based on respect for personal identity and information, by promoting the use of fair information practices. This Privacy Policy covers all Web properties owned and maintained by SpywareRemove.com, including but not limited to www.spywareremove.com. Because SpywareRemove.com wants to demonstrate its commitment to our users’ privacy, we are disclosing:

a. What personally identifiable information SpywareRemove.com collects.  
b. How SpywareRemove.com uses the information.  
c. With whom SpywareRemove.com may share user information.  
d. What choices are available to users regarding collection, use and distribution of the information.  
e. What types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under SpywareRemove.com control.  
f. How users can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should contact SpywareRemove.com Customer Support.

**Information Collection and Use**

SpywareRemove.com is the sole owner of the information collected on its web properties, including www.spywareremove.com. SpywareRemove.com collects information from its users at several different points on our Web sites.

**Registration**

In order to use SpywareRemove.com services at any level, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address), and a unique identifier. We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which the user has expressed interest. By providing SpywareRemove.com your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You may not opt out of service-related e-mails. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the service, or special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/ "contacting us") and sending an email message with the word “No email” in the subject field. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.

**Children’s Privacy**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information on our Web properties from users who we actually know to be under the age of 13. No parts of our Web properties are structured to attract anyone under 13.

**Order**

When a user purchases a paying service, we request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.

**Information Use**

We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about SpywareRemove.com, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the purposes specified by SpwareRemove.com. This information is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: In order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the TOU, or as otherwise required by law.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For the session cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in with a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising.

This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by SpywareRemove.com Web properties only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**Log Files**

Like most Web sites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Sharing**

Legal Disclaimer

Although we make every reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on one of our Web sites. For example, SpywareRemove.com may disclose personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or third parties in response to criminal or civil subpoenas.

**Third Party Intermediaries**

We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

**Business Transitions**

As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.

**Links**

SpywareRemove.com’s Web sites contain links to other sites. Please be aware that SpywareRemove.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our sites and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by SpywareRemove.com’s Web sites. SpywareRemove.com has advertising and affiliate relationships with dozens of third party sites which drive interested parties to our sites. Information that is collected on these sites does not fall within the auspices of this policy.

**Surveys**

Periodically, our site may request information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of SpywareRemove.com’s services. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys, they are not authorized to use customers’ personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

**Security**

SpywareRemove.com uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to SpywareRemove.com and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, SpywareRemove.com makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

When our registration/order forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption protocol in the industry – SSL. While on a secure page, such as our paid order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also employ security measures to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerks or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.

**Supplementation of Information**

In order for SpywareRemove.com to properly fulfill its obligations to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. SpywareRemove.com verifies the billing address on all credit card transactions and may obtain credit reports for some corporate customers. The information obtained from these third party sources is maintained in a manner consistent with SpywareRemove.com’s Privacy Policy.

**Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information**

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information.

**Notification Procedures**

It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our Web site page, as determined by SpywareRemove.com in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Notification of Privacy Policy Changes**

We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes in this Privacy Policy, and other places we deem appropriate, so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of any of our Web sites, or your dealings with any of our Web sites, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/ "contact us").
