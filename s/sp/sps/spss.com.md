# SPSS Inc. - Privacy Policy

SPSS Inc. is certified under the Safe Harbor framework of the European Union's 1995 Directive on Data Protection. This means that SPSS has demonstrated to the U.S. Department of Commerce that the company complies with the data privacy and security Principles as outlined by the Department at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/sh_overview.html>. Those principles derive from what are often called "Fair Information Practices"â€”internationally recognized standards designed to provide people with a certain amount of control over the personal data that they provide to various organizations. They are policies that have been invoked in various forms for over twenty years, and have generally been effective in keeping people informed about the information they are disclosing, how it is used, and how they may affect how it is used.

1\. What information does SPSS collect from me, and how does SPSS use it?

**SPSS collects information necessary to conduct business with you and, optionally, information about how you use SPSS products so that we may better tailor them to customer needs. We also collect information about how people make use of our web site so we can make that experience more effective.**


SPSS gathers three types of information: (1) information that current and prospective customers provide in the course of purchasing products or services from SPSS or expressing an interest in doing so; (2) information that web site visitors actively provide through optional registration on our site; and (3) information that web site visitors may passively provide when browsing the SPSS web site. In all cases, the amount and type of information you disclose to SPSS is at your discretion; you can choose not to provide us with information you don't wish to share. In some cases, however, this cannot be done selectively, and opting not to provide certain types of information may amount to non-participation in particular features and thus may affect the services available to you from SPSS.

[Click here](https://web.archive.org/privacy_q1.htm) for a more detailed account of the occasions on which SPSS might collect information from you. Please note that for any of the information described, SPSS may transfer it to a secure location in the United States, regardless of where you might reside. 

2\. With whom does SPSS share the personal information it collects?

**SPSS does not share information it collects from you with other organizations that intend to use it for their own commercial purposes. We only share information with organizations who perform services for us, and only if they agree to restrict their use of your information to these purposes.**


SPSS does not, unless required by law, disclose your personal information to people or organizations outside of SPSS whose stated aim is to use it for any purpose other than to process your registration, fulfill your requests to SPSS, keep you informed about SPSS products and services, or some other task that SPSS asks them to perform on our behalf.

[Click here](https://web.archive.org/privacy_q2.htm) for a description of the specific circumstances under which your information might be disclosed to someone else.

SPSS occasionally works ("partners") with organizations that provide products or services we think you might be interested in. We do not share your information with these organizations; we would at most draw your attention to them by sending a message to you on their behalf if you had already consented to receiving similar messages about SPSS products and services. For these partner organizations to obtain any personal information about you, you would have to provide it to them yourself.

3\. How can I review and update my personal information and preferences?

**If you've registered at the SPSS web site, you can review and update information you provide there via the website itself. You can update information you've provided by other means by contacting SPSS and specifying what changes should be made.** 


SPSS offers you the ability to correct and update the information you've previously provided to us. If you've registered at the SPSS web site, you can do this by visiting the registration page on the SPSS web site (<http://www.spss.com/registration/login/regform020.cfm>). When you are logged in, you will be able to view this information and make any adjustments. You may change this information at any time and as often as you like. In addition to changing your personal contact and registration information, you may also change your preferences as to the types of contact you wish to receive or not receive from SPSS (see question 4 below for details on this). 

If you have not registered at the SPSS web site, or provided information there that effectively registers you (e.g., in order to download a white paper), you may not be able to see the information SPSS holds regarding you at the registration page. SPSS web site registration allows you to establish password protection of your profile information, so that only you can directly access this information. We encourage you to register there, even if it means supplying information you might have provided to SPSS on a different occasion and through other means.

Even if you don't register at the SPSS web site, however, you can still instruct SPSS to change the personal information we have regarding you. Do this by sending an e-mail with your request to [dbupdate@spss.com](mailto:dbupdate@spss.com) or by sending a note via postal mail to DB Update, SPSS Inc., 233 South Wacker Drive, 11th Floor, Chicago, IL, 60606, USA. Be sure to specify the information as we currently have it (include a mailing label or the exact information as it appears on the label) and what you would like it changed to.

4\. How can I opt out of electronic correspondence from SPSS?

**You can opt out of electronic correspondence from SPSS via our web site, via the instructions provided in the correspondence itself, or by contacting SPSS and requesting to be removed from our mailing list.**


SPSS sends electronic newsletters to web registrants and customers on a periodic basis, which varies according to the content you might choose to receive. We occasionally send out special communications when we think subscribers or customers might be particularly interested in something we are doing or a product or service we are offering, or when we wish to survey subscribers and customers.

You can opt out of all unsolicited electronic correspondence in any of three ways:

  1. You can follow the instructions embedded in the particular types of correspondence you have received that indicate how to opt out of receiving unsolicited correspondence in the future; some types of correspondence we send will allow you to specify whether you wish to opt out of that particular type of message or all unsolicited messages from SPSS;
  2. You can register at the SPSS web site (see question #3 above) and deselect the checkbox item for "e-mail" under "Communication Methods"; or
  3. You can send an e-mail note with your opt-out request to [dbupdate@spss.com](mailto:dbupdate@spss.com) or a letter to DB Update, SPSS Inc., 233 South Wacker Drive, 11th Floor, Chicago, IL, 60606, USA; when contacting us in this way, please be sure to specify which e-mail addresses you wish to be removed from our mailing list. 



5\. How does SPSS secure my information?

**SPSS takes a variety of measures to secure your information from unwarranted access and accidental loss.**


SPSS takes extensive measures to ensure that information you provide to us is protected from corruption and from unlawful access. In addition to the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology mentioned above, SPSS uses intrusion-detection technologies as well as data encryption technologies that help to render your information inaccessible to anyone but the SPSS employees directly involved in the activities described above. 

6\. How will I know if the SPSS Privacy Policy changes?

**SPSS will inform all contacts who provide us with their e-mail addresses of any substantive change to this privacy policy.** 


If we need to change the conditions of the SPSS Privacy Policy, we would like to be able to reach by e-mail as many people as possible to inform them of those changes, so that they may review any new conditions and update their information or preferences accordingly. Consequently, even if you've opted out of receiving e-mail from SPSS, you might still receive such a notice, since it pertains to the very practices that ensure we have only the information you wish us to have and use it for purposes of which you approve.

7\. To whom should I address questions about the privacy of my information held by SPSS? What can I do if I think SPSS has not adhered to this Privacy Policy and my privacy has been affected?

**You can direct questions and reports of possible breaches of this privacy policy to the SPSS Privacy Analyst.**


Questions and concerns about the SPSS Privacy Policy and its enforcement may be addressed to [privacy@spss.com](mailto:privacy@spss.com).

If you have reason to believe that SPSS has not adhered to the standards specified in this Privacy Policy, the SPSS Privacy Analyst will investigate your concerns and propose an appropriate remedy on behalf of SPSS. If you are not satisfied with this resolution, you may refer your complaint to a higher dispute resolution authority. SPSS will cooperate fully with the Federal Trade Commission on behalf of U.S. residents and the Data Protection Authorities of any European Union nation on behalf of its residents.
