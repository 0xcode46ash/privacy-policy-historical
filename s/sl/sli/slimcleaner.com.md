**We never knowingly collect any personal data from a person or persons under the age of eighteen.**

A cookie is a small string of information that is stored automatically on your computer when you access our servers. Products distributed by SlimWare Utilities use cookies, so defined, to provide our customers and affiliates with faster services, to deter Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on our servers, to facilitate the proper distribution of sales credit to our partners and to deter fraudulent transactions.

To safeguard your privacy, every cookie assigned to a system that accesses our servers is non-unique and non-identifiable. All cookies distributed by SlimwareUtilities.com or by any Slimware Utilities subsidiary Web-service can be designated as secure and non-invasive by the following criteria: 

  * The cookies are visible only to SlimWareUtilities.com
  * The cookies are smaller than 5KB in length
  * The cookies are of a limited duration
  * The cookies contain no personally identifying information
  * The cookies are not unique to a given computer system



Slimware Utilities products use cookies to track affiliate sales. They are NOT used to build customer profiles. This tracking process allows Slimware Utilities to assign correct payment to affiliates for their sales and for tracing activities directly related to their affiliate relationship with us. 

To protect your personally identifying information, we store all transaction records on servers with limited-access, meaning they are accessible only through encrypted means. This is done to not only secure your personal data but to protect the servers themselves from any outside harm. Once it is retained, we only keep personally identifying information long enough to complete a transaction, to deter fraud, to provide customer service, and/or to maintain your account with us. If one or more of these stated conditions is not applicable to your relationship with us, we delete the personally identifying information.

We may use information in the following ways: 

  * To process, validate and verify purchases.
  * To register you as a customer of a Slimware Utilities Product, namely SlimCleaner. This process facilitates the creation and maintenance of a customer support account on your behalf.
  * To send out email notifications concerning existing products or new products and/or services. Emails are also sent out to notify you of special offers when such offers become available, and to contact you to confirm or verify (if needed) the accuracy of information provided to us.
  * To obtain feedback so we can enhance existing product features or provide additional products and services.

We retain the right to disclose personally identifying information in special circumstances wherein it is necessary to protect our service or enforce our agreements. We reserve the right to invoke this disclosure if doing so will help us protect our intellectual property rights. We may also disclose or use personally identifying information if and when we believe, in all good faith, that doing so is required by law.

We never sell or distribute any personally identifying information to third parties for purposes of advertising or for any purposes outside the bounds set forth in this policy statement. 

Neither Slimware Utilities nor any of its subsidiary products, including SlimCleaner, collect personally identifying information from your computer. All Slimware Utilities products are equipped with a full-access install sequence and upon uninstallation, no Slimware Utilities product leaves any active or executable data on your computer. What is left is an inert, text-based log file. This file is deposited in an accessible directory on your hard drive. It indexes events that have occurred in the course of using the Slimware Utilities product. Such events include, but are not limited to, listing corrected errors. This file is left as a courtesy to our customers. It can be easily deleted of so desired. If retained, it can be used by support technicians as a reference, whether or not those technicians are associated with Slimware Utilities.  


All Slimware Utilities products routinely communicate with our server to get active feedback concerning application ratings. This feedback constitutes either volunteered ratings of software or ongoing updates to the programs' respective databases. These updates allow for better and more accurate optimization plans. The only personal data transmitted to the server in such a communication is the version of the software product (SlimCleaner) currently installed on your PC. The formation of a personalized customization profile is done locally and not on our servers. You have the option to discontinue automatic updates at any time. This update process can be managed and/or disabled via the Settings dialog in the respective application. By default, the updates for Slimware Utilities products are downloaded only after you are notified of their availability and have subsequently given consent for download.

We reserve the right to, from time to time, change this Privacy Policy without notice. Any and all changes will be posted here, so please check this page regularly for the most up-to-date information.
