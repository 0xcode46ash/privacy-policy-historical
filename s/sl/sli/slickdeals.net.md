**Personal Information**.  
Whenever Slickdeals obtains your Personal Information, Slickdeals uses commercially reasonable efforts to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure.

You may be able to access third-party web sites directly from the Slickdeals Web Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply when you access such web sites.
