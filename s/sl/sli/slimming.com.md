SLIMMING.COM LTD. also uses personal information in an aggregate form (i.e., not individually attributable to you) for its business analysis, operational, marketing and other promotional purposes.

If we hire other companies to provide some products or services on our behalf, then we will only provide those companies the personal information they need for the Identified Purposes, and we will limit their rights to use and further disclose your personal information as appropriate in the course of their work for us.

**4\. Limiting the Collection of Personal Information**

SLIMMING.COM LTD. limits its collection of personal information to only that information which is necessary for the Identified Purposes. SLIMMING.COM LTD. does not direct its site to, nor does it knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen.

(b) to SLIMMING.COM LTD.' employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, consultants, business associates, service providers, suppliers and agents, acting on SLIMMING.COM LTD.'s behalf for any of the Identified Purposes;   
(c) as necessary if SLIMMING.COM LTD. has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with SLIMMING.COM LTD.' rights or property, other users of SLIMMING.COM LTD.' web site, products or services, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and   
(d) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law.

In addition, as we continue to develop our business, we may sell or buy other businesses or entities, or we may merge with another company. In such transactions, personal information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that SLIMMING.COM LTD. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets.

Your information may be stored and processed in the U.K., or in any other country in which SLIMMING.COM LTD. or its subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. By using this web site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

After your account becomes inactive (that is, if you request to be removed from our database), SLIMMING.COM LTD. will keep your personal information in its archives. Your information will then be used only as necessary for tax reasons or to prove SLIMMING.COM LTD.' compliance with any applicable law.

**6\. Accuracy of Personal Information**

SLIMMING.COM LTD. will use reasonable efforts to keep customer personal information accurate for the Identified Purposes, and for minimizing the possibility of making inappropriate customer decisions based on such information. Customers are responsible for informing SLIMMING.COM LTD. about changes to their personal information. You can do this by calling 0115 9798445.
