# Sleep Train - Privacy Policy

  
  
At Sleep Train we are committed to ensuring the privacy of our customers. This privacy policy explains Sleep Train’s privacy practices, including those of our Web site located at [www.sleeptrain.com](http://www.sleeptrain.com/ "Sleep Train") (“Site”), for our customers who purchase our products and services. By using our Site, you consent to the terms of this privacy policy.

**What is Personal Information?**  
Personal information is information that specifically identifies an individual such as a customer’s name, address, telephone number, e–mail address, credit card or other account number, and information about that individual’s activities when directly linked to that person such as information about his or her purchases. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you.

Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products you purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products purchased by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and services to customer desires.

**Personal Information We Collect**  
You provide personal information to us in a number of ways when you visit our Site. For example, you provide us with personal information when you: (1) purchase products and services, (2) submit a warranty registration, and (3) contact us by email for any reason (such as to request customer service or provide us with your comments/feedback). We collect your name, billing and shipping addresses, email address, phone number, fax number and credit card information in this manner. We also collect personal information from you if you submit an online job application or resume to us, including your name and email address, as well as other employment related information hat you provide to us at your option.

When you visit our Site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer’s operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and the time and date of your visit and purchases. This information is collected through the use of “cookies.” Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by a web site to give you a unique identification. We use cookies on our Site to help optimize your shopping experience. For example, we use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to store your shipping information for delivery of future orders. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the personally identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.

**How We Use Personal Information**  
In general, we use personal information to process your requests or transactions and provide you with high-quality products and services or to inform you about other products or services we think will be of interest. For example, we use your information to deliver products or provide services you have purchased. When we use personal information in our internal marketing efforts, we provide you with choices (See Choice below) and do not disclose the information to third parties except as described in this privacy policy. We may also receive information from third parties with whom we have business relationships, and will combine this information with the other personal information we maintain about you. In such cases, this privacy policy governs this information.

**Sharing of Personal Information**  
We do not sell, rent or share personal information with third parties without your prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this privacy policy. We share personal information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing internal functions necessary to operate our business. These functions may include, for example, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and fulfilling/delivering orders. We require our third party vendors to keep such information confidential and to only use the information for the purpose it was provided. We are not responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them.   
We also disclose personal information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this privacy policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our customers´ rights, property or safety; to protect our customers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, our Site; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.   
In addition, information about our customers, including personally identifiable information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets of the company.
