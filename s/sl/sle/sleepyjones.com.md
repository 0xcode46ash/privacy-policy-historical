Thank you for visiting Sleepy Jones, LLC (“Sleepy Jones” or the “Company”) and our web site, [www.sleepyjones.com](http://www.seedandspark.com/), or any other site owned or operated by the Company (collectively, the “Site”) and using our services (the “Services”) and reviewing our Privacy Policy. Your privacy is important to us and we recognize that you may have concerns regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) which we may gather during your use of the Site and the Services. This Privacy Policy informs you of the information we collect, the way we collect it, and what is done with it. This Privacy Policy does not describe information collection practices on other sites, including those linked to or from the Site nor any other companies or persons associated with the Services.

**Changes to Privacy Policy.**

We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If there is a change to our usage practices that affects your Personal Information, we will notify you of the relevant changes by email or by posting a notice on the Site. When Sleepy Jones sends or posts a Privacy Policy change notice, you will need to review the new Privacy Policy features carefully so you understand our procedures and practices. Any changes to this Privacy Policy are effective immediately upon the posting of such changes. Please be advised that our rights to use your Personal Information will be based on the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of any such use. 

**Collection of Information.**

The Personal Information we collect is used to identify you, including your name, physical address, email address, telephone number, financial information, log-in and password details, and details of transactions made by you through the Service. Personal Information is collected when you register with the Site, purchase products on the Site, upload or post content, use the Services, or visit the Site.  We also collect your communications with Sleepy Jones with respect to the Site and the Services. Your Personal Information is used for our internal purposes to improve and personalize the Services for you and to provide excellent partner and customer support, as well as to identify you when you sign in to your account, to enable us to provide you with the Service, to process and fulfill orders for products, to send you information you may find useful or which you have requested from us, to administer your account, to enable us to contact you, and for other purposes that we disclose to you when we request your Personal Information.  By providing Sleepy Jones your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail.  We may also use your email address to send you other messages, including confirmations and information regarding product orders, changes to features of the Service and special offers.

Additionally, we collect certain non-personal default information customarily logged by web server software. Such information may include your originating IP address, the date and time of your visit, your browser type, the previous site you visited, the content you upload and review and Services you use, the products you review and order, and the pages and images requested. Non-personal information is used to maintain, evaluate, and improve the Services.

**Security of Information.   **

We use commercially reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Information from disclosure or unauthorized access. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished if you are using a shared computer. Sleepy Jones is not liable for disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized access or acts by third parties, or omissions or acts beyond Sleepy Jones’s reasonable control. Sleepy Jones does not guarantee that your Personal Information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. ****

**Information Shared with Third Parties.**

Generally, Sleepy Jones will not provide your Personal Information to any third parties except as reasonably necessary in the performance of the Services or otherwise in order to operate our business.  We may use third parties to maintain or perform certain parts of the Services, such as order fulfillment, shipping, payment processing, marketing, website evaluation, fraud protection, data collection and storage, and other services to assist us in maximizing our business potential.  We use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such third parties from using or disclosing your Personal Information for any reason other than the service they are providing in connection with the Services. However, we cannot and do not guarantee that such third parties will not use or disclose your Personal Information. If Sleepy Jones is acquired, merged with another entity, or if substantially all of our assets are acquired for any reason, we may disclose your Personal Information to any successor-in-interest of Sleepy Jones. Additionally, we may disclose your Personal Information in the case of an emergency or as required or permitted by law, or to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of a third party. For example, if a third party alleges that you have infringed their intellectual property rights, we may disclose your Personal Information as it relates to such allegations. We may also provide your Personal Information to other companies or organizations for credit fraud protection and risk reduction.

Sleepy Jones may use certain information about you and/or content or information you submit to the Site without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing advertisements and promotions.  We may store Personal Information in locations outside the direct control of Sleepy Jones (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).

Any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas of the Site becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by other users of the Site. You should exercise caution before disclosing your Personal Information through these public venues.

**Use of cookies.**

Cookies help us personalize your experience with Sleepy Jones.  We use cookies to keep track of how customers are navigating the Site and to allow us to provide you with personalized content.  Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the Service. When you enter the Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer which allows us to recognize your computer but not specifically who is using it. By associating the identification numbers in the cookies with other customer information when, for example, you log-in to the Site or use the Service, we know that the cookie information relates to you. Some of the cookies used by our Service are served by us, and some are served by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf.

**Updating Your Information.**

You can review, correct and update your information by email or by logging onto the Site and making the appropriate changes in your personal profile.  We may retain certain information as required by law or for necessary business purposes.

**Web Sites linked to Sleepy Jones.**

Sleepy Jones is not responsible for the information practices employed by websites linked to or from the Site. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Site to another website, Sleepy Jones’s Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link on the Site, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.

**Children’s Privacy Issues**

People under 18 years of age are not permitted to use the Site or the Services on their own, and so this Privacy Policy makes no provision for their use of the Site.  We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Service. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information through the Service, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

**Governing Law and Jurisdiction**

This Privacy Policy constitutes a contract made under and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
