**SLUGGY FREELANCE USES PERSONAL INFORMATION IN SEVERAL SEPARATE WAYS. HERE'S DETAILED INFORMATION, AND WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT:**

**1.     Ordering shirts:**

> When you order shirts (or buttons) from Sluggy Freelance, we ask for a valid e-mail address, and your shipping information.  This information is _**only**_ used to get your order to you, and is never used for any other other purpose, or transmitted to any other agency.  
>  If you wish to not give us your e-mail address, that's fine. However, if we are unable to contact you via e-mail about questions we have with your order, we may just have to use our "best guess" as to what you meant (ie, shirt sizes, color choices, etc.).  
>  (Technically, we suppose you don't have to give us your shipping address, either, but then we'd just have to keep your stuff for our own ;-)

**2.     Advertising**

> Sluggy Freelance makes use of advertising from Burst Media.  For information on their privacy policy, please go to:  
>  <http://www.burstmedia.com/release/privacy.asp>.
> 
> For all non-Burst advertising that Sluggy Freelance makes use of, no information about you is collected.  However, if you follow an advertisement link to a sponsor's site, the sponsor may have their own privacy policy that you should read.

**3.     Ad-Free Sluggy **

> [Ad-Free Sluggy](http://www.sluggy.com/auth/adfree.php) is an optional service we offer to let you avoid ads, as well as sometimes offering other benefits (see the link for details). If you make use of this service, the site will use cookies to enable you to log in, but will not retain or keep track of this data in any way.
> 
> At the time when you decide to register for the service, we'll ask you for an e-mail address to verify your account.  The address is retained so that if you lose your password or other information, we can reset it for you and send you the new information.  This e-mail address is used **_only_** for that purpose, and is never sold, transferred, lent, or misplaced :) If you'd like us to delete this information from our database anyway, send a note to Tom at [tom@sluggy.com](mailto:tom@sluggy.com) and we'll erase it (but then we can't help you if you lose your password).
