**SLUGGY FREELANCE USES PERSONAL INFORMATION IN TWO SEPARATE WAYS. HERE'S DETAILED INFORMATION, AND WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT:**

**1.     Ordering shirts:**

> When you order shirts (or buttons) from Sluggy Freelance, we ask for a valid e-mail address, and your shipping information.  This information is _**only**_ used to get your order to you, and is never used for any other other purpose, or transmitted to any other agency.  
>  If you wish to not give us your e-mail address, that's fine. However, if we are unable to contact you via e-mail about questions we have with your order, we may just have to use our "best guess" as to what you meant (ie, shirt sizes, color choices, etc.).  
>  (Technically, we suppose you don't have to give us your shipping address, either, but then we'd just have to keep your stuff for our own ;-)

**2.     Advertising**

> This site, Sluggy Freelance, uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, Engage collects anonymous data through the use of cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out of the Engage system, go to <http://www.engage.com/privacy>.
> 
> Sluggy Freelance also makes use of advertising from Burst Media.  For information on their privacy policy, please go to:
