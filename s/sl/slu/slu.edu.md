  * Are permitted to do so under US federal and state regulations, the LOPD and the GDPR.



**Legal basis for processing your information**

Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. 

However, we will normally collect personal information from you only:

  * Where we have your consent to do so,
  * Where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or
  * Where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you. 



If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we’ll make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences if you do not provide your information). 

Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we’ll make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are. 

By enrolling as a SLU student, you understand that SLU will be collecting, storing, using and otherwise processing data about you for any purposes connected with your studies, your health and safety, to protect the vital interests of others, as required in compliance with a legal obligation, to perform tasks in the public interest, and for other legitimate reasons while you are a student. We will also use your data for certain purposes after you cease to be student (alumni relations). 

SLU will only use your data fairly and lawfully in accordance with our obligations under the LOPD and the GDPR. This means that we will process your data in a way which respects the principles of data protection and your rights under US federal and state regulations, the LOPD and the GDPR. Any use by SLU of your data must also be covered by our registration with the [Information Commissioner's Office](http://www.agpd.es/portalwebAGPD/index-ides-idphp.php). This is available on the Commissioner's website, and describes in a general way how we process personal data about students and other individuals. 

US federal and state regulations, the LOPD and the GDPR require us to keep your data secure. This means that your confidentiality will be respected, and all appropriate measures will be taken to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Only members of staff who need access to relevant parts, or all of your data, will be authorized to do so. 

Although it is not possible to state every purpose for which your information will be used, the following are examples of how it is likely to be used while you are a student: 

  * To administer your studies and record academic achievements (e.g. your course choices, examinations and assessments, and the publication of pass lists and graduation programs). 
  * To assist in pastoral and welfare needs (e.g. the counseling service and services to students with disabilities). 
  * To administer financial aspects of your registration as a student (e.g. payment of fees, debt collection). 
  * To manage University facilities, such as computing facilities, the Library and parking.
  * To produce management statistics and to conduct research into the effectiveness of our programs of study. 
  * To monitor our equal opportunities policies.
  * To administer employment processes, if you choose to work for SLU.
  * For security and disciplinary purposes.
  * For internal and external audits, and quality assurance exercises.
  * For administration of apprenticeships, workplace and end-point assessments
  * For marketing and alumni relations purposes. We may use your data to identify individuals who may be interested in helping to promote SLU or working for US ambassadors. When you leave SLU you will be contacted by the Alumni Office. 
  * For fundraising purposes, such as appeals, events or opportunities to support the activities of SLU (for example in sponsoring a scholarship for a prospective or former student) 
  * Your photo taken at registration, or provided by you at registration, will be used for providing various identity documents, including identity badge, exam entry and access around the campus. It will also be used by staff at SLU for identifying students within teaching groups.
