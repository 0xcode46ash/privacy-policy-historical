# SLCo: Organization:

**General**  
Salt Lake County (SLCo) respects the privacy of every individual who visits our websites. This Privacy Statement outlines the information Salt Lake County will collect and how Salt Lake County will use that information. 

**Personally Identifiable Information**  
When you visit SLCo websites, we will not collect any personally identifiable information about you (such as your name, address, telephone number, social security number or e-mail address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily. SLCo may request personally identifiable information from you in order to provide requested specialized services. 

**Use of Personally Identifiable Information**  
SLCo may store and process your personally identifiable information to better understand your needs and how we may improve our electronic services, and we may use your personally identifiable information to contact you if so requested by you (for example, we may send you a questionaire or we may respond to your comments or requests for information). SLCo will not give your personally identifiable information to any outside organization. 

**Non Personally Identifiable Information**  
SLCo may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include IP address, time of visit, the type of internet browser or computer operating system you are using and the domain name of the website from which you linked to our sites. SLCo uses this information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. We also use it to gather broad demographic information about our users in general. This information does not contain anything that can identify users personally. Additionally, SLCo may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie". Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. SLCO will not attempt to tie any personally identifiable information on individual users to non personally identifiable information. 

**Security**  
SLCo is committed to keeping secure the data you provide us and will take reasonable precautions to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, misuse or alteration. 

**Non SLCo Websites**   
SLCo links to various non SLCo websites. SLCo is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of websites to which it may provide links to. SLCo recommends that visitors to non County sites check the privacy statements of these sites and be cautious about providing personally identifiable information without a clear understanding of how the information will be used. Visitors may also wish to consult privacy guidelines such as those recommended by the [Online Privacy Alliance](http://www.privacyalliance.org/resources/ppguidelines.shtml).
