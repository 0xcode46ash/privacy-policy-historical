**Information Collection and Use  
**Swapalease Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Swapalease Inc. collects information from our users at several different points on our website.   
  
**Registration  
**_General Perspective:_  
It is not necessary for a user to register in order to browse the Swapalease Inc. Web Site; however, it is recommended so that the staff at Swapalease Inc. can keep users posted of new listings and special events. It will also allow personalization of the web site when the user returns in the future.

_Lease "Seller's" Perspective:_  
In order to list a leased vehicle on this website, a user must first complete the required listing sections. During registration a user is required to provide sensitive information (such as social security number and credit card number including expiration date), in addition to contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic information (such as zip code). This information is principally used for verification of lease account information from a particular leasing company and the collection of any listing fee due Swapalease Inc.. Secondarily, this data is used for contacting the user as well as making the sight more personalized for a particular user.

_Lease "Buyer's" Perspective:_  
We request information from the user on our credit statement form. Here a user must provide sensitive information (such as social security number and credit card number including expiration date), in addition to contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic information (such as income and age level). This information is primarily used for credit assessment purposes and collection of processing fees specifically pertaining to the lease transfer process. Secondarily, this data is used for contacting the user as well as making the sight more personalized for a particular user.

Regardless, of your perspective when using the Swapalease Inc. web site you have probably noticed that blue question marks exist on many of the data entry pages. These icons linked with help pages are provided to explain why certain sensitive information is requested and necessary to complete Swapalease, Inc. transactions.   
  
**Cookies  
**A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Swapalease uses cookies to enhance the users experience on the site and to track user behavior while visiting the site.

If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.   
  
**Log Files  
**We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. We do collect log files pertaining to domain names, access times, pages visited, and browser type. These files are not linked to personally identifiable information and are only used for the sole purpose of site management.  
  
**Sharing  
**We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for services. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.   
  
**Links  
**This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Swapalease Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.   
  
**Surveys & Contests  
**From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.   
  
**Security  
**This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry \- SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link [www.verisign.com](http://www.verisign.com/).

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must reenter their password to regain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [security@swapalease.com](mailto:security@swapalease.com).   
  
**Supplementation of Information  
**In order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it may be necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.

For example, to determine if our customers qualify (meet generally accepted leasing company credit standards) for lease transfers it may be necessary for us to use their name and social security number to request a credit report. Once we determine a user's creditworthiness, this document is handled in a matter consistent with Fair Credit Reporting Act guidelines.  
  
**Special Offers  
**We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, and special deals. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.   
  
**Site and Service Updates  
**We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.   
  
**Correction/Updating Personal Information  
**If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. One way this can be accomplished is at the "Managing Your Account" page after member log in. Other avenues include emailing, phoning, or standard mailing our customer support site (see "Contact Us" page for detailed information).   
  
**Choice/Opt-out  
**Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. Users who no longer wish to receive our memorandums or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at [support@swapalease.com](mailto:support@swapalease.com).

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.  
  
**Notification of Changes  
**If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.   
  
**Legal Disclaimer
