For example, we may collect your user ID or profile information that you have permitted to be displayed through SwarmJam in order to display you as a friend or in association with your profile and collections. We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you. We may also collect information about you and your friends who use SwarmJam, from any social network you may have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience. 
  * Payments: When you purchase the items offered on SwarmJam, you will need to submit your credit card or other payment information so that our service providers can process your payment for those products and services.

## Use and Disclosure of Information

SwarmJam generally does not sell, trade, rent, or share the Personal Information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so or otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy. If you do not want us to use or disclose Personal Information collected about you in the manners identified in this Privacy Policy, you may not use SwarmJam.

We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that would otherwise make the Anonymous Information personally identifiable to you. Generally, we aggregate this information and use it in statistical analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of SwarmJam. This Privacy Policy does not limit our use or disclosure of any Anonymous Information in any way, and we reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties in our discretion.

Consistent with our intent to protect your privacy, the personal information you submit to us is used to provide you access to SwarmJam, to improve SwarmJam, customize your experience, and to offer you additional information, opportunities, promotions and functionality from us, our partners or our advertisers at your request.

We may provide your Personal Information to third-party service providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the services and features of SwarmJam and to help us communicate with you. These services may include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments (including credit card payments), and providing customer service. We require our third-party service providers to promise not to use such information except as necessary to provide the relevant services to us. We may share some or all of your Personal Information with our third-party partners, those with whom we have a co-branding or promotional relationship, or other third-parties about whom you are otherwise notified and do not request to opt out of such sharing.

As part of the business transition we may share some or all of your Personal Information with these companies, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of ours or that acquirer's assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect and defend our rights or property, you, or third parties. You hereby consent to us sharing your Personal Information under the circumstances described herein.

## Security

We are committed to protecting the security of your Personal Information. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. You can access your Personally Identifiable Information on our Website through a password and your email address. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. Information submitted through the shopping and registration processes are encrypted through a Secured Socket Layer (SSL) connection, which protects the information in transit.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.
