**Storage and security of your personal data  
** The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a location in Switzerland (server location) or another location outside Australia. The privacy laws of those countries may not provide the same level of protection as the privacy laws of Australia. However, this does not change our commitments to safeguard your privacy and we will comply with all applicable laws relating to the cross-border data disclosure.

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of this website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to this website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to protect the information from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
