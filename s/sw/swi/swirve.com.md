Billah, without you, I would never have gotten through these tough times. I am glad to have a friend I can count on like you. Thank you for being there when I needed you the most.

I just moved to a new city and I had no friends and basically no family, but when I met Tiffany, my life had meaning again, and I just want to say that I love you Tiffancy, and thank you for giving me a chance.
