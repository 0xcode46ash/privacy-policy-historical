# SWIFT - Home - Legal notices - SWIFT data privacy

Protecting your privacy is very important to SWIFT. To do so, we follow general principles in accordance with worldwide best practices on data protection. Information we collect may include personal data related to individuals such as name, address and e-mail address. We treat all this information as confidential. We do not give it or sell it to any third party, except as required by law or as necessary for us to provide you with the required services. We hope the following policy will help you understand how SWIFT collects, uses, and safeguards your information on our web site.

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to add, modify, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check it periodically for changes. 

## Browsing 

If you browse the SWIFT web site, you do so anonymously. We may use your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to administer our web site and to collect and distribute aggregate statistics about our visitors such as traffic patterns and related site information, time spent on a page for internal use only. 

## Collecting and using your information

### Identification data 

When you **voluntarily** supply us with your personal information such as your name, home or business address and e-mail address or other contact information, we will currently use it to correspond with you. In the future, we may also use it to start a subscription upon your request, to register you for a particular service or event, or to prepare your purchase orders. 

### Recruitment data 

Our site also provides a capability for potential candidates to submit their CVs via e-mail. Any CV received by us will be held confidential and used only for the purpose of considering employment or internship as requested. With the exception of recruitment counsels, such information is not shared with third parties unless specifically requested or authorised by the submitting party. 

### Sharing your data 

Because SWIFT operates globally, we may transfer data you submitted to us within our organisation, including to our subsidiaries (local SWIFT offices), our sub-contractors or business partners strictly in order to fulfil your request(s). These entities are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are restricted from using it for any purpose other than helping us to provide you with services. We will not share or sell the information to any outside parties, without your consent. 

## Use of cookies 

Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies only when you access the BIC Database Plus. We do so in order to track your user session. We do not store any confidential or personal information.

## Information protection 

We are fully committed to data security. To prevent unauthorised access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate usage of the information by authorised users, we have put in place physical, electronic and organisational procedures to safeguard and secure the information you provided to us online. However, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information during transmission through the Internet. In this regard, we advise you to take every precaution to protect your personal data while you are using the Internet. 

## Retention 

Currently, we only retain information about you required to reply to your emails. 

## Link to other sites 

This website may contain links to other websites that are not controlled or maintained by SWIFT. Please note that SWIFT is not responsible for the content of these sites. SWIFT is providing outside links for your convenience only, and the inclusion of such links does not imply any endorsement of these sites.
