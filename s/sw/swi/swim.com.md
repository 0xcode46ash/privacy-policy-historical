# Privacy Policy | Swim.com

By using or accessing www.swim.com (the “Site”), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. 

## Effective Date

This policy is effective as of May 21, 2009..

## The Information We Collect

When you visit the Site, you provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose, and information that we collect automatically as you interact with our Site. 

We will ask you to submit personal information when you set up an account, make a purchase, locate a swim instructor, or use other Site services. This information may include your name, date of birth, email address, telephone number, address, gender, schools attended, and (for purchases) your credit card number. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.

When you enter the Site, we automatically collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all Site visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored your computer to enable our systems to recognize your computer and to provide certain features to you. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Website of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

When you use the Site, you may set up a personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide the Site and offer personalized features

The Site may also collect information about you from other sources, such as blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of the Site in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience. 

As more fully stated in the Terms of Use, you submit content to the Site at your own risk. Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that the content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your content. 

Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on the Site is a violation of our Terms of Use and should be reported via our [Contact Form](https://web.archive.org/contact).

## Use of Information Obtained by Us

All of the information we collect, both what you tell us and what we collect automatically, is used for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, tell you about products or services that may be of interest to you, contact you, and conduct research. You can “opt out” of receiving emails or other communications from us about our products or services at your account editing page. 

## Sharing Your Information with Third Parties

We sometimes release user information on an aggregated basis (meaning that the information from many Swim.com users is grouped together in a way that does not disclose the personal information of any particular user).

If you choose to create a profile or submit information to the Site for inclusion on the Site, this information will of course be available to users of the Site. And if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business, or individual business units owned by Swim.com, were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so that the Site may continue operating. 

Furthermore, in certain situations described below, we will provide your personally identifying information to third parties: 

  * We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. For example, we may use third parties to host the Site, to send out email updates about the Site, to send you our targeted advertising, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, or to fulfill orders. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use in connection with these business activities. 
  * We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, or to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Site or using our name. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, or government agencies. 
  * We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies and individuals using the Site. You may also use the Site to help you connect with swim instructors, educational institutions, swim camps, and other third parties. (Collectively, these companies, swim instructors, educational institutions, swim camps, and other third parties may be referred to as the “Third-Party Providers.”) You understand and agree that if you use the Site to purchase a product or service from a Third-Party Provider or to connect with a Third-Party, we may share your information with the applicable Third-Party Provider to facilitate your transaction. 



Please note that because the third parties described above operate independently from Swim.com, Swim.com bears no responsibility for the activities of any of these third parties with regard to their privacy and security policies.

By using or accessing the Site, you consent to the disclosures described above. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this privacy policy, it is Swim.com's policy not to distribute to third parties any personally identifying information about you without your consent (usually communicated through either an “opt-out” or “opt-in” notification or mechanism). 

## General Privacy Information.

Swim.com may make various public forums (such as message boards, chat rooms or news groups) available to its users. When you disclose personal information in such public forums, that information can be collected and used by others in various ways, such as sending unsolicited messages. You are solely responsible for any postings you make on public forums on Swim.com, and for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. Further, the Swim.com web site may contain links to partners, advertisers and third party Internet sites and services that may collect data. Swim.com may also be linked to by, and in some cases framed by, certain partner web sites. Each of the web sites (linked from Swim.com, or linking to Swim.com) will have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of Swim.com, and Swim.com has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Site. 

## Changing or Removing Information

You can access and modify most of your personal information at any time by accessing your account. Also, upon your request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally remove you and your personal information from the Site. Removed information may persist in backup or archived copies but will not be generally available to the users of the Site or other third parties.

## Security

Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or your password), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Nevertheless, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of your information.

Your use of the Site, and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use and all of its dispute resolution provisions, including limitation on damages and choice of law. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time. If we make changes, we will post them and will indicate at the top of this page the policy's new effective date.
