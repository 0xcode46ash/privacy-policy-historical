##  How we use your information and who we share it with

Your privacy is important to us and we promise we will respect your personal information. We will use your information to manage your insurance with us, including underwriting, claims handling, No Claims Discount entitlement and statistical analysis. This may include disclosing your information within the [AXA Group](https://web.archive.org/about/axa/) and to agents, suppliers, other insurers, or reinsurers who provide services on our behalf.

  
We do not disclose your information to anyone outside the AXA Group except: 

  * Where we have your permission; or
  * Where we are required or permitted to do so by law; or
  * To other companies who provide a service to us or you which includes proof of No Claims Discount (NCD) entitlement; or
  * Where we may transfer rights and obligations under this agreement.



We may transfer your information to other countries including those located outside the European Economic Area. If we do this we will seek to ensure that anyone to whom we pass it provides an adequate level of protection.

##  Using your online account

When you setup your first policy with Swiftcover, you need to set up an online account (My Swift Space). In My Swift Space, you can:

  * View and print all your policy information and documents
  * Securely make changes to your policy yourself whenever you want



To set up and use My Swift Space, you'll need:

  * Your email address, which you give us when you buy your policy 
  * A memorable password which you can choose
  * To answer an additional security question when you first set up your account



By using the same email address when buying additional Swiftcover policies, your new documents will be stored to your existing online account. You can then view all your details in the same Swift Space. If you prefer you new policy to be saved in a different online account, you will need to use a different email address. 

We recommend that you do not share your account details with anyone. If you do give your email address and password to another person, they will have all your privileges, and will be able to view or change your cover or details. In these instances you will be responsible for their actions, and Swiftcover cannot accept any responsibility for any adjustment made without your authority. 

Because circumstances can change, you should review your access details regularly to make sure they are still appropriate for you and anyone you have given permission to access your account. 

To setup up a separate account for one or more of your existing policies, please contact our [help team](https://web.archive.org/contact/).

If we’re contacted by phone we won’t discuss the policy with anybody other than the policyholder unless we already have their explicit consent. See Dealing with other people below.

##  Fraud prevention agencies

To keep premiums low we do participate in a number of industry initiatives to prevent and detect fraud. To help prevent crime we may at any time: 

  * Approach the DVLA to check all or any relevant driving licence details of anyone named on the policy;
  * Share information about you with other organisations and public bodies including the police;
  * Share information about you and any other named drivers on the policy within the AXA Group and with other insurers;
  * Pass the details you have supplied to recognised centralised insurance industry applications, policy and claims checking systems (for example the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, CUE, CIFAS and all DVLA databases) where those details will be checked and updated.
  * Check the details you have supplied with fraud prevention agencies and databases including publicly available data (for example on County Court Judgements, bankruptcy information and electoral role data). If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies to prevent fraud and money laundering;
  * Periodically search records held by fraud prevention and credit reference agencies to: 
    * help make decisions about credit services for you and your Financial Associates
    * help make decisions on insurance policies and claims for you and your Financial Associates;
    * trace debtors, recover debt, prevent fraud and to manage your insurance policies

##  Motor Insurance Database

When you take out a car insurance policy, your policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database ("MID"), run by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre ("MIIC"). MID data may be used by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Northern Ireland for the purpose of electronic vehicle licensing and by the police for the purposes of establishing whether a driver's use of a vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and for preventing and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident, whether in the UK or abroad, other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers' Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to obtain relevant policy information.

Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other EU countries) may be entitled to access relevant information held about you on the MID. You can find out more about this from us, or from the [Motor Insurance Bureau](http://www.miic.org.uk/).

##  Dealing with other people

Data protection rules mean that we are only allowed to talk to the policyholder about anything to do with their insurance – unless they have named an alternative contact (such as a relative) to speak with us on their behalf. 

How to name an alternative contact
     If you took out or renewed your insurance after 24 June 2014, you can [ log in to your online account](https://secure.swiftcover.com/privatedomain/) and add an alternative contact to your policy yourself. If your policy was set up before then, please [contact our help team](https://web.archive.org/contact/call-us/) to name an alternative contact.

Once you have told us your alternative contact, this person will be able to discuss all aspects of your policy (including claims) with us and make changes on your behalf except to cancel your policy or decline a renewal.

In some exceptional circumstances we may also deal with other people who contact us on behalf of the policyholder.

We will not reveal any credit or debit card numbers to anyone other than the policyholder.
