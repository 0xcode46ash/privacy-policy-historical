**Customer Information**

Swiftpage collects and stores information about its customers including, but not limited to: email address, survey results, phone number, credit card number, and billing address. This information is for the sole use of Swiftpage and used for billing accounts, new product and service notification, and customer support. Swiftpage does not sell email lists, survey results, or any other customer information and is committed to keeping your information confidential.  If you receive email through the Swiftpage system and wish to opt-out, simply click the “Leave this list” link in the footer of the email.  To be completely removed from the list that you are a part of, please contact the sender of the email by replying to that email (Swiftpage is not the list origin).  If you receive an email directly from Swiftpage (i.e. you are a current or past customer) and wish to have your name removed from our list, please reply to us at [support@swiftpage.com](mailto:support@swiftpage.com) with your request and we will be happy to honor it.

Personally identifiable information can be disclosed to government agencies subject to warrants, subpoenas, and other governmental orders.  
In addition, personally identifiable information submitted by you in public forums on this site and via email campaign (view as a web page link) will be visible and displayed publicly.

Swiftpage does not intentionally collect information from anyone under the age of 13.

In the case of a merger or bankruptcy, Swiftpage would not sell customer information to 3rd parties.  The data would either become a part of the merger (keeping privacy in tact) or would destroy the information.

Swiftpage keeps customer information for at least the duration that the account is active (paying).  Currently, Swiftpage archives all data which is then stored in a secure location.

**Commitment to Safe Harbor**

In accordance with our commitment to protect personal privacy, Swiftpage adheres to the principles of the Safe Harbor Framework as developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission. The seven principles and fifteen Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) referred to in this policy constitute the Safe Harbor privacy framework. These principles and FAQs may be found at: <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>

**Software**

Swiftpage does not install cookies, or any other software on your computer.  When an email is sent to a recipient through the Swiftpage service, open and click information is gathered and reported back to the Swiftpage account owner for the purposes of tracking delivery and interest level.  The Swiftpage website uses analytics software to monitor traffic, but not personally identifiable information.

**Dispute Resolution**

If a situation arises where you have a privacy dispute, please contact Swiftpage directly and we will be happy to work with you in a fair and practical manner (see Swiftpage contact information at the top of this page).  If after speaking with Swiftpage, you feel that you have not come to a mutually agreeable resolution, we will use eTrust as an arbitrator.

**Payment**

Swiftpage does not store credit card information submitted through our online payment system.  Swiftpage uses established payment gateways (Sage Payment Solutions and Chase Paymentech) to process credit cards to ensure PCI compliance and security.

**User Profile**

Swiftpage customers set up a user profile within their account for the purpose of identifying them as the sender of email within the footer of the email.  This is done to ensure compliance with the U.S. CAN-SPAM law.  User profiles can be updated at any time by logging in to your account and clicking the User Profile button on the My Swiftpage page.

**Security**

Swiftpage is dedicated to keeping your information secure. Each customer account is password-protected to ensure that only you have access to your information. Swiftpage will never contact you with unsolicited phone calls or emails asking for your password so do not divulge your contact information to anyone contacting you in this manner. While we do everything in our power to ensure your information is secure, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% safe from those wishing to unlawfully obtain it.
