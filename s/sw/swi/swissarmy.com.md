# Victorinox Swiss Army

Last updated June 28, 2011

Victorinox Swiss Army (“Victorinox”, “We” or “Us”) respects the privacy concerns of our website users and customers and has set forth this Privacy Policy to clearly explain to you how we collect and use your information.  This Privacy Policy is only applicable for communications to the United States and the Caribbean for the website located at [www.swissarmy.com](http://www.swissarmy.com/) and victorinox.com (the "Website").  Though our trademark might appear on other websites, such other websites have their own policies and are not subject to this policy.

**Personally Identifiable Information that we collect**

We do not collect personally identifiable information from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us, such as by registering on the Website for an ID, purchasing a product or otherwise choosing to share your personally identifiable information with us. The personally identifiable information which you may provide to us could include your name, email address, physical address, birth month, credit card number and other personal information.

**Non-personal or Aggregate Information that we collect**

When you access our Website, we may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information from you, such as IP host address, web pages viewed, browser type, referring website, usage and browsing habits on the Website and similar data.  We may also aggregate demographic information collected from our users (such as the number of users in a particular State) in a manner which does not identify any one individual.

**Cookies**

We may also collect non-personal information through the use of cookies and similar tracking methods. Cookies are tools used to retrieve information during your online session, such as keeping track of the items placed in your shopping cart.  Such cookies may store personally identifiable information on your local computer to make it easier for you to use our Website.  For your added security, our cookies terminate at the end of your browser session.  We may use these cookies for location and language preferences and will store them indefinitely.  Many web browsers are designed to accept cookies, but you may prefer to modify your browser to prevent acceptance. It is possible, however, that some areas of this website will not function properly if you do so.  You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or flush them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences, in which case you may still use our Website, but it may interfere with some of its functionality. Cookies and similar items are not used by us to automatically retrieve personally identifiable information from your computer without your knowledge. 

**Tracking Links Clicked**

In order to create a better electronic community, we may keep track of patterns of use in the emails we send out. We note which links are clicked in our email communications as specific user profile information to tell us what areas are of most interest to our opt-in email recipients. We may use this information to better personalize the content and promotions that visitors and mail recipients will see in our mailings.

**Information Usage**

We will only use your personally identifiable information as described below, unless you have specifically consented to another type of use, either at the time the personally identifiable information is collected from you or through some other form of consent from you or notification to you:

  * We may use your personally identifiable information to respond to your inquires or requests.
  * Your personally identifiable information will be used and shared to process your purchases, such as by credit card processors and shipping companies.
  * We may use your personally identifiable information to send you emails from time to time about our products if you have opt-ed into our mailing lists, but we will not provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for them to contact you directly unless otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy or you provide your consent.
  * If you purchase a product from a third party on our Website, then that third party will receive your personally identifiable information and will use it according to its own policies.  Therefore, you should be aware of this fact when browsing and purchasing products from parties other than Victorinox.
  * We may permit our vendors and subcontractors to access your personally identifiable information, but they are only permitted to do so in connection with performing services for us.  They are not authorized by us to use the information for their own benefit.
  * We may disclose personally identifiable information as required by law or legal process.
  * We may disclose personally identifiable information to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, or the terms or policies for our Website. 
  * We may transfer your personally identifiable information in connection with the sale or merger or change of control of Victorinox or the division responsible for the services with which your personally identifiable information is associated.
  * We may share your personally identifiable information with an affiliate of Victorinox who is in the same corporate family as us as long as their privacy practices are substantially similar to ours.



Non- personally identifiable or aggregate information may be shared with any number of parties, provided that such information shall not specifically identify you.

**Security**

The security of your personally identifiable information is very important to us. When we collect your personally identifiable information offline, we use reasonable efforts to protect it from unauthorized access.  Victorinox uses a safe and secure online ordering system. We use industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology for online purchases. This secure server software encrypts all of your personally identifiable information during a purchase, including credit card number, address, first and last name, so that it cannot be easily read in transfer.  However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that your personally identifiable information will be completely free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use of our Website demonstrates your assumption of this risk. 

We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 18.  When we become aware that personal information from a child under 18 has been collected without such child’s parent or guardian’s consent, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this Privacy Policy at any time.  However, if at any time in the future we plan to use personally identifiable information in a way that materially differs from this Privacy Policy, including sharing such information with more third parties, we will post such changes here and provide you the opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses.  Your continued use of the Website following the posting of any changes to this Privacy Policy means you accept such changes. 

**Data retention**

We retain your information for as long as we reasonably believe that there is a commercial reason for doing so.

**Opt-Out Process**

All unsubscribe or opt-out requests should be sent to us at [unsubscribe@swsissarmy.com](mailto:unsubscribe@swsissarmy.com) and we will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt.  However, we are not responsible for removing your personally identifiable information from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy or your consent, such as a third party company selling products to you through the Website.  You should contact such third parties directly.

**Communications with Victorinox**

By providing your email address to us, you expressly consent to receive emails from us.  We may use email to communicate with you, to send information that you have requested or to send information about other products or services developed or provided by us or our business partners, provided that, we will not give your email address to another party to promote their products or services directly to you without your consent or as set forth in this policy.

**Terms of Use**

Use of this Website is governed by, and subject to, the [ Terms of Use ](https://web.archive.org/web/20120507233122id_/http%3A//www.swissarmy.com/us/content/footer_slot_terms_and_safetyPage)  ** **

**United States of America**

Our servers are maintained in the United States of America.  By using the Website or making a purchase, you freely and specifically give us your consent to export your personally identifiable information to the USA and to store and use it in the USA as specified in this Privacy Policy.
