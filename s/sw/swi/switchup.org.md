# Switch | Privacy Policy, Bootcamp Reviews

This Agreement was last modified on August 5, 2014. DebunkMe Inc., dba "Switch", ("us", "we", or "our") operates switchup.org (the "Site"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information we receive from users of the Site. 

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Switch collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Switch’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Switch’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Switch may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Switch also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Switch only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Switch’s websites choose to interact with Switch in ways that require Switch to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Switch gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at WordPress.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Switch – by purchasing access to the Akismet comment spam prevention service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Switch collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Switch. Switch does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

Switch may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Switch may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Switch does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Switch discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Switch’s behalf or to provide services available at Switch’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Switch’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Switch will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Switch discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Switch believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Switch, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Switch website and have supplied your email address, Switch may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Switch and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Switch takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. We are working to compile a list of all affiliate organizations so that our partners are fully disclosed.

## Business Transfers

If Switch, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Switch goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Switch may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Switch may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Switch’s sole discretion. Switch encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. We will track a history of changes to the privacy policy and make this history publicly available.
