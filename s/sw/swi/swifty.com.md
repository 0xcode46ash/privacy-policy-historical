# Swifty.com | Privacy Policy

At Swifty, we believe in easily presenting the kinds of information that our users are interested in. To do this, we collect certain information when you visit Swifty to better serve our users. This page will inform you about the information that is collected and how you can control what information is being collected and the way it is being used. If you cannot agree to the terms that are listed in this policy, please do not use Swifty.

**Information We Collect**

Swifty collects two types of information: information that you voluntarily provide to us that can be personally identifiable and information that we automatically collect that is not personally identifiable. We log the information you submit to us through users submissions and the statistical information we gather when you visit Swifty.

Users submissions are anything a user voluntarily posts on the site, such as feedback, comments, questions, and answers to Swifty. Users submissions may appear on Swifty and logged for our records, but will never include personal information unless it is provided within the submission itself. If you do not wish your personal information to become public knowledge, please do not include it with your submission.

When you browse Swifty, we automatically collect your browser type, IP address, pages viewed, searches you make and timestamp information. This information is statistical in nature and will never include a user’s personal information. It is only collected to create a more user-friendly experience.

Swifty, like most websites, requires the use of cookies. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your hard drive and sent from a user’s browser. They are used to improve the user experience by storing site preferences. It will always be a user’s choice to enable or disable cookies, but enabling them provides a more full experience of Swifty. You can disable cookies on your browser settings if you choose to do so.

**Third Parties**

Swifty will do everything in our power to protect your information. We will never, under any circumstances, sell, lease, rent or trade your information to outside parties.

While we may display advertisements from third parties on our site, we are in no way affiliated with those third parties and are not responsible for the privacy protection on those sites. Once you redirect from Swifty, we are no longer liable for your privacy.

Swifty may transfer non-personally identifiable information to our current or future affiliates. These affiliates include: our parent company, joint ventures, subsidiaries or companies under common or future common control. These companies are required to abide by our privacy policy, so you will be protected just the same on those sites.

Your personal information will only be shared to other persons if required to do so by means of the law. This includes subpoenas, warrants, court order and in protection of our users and the public.

**Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act**

We proudly follow COPPA. Under COPPA, we will never collect information from users under the age of 13. Swifty is geared to users over that age. If you are someone under the age of 13 and you wish to use Swifty, please ask a parent or guardian for help.

**California Online Privacy Protection Act**

While the protection of your privacy on the Internet is never guaranteed, we do everything we can to protect our users. Because of this, we comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. Your information will never be shared with outside parties unless you give consent.
