SWREG PRIVACY STATEMENT

SWREG provides its vendors with a variety of online sales related services.  Some of these services may be provided through sites bearing our partners and vendors names and trademarks. 

Depending on the nature of the services provided by SWREG to our partners or vendors, SWREG may receive personal information either from you directly or from our partner or vendor who provides us with the personal information to fulfill a service to you on their behalf.  In some circumstances personal information that SWREG receives from you directly may be provided to our partners or vendors in order for them to fulfill a service to us for your benefit or directly to you.  The personal information may include but is not limited to your name, mailing address, phone number, type of hardware or software you own and other information required to provide you with the product, service or support requested. 

SWREG also employs other companies to provide services to it in connection with your transaction.  We may use companies to process credit card payments, deliver packages, send mail, analyze data, provide marketing aid and assistance, provide customer service, and otherwise provide services to us to enable us to serve you and enhance our services.  These organizations may have access to personal information as required to permit them to perform their obligations to us.  We require these organizations to undertake to protect personal information and to only use it in accordance with applicable laws and for the purposes for which they are specifically engaged. 

We may also provide links from our Website to third party websites who may provide services to you directly or on our behalf.  THE PRIVACY POLICIES OF THESE THIRD PARTY SITES MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM OUR PRIVACY POLICIES AND WILL GOVERN ANY TRANSACTIONS UNDERTAKEN ON THAT SITE.  We urge you to review the privacy policy of any site to which you are linked. 

The information we receive may be transferred outside the European Union for processing.  We will undertake to obligate any person or entity receiving such information to process any such information in accordance with this Privacy Statement and in accordance with applicable law.  By submitting your order either to our partner or to us you consent to the use of your personal information as set forth above and the transfer of that data as outlined in this paragraph to our partners or those individuals or entities we engage to provide services in connection with your transaction. 

SWREG also reserves the right to report to such entities any activities that we believe to be unlawful.  Any report made to under this paragraph will be made without prior notice to you. 

In the event SWREG merges with another entity, is acquired by another entity, or enters into a business combination with another entity, SWREG may be required to disclose and some or all of your personally identifiable information to that entity to continue serving you. 

Customers who buy through the SWREG system are shopping on a secure server which encrypts all of a customer’s personal information.  This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for a third party to access or use your personal information in an unauthorized manner. 

SWREG has developed its service with security as a top priority.  We use firewalls to prevent access to information in our system and Secure Socket Layers (“SSL”) to encrypt your personal information and protect it from disclosure, destruction, modification or use. 

“Cookies” are a data analysis technique that uses information stored on your browser.  SWREG’s cookies are used to identify a customer, not to identify specific customer traits.  If you do not want cookies in your browser, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website attempts to place a cookie in your browser. 

We may also collect other information which does not in and of itself identify a specific individual.  This information includes IP addresses, search terms, domain names and browser types.  We use this information to track usage and other patterns on our Websites. 

SWREG does not sell, trade or rent personal information to anyone.  We will not use or share your personally identifiable information with others except those individuals or entities which we have engaged to provide services to you,  for those purposes set forth above or with your consent. 

SWREG will not share or use your personal information in ways unrelated to the purpose for which you provided us the information, without providing you the opportunity to consent to such unrelated uses.  At the time you provide your information, we will offer you a choice as to whether or not you wish to receive further communications about special offers, product information or other marketing messages.  We may provide this information to our business partners and vendors.  If you choose not to receive these communications, we will not use your personally identifiable information for this purpose. 

SWREG will provide you with the ability to access your personal information maintained on our system and permit you to review and correct that personal information or change your choices or preferences with regard to that personal information; for instance, whether or not you wish to be contacted about specials or new products.  We reserve the right to protect our own or other’s confidential or personal information in connection with your review and correction and further reserve the right to charge you a reasonable fee for access to your personal information dependent on the nature and scope of your request and the difficulty in complying with your request.   


SWREG may amend this Policy from time-to-time.  We suggest you visit this Website periodically to determine whether or not any such changes have been made.
