**This Privacy Policy was last updated on 18 May 2016**  


SweatCo Ltd is a company incorporated in England & Wales (registration number 09242159) whose registered office is at c/o OHS Secretaries Limited, 9th Floor, 107 Cheapside, London, EC2V 6DN  (hereafter referred to as “ **SweatCo”** ,  **“we”**  or  **“us”**  as the context may require).  SweatCo is committed to protecting your privacy in full compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws. 

 This Privacy Policy, together with our Terms of Use (<http://sweatco.in/uk/tnc>), applies to your use of the Sweatcoin mobile application (the “ **Sweatcoin App”** ), any website operated by SweatCo (including <http://sweatco.in/>) (the  **“SweatCo Website(s)”** ) and any services we provide that are accessible via any of them.  This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.  

By visiting any SweatCo Website(s) or by downloading, installing or using the Sweatcoin App, you accept this Privacy Policy and consent to the processing of your personal data as described herein.

In this Privacy Policy, the terms “data controller”, “personal data” and “process” shall have the meanings given in the Data Protection Act 1998 applicable in England and Wales (the  **“Act”** ). SweatCo is the data controller in respect of personal data processed under this Privacy Policy (our details are provided above.) 

 **INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU  
**  


We may collect and process the following data about you:

 **Information you give us** : You may provide us with information about you in connection with your use of the Sweatcoin App or SweatCo Website(s), for example by filling in forms or using functionality on such Sweatcoin App or SweatCo Website(s) or by corresponding with us by email or otherwise contacting us.

Such information may include the following: 

·       the information you provide when you register to use the Sweatcoin App, which requires the submission by you to us of your name, mobile phone number, email address as well as usernames, passwords and the identification credentials that are used to authenticate you, enable you to use the Sweatcoin App and enable us to communicate with you.  

·       During the account registration process we may provide functionality allowing you to search for friends by using your Facebook credentials and where you elect to do this you will be asked to allow the Sweatcoin App to access certain information associated with your Facebook account such as your name, profile picture, gender, list of friends and other public information.  Provided you consent to this, such information will be processed by us in order to identify your Facebook friends that are users of Sweatcoin App and to allow you to invite your Facebook friends to install the Sweatcoin App. ** _ _**

·       any data you upload to the Sweatcoin App in relation to your user profile or in connection with any listing on the Sweatcoin Marketplace (as defined in our Terms of Use). This may include biographical information, contact details and any photographs that you upload. 

·       any data you submit to us when you correspond with us or contact us in any manner. The information you provide to us will depend upon the circumstances, but may include your name, address, e-mail address and phone number and technical details of the device that you use to operate the Sweatcoin App.  

·       other information you provide to us in connection with your use of the Sweatcoin App and SweatCo Website(s), such as your consents, preferences and feedback, and technical and bug fixing information.

 **Information we collect about you and your devices:  **When you register as a user of the Sweatcoin App, use the Sweatcoin App or visit the SweatCo Website(s) we may collect the following information:

·       industry-standard log data about the device type, browser and operating system you are using and your IP address at the time of the creation of your user account. We may also collect the IP address associated with your device running the Sweatcoin App each time the Sweatcoin App syncs with our systems. 

·       technical information, including the type of mobile device you use, software version, details of your browser, unique device identifiers, mobile network information, your mobile operating system, and your time zone setting; 

·       information stored on your device, including contact lists (where you grant the Sweatcoin App access to such information);

·       analytics information relating to your use of the Sweatcoin App and/or SweatCo Website(s), including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, and the resources that you access. 

 **Information about your location and movement:  ** In order for the Sweatcoin App to function properly it needs to monitor and verify the forms of eligible movement undertaken by users of the Sweatcoin App.  

When you opt in to allow the Sweatcoin App to track your step-count and GPS/Cell-ID location data using your phone’s in-built sensors, SweatCo will automatically collect information related to your movement and location. This information is stored against your individual user account. SweatCo will use this information to accurately attribute eligible movement and Sweatcoins to your account. 

You can turn location monitoring on and off using the settings of your operating system of your mobile device. Where you disable this functionality we will not be able to collect information relating to your step-count and GPS/Cell-ID location.  This would prevent the tracking and conversion of your movement into Sweatcoins.

 The Sweatcoin App starts collecting location and movement related data as soon as you have created your Sweatcoin account, installed the Sweatcoin App to your mobile device and enabled the Sweatcoin App to access the relevant data. The data collection will continue until you disable, using your mobile device’s operating system, the Sweatcoin App’s access to the GPS and activity data generated by your mobile device, or uninstall the Sweatcoin App.

 **Information we receive from other sources:**  We may work with third parties from time to time (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies) and may receive information about you from them. This may include your purchase history from business partners who supply you with rewards made available on the Sweatcoin App.

 **COOKIES AND ANALYTICS  
**  


We use cookies to distinguish you from other users of the Sweatcoin App and SweatCo Website(s) and obtain certain information about your usage and behaviour. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we put on your computer when you use the Sweatcoin App or SweatCo Website(s). This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you use the Sweatcoin App or browse the SweatCo Website(s) and also allows us to improve the Sweatcoin App and SweatCo Website(s). We will use both persistent cookies, which could remain on your device until their expiration (which, in some cases, is up to 10 years), and session cookies, which are temporary files removed from your device once your browser is closed.

The types of cookies we may use include: 

·        **Analytical/Tracking Cookies:**  These allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors to and to see how visitors use the SweatCo Website(s) and how users operate the Sweatcoin App, as well as to verify transactions initiated on the Sweatcoin App and completed on the SweatCo Website(s). This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. 

·        **Advertising and Retargeting Cookies:  **These allow us to generate appropriate advertising directed to you on the SweatCo Website(s) as well as on the Sweatcoin App and other third party websites.

Please note that third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.  You may block cookies used by websites by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies you may not be able to use all functionality of the SweatCo Website(s). 

We use a number of industry-standard data analytics tools, such as Google Analytics and Facebook Analytics. These collect certain information about you, such as your device’s IP address and browsing and usage behaviour, and are used to allow us to track and monitor the traffic visiting the Sweatcoin App and SweatCo Website(s).
