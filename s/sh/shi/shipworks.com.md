This Privacy Policy of Interapptive, Inc. d/b/a ShipWorks (“ShipWorks”) describes in greater detail the privacy practices of ShipWorks and its corporate affiliates, meaning companies related by common ownership or control (“us,” “we,” “our”) responsible for collecting and maintaining certain information collected about you.

If you have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, please contact us as detailed under the How to Contact Us heading below.

  1. **WHEN THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES. If a Service you’re using links to this Privacy Policy, this Policy applies to you.**

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to our sites, products, and services (collectively, “Services”) that link to this Policy. ShipWorks is the controller of all Personal Information subject to this Policy for our Services.

  2. **WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION. We want to be clear about what information we collect and how we use it to deliver our Services to you, operate our business, and help make our Services useful, and work better for you. We do not sell or share your Personal Information with third parties for their own commercial uses, if you have opted out of such sharing.**

    1. **Types of Information We Collect.** In connection with accessing our Services, we may collect information from you which can be used to identify you (“Personal Information”), such as your name, shipping/billing address, email address, phone, username and password.

We collect information when you register or open an account, sign in, pay a bill, purchase a Service, call us for support, or give us feedback. We may also get information from other companies or third parties, such as when you sync a third party account or service with your ShipWorks Account, or when we may use service providers to supplement the Personal Information you give us (e.g., validate your mailing address) to help us maintain the accuracy of your data and provide you with better service. Finally, we may collect content or other information that you may provide or create when you interact with our Services.

We may also automatically collect certain usage information when you access our Services (“Usage Data”), such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, log files, unique device identifiers, pages viewed, browser type, any links you click on to leave or interact with our Services, and other usage information collected from cookies and other tracking technologies. For example, we collect IP addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information, such as using IP addresses to monitor the regions from which users navigate to our Services. We may also collect IP addresses from users when they log into the Services as part of our log-in and security features. We may also, when you enable location-based Services, collect Global Positioning System (GPS) location data and/or motion data.

Our Services may change over time and we may introduce new features that may collect new or different types of information.

    2. **How We Use Your Information.** We may use your information, including your Personal Information, for the following purposes:

If you set up an administrator account that may be accessed by people other than you, please note that they may see and have the ability to change or delete your Personal Information. Please be careful who you give administrator access to, as you are responsible for their actions.
