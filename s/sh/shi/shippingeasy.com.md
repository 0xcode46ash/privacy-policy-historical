# SHIPPING EASY Privacy Policy

### **Privacy Policy  
**

You may be concerned about the privacy of information that you give us.  That’s fair enough. We have prepared this policy to help you understand how we collect, use and disclose your personal information.  We may update this policy now and then by publishing a new version on the website, so please check back. You are welcome to [_get in touch_](https://www.shippingeasy.com/about/contact_us) if you would like to know more.  We have a Privacy Officer who can assist you.

ShippingEasy must comply with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the National Privacy Principles when we handle your personal information.

Your personal information is information that can be linked to your identity. 

Generally speaking, the kinds of personal information ShippingEasy collects are:

·           your name and contact details like your address, telephone number and email address;  
·           the details of your order like your pick up and drop off addresses; and  
·           sign-on data, page view statistics, website traffic and your personal website preferences.

We do not receive your financial information.  If you enter payment details online, these go directly to a independent secure payment facility. [

Generally we collect your personal information directly from you, for example when you book a delivery or register for further access and services. We may also place "cookies" (small files placed on the hard drive of your computer) and “web beacons” (electronic images placed in the web page code) on your computer when you visit some parts of our website.  Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive when you close your browser.  We may use permanent or session cookies to help analyse web page flow, customise services, content and advertising and promote trust and safety.  You can block our cookies by changing the settings on your browser, but this may prevent your access to ShippingEasy services.  


There may be times when we collect your personal information from other sources including from our [_partners_](https://www.shippingeasy.com/about/partners) , for example when they provide us with a delivery confirmation or a problem with a package.   


To make use of shippingeasy.com as easy as possible! For example, providing your personal information means we are able to easily contact you if there are any problems with deliveries.  This helps us provide the best possible service. 

We are also obliged to collect personal information to meet obligations to our [_partners_](http://www.shippingeasy.com/about/partners) and to comply with laws.  


Don’t worry, we won’t sell, rent or trade personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent. [We may pass on your personal information to our related companies and our [_partners_](http://www.shippingeasy.com/about/partners)   when we are organising your shipping so that all the hassle is taken out of your hands!   


We may use your personal information now and then to give you the option of receiving offers and information from ShippingEasy and our related companies.  That’s unless you tell us that you would prefer not to receive them, of course!  You are not obliged to receive these and can opt out at any time.  Just [_let us know_](https://www.shippingeasy.com/about/contact_us) or, for emails, click on the unsubscribe link in the email.

We may have to disclose your information to third parties that we engage to perform administrative or other services.  This disclosure is always on a confidential basis. If our company or business is bought by someone else, we may share personal information with the buyer, but they must still comply with this policy. We may also disclose your personal information if you give us your consent or if disclosure is required by law. 

You can still use the ShippingEasy website, but you may not be able to access some parts and you won’t be able to book shipping.
