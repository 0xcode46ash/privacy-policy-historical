shine! is committed to protecting your privacy.

shine! is a strong advocate for increased privacy standards and is active in the fight against unsolicited email (spam).

To help personalize your experience with shine!, or to meet legal requirements for charitable donations, some information must be obtained. You have our assurance that:

We are committed to safeguarding your privacy online.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

shine! does not collect personally identifying information about you except when you specifically and knowingly provide it. Types of information we collect include your name and e-mail address, so we can identify you as a unique individual and grant you access to your personal page. We also ask for your zip code, so that we can personalize news, volunteer opportunities and other information based on your geographic location. We collect, but do not require, demographic information such as addresses and income levels so that we can offer future products and services that meet our users' needs. And we ask for, but also do not require, a phone number so that we can personally respond to any technical support and/or customer service issues.

When you join shine!, you will receive an e-mail confirming your membership. You will also receive e-mail messages to confirm charitable donations (and for your tax records), sponsorships and support requests (answers to technical or customer service issues will be done via e-mail or telephone). If you are a nonprofit representative and have joined shine!, you will receive an e-mail confirmation of your membership and ability for your organization to post information on your charity's shine! page.

Users have the option to remain anonymous when making donations to nonprofit organizations, so that the organizations will not receive your name or contact information when they get your donation. When you make a donation, simply click in the box marked "anonymous" to protect your identity.

Upon joining shine!, users are automatically added to the weekly "rise & shine!" e-mail newsletter, which includes information about news stories on shine!, and special events and promotions. Users can "opt-out" of the newsletter program by clicking the "no" button in the newsletter box on the registration form.

We only collect information from you when you knowingly and willingly submit information to us. In addition to the kinds of information and uses referenced above, we also make it possible for members to submit:

•  Resumes  
•  Passwords to access secure, private pages  
•  Date of birth  
•  Social security number  
•  Employee identification number (if participating in an employee giving program)  
•  Nonprofit EIN number  
•  Technical support requests  
•  Home and business addresses and e-mails addresses  
•  Sponsorship and donation amounts

Users can donate to their favorite charities with a credit card (see encryption information below). For the purpose of donations and personal sponsorships (e.g., challenge or matching grants), shine! collects credit card numbers and expiration dates, as well as a billing address. As an added service, shine! can save multiple credit cards on a secure server, so that users can, for example, have a card for making personal donations and a card for making corporate donations. This also streamlines the process so that users don't have to re-enter credit card information each time they make a donation.

Using the secure technology described below, this encrypted information is transferred to the National Philanthropic Trust (NPT). NPT is an independent 501(c)(3) public charity that administers the shine! Charities Trust, a donor-advised fund established by shine! to receive all online charitable donations. When you make a donation through shine!, NPT issues you an electronic receipt, documenting your charitable contribution and ensuring the integrity of the donation process through an independent board of directors.

shine! may provide aggregate statistics about its members, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-parties, but these statistics will not include personally identifying information. By aggregating the information in a non-identifiable fashion and providing it to reputable third-parties, we can increase our ability to provide 100%-to-charity™ donations.
