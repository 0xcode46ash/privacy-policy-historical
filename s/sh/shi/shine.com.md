**Users under the age of 13-years-old:**

We welcome users under the age of 13-years-old and hope that you enjoy the many parts of our site that do not require registration. We do not allow users under the age of 13 to register, in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. 

**Users over the age of 13-years-old:**

**I. When information is and is not collected**

  * When you register with SHiNE, you will be asked for personal information: Full Name, Gender, Date of Birth, Email Address, School and Zip/Postal Code. You will also be asked to provide a Username, which will be used to identify you on the SHiNE message boards and journals, and a Password, so that only you can use your Username. 
  * You may choose to "Get Involved" with SHiNE without registering for the site. You will be asked to provide personal information so that we can contact you. 
  * SHiNE only utilizes information that is voluntarily submitted. SHiNE does not use cookies to track user habits or to gain access to personally identifiable information that you haven't already provided. 
  * SHiNE also provides a "Send to a Friend" feature, which allows you to forward a message to a friend. The email addresses you enter for your friends are used for this one-time only email, and are not stored. Your friends will not be put on any sort of mailing list. 

**II. The type of information we use**

  * We collect date of birth information to ensure that all of our registered users are at least 13 years old, in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. 
  * SHiNE collects Zip/Postal Code to identify what locale you are from in order to understand the geographical distribution of the SHiNE community. 
  * Since SHiNE is a youth-based non-profit organization, we collect School information to identify possible areas for SHiNE activities and clubs. 
  * We collect E-Mail Addresses to contact SHiNE users (e.g. contest winners). 
  * On the registration form, you have the opportunity to opt into SHiNE's email mailing list. SHiNE sends out a weekly newsletter, which you may unsubscribe from at any time by sending an email to [_Maxine@shinemail.org_](mailto:Maxine@shinemail.org) with "Unsubscribe" as the header. 

**III. How we use information**  
When you post a message on the SHiNE Message Boards or Online Journals, only your Username is made available to those who read the posted message. Please consider this when you post. You may reveal your Name, E-mail Address, or other personally identifiable information at your own risk; however, SHiNE does not recommend it. SHiNE does not accept any liability for difficulties that arise from self-disclosure of any personal information. 

We do not sell or market lists of our users or any of our users' personally identifiable information. However, SHiNE may provide aggregate information about our audience to other organizations (e.g. our audience is x% female and x% male.) 

All of the user's database information is processed on the back-end of our site requiring multiple authentication processes to gain access. Employee access to this data is limited to personnel that are responsible for maintaining the database. 

Lastly, SHiNE may choose to disclose account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use or may be causing injury or interference, intentionally or unintentionally, to SHiNE's rights or property, other SHiNE users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. 

**IV. Partners and Sponsors**  
SHiNE works with partners and sponsors in order to provide you with a Web site that continually meets your needs. We may develop custom features for some of our partners and sponsors (e.g. contests). In some instances, when you register to use these custom features, your registration information will be shared with partner organizations. However, in every such case, you will be told about the intended sharing of your information prior to registering and you will have the option of not using the service. These relationships fall under two privacy policies, the SHiNE policy and the group or organization policy. It is important to note that the group or organization may abide by standards that differ from those of SHiNE. 

**V. Contests**  
When we run contests on our site, you may be asked to provide additional information in order to participate. The specific rules for any contest will state how that information may be used to the extent that it is different from this policy. If the contest is produced in partnership with a partner or sponsor, the information may be shared as SHiNE's policy in regard to partners and sponsor allows (above). 

**VI. Links**  
Users should be aware that when you are on SHiNE, you may be directed other sites as resources or relevant links. SHiNE does its best to refer sites that provide information or services that are helpful to the SHiNE audience. However, we do not control the privacy policies of these external sites, and do not accept any liability from difficulties arising from the use of one of these external links.
