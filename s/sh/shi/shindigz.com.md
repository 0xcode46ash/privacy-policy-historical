**ShindigZ Privacy Policy**

Our customers’ privacy is our number one concern. That is why we take every precaution to make sure that all customer information is kept completely private. We will at no time sell, rent or give away any of our customers’ personal information – this includes their name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or any other information that is obtained on our order form. Bottom line is that we handle our customers’ personal information as we would want our own handled.

On occasion, we will send informational e-mails to you concerning ShindigZ information only. These would be specials; contest information or short messages containing information that we think you would want to know. If at any time you wish to stop receiving these e-mails, we give you the option to remove your name from our mailing list with one easy step.

In addition, in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we require parental consent on any information provided to us by children under the age of 13. We have provided links on our site to our privacy policy from all places where information can be gathered.

We do not request any information from children under 13 although we do gather information from parents wishing to enroll their children in our ShindigZ KidZ Birthday Club. This information includes the names, ages, gender, and birthdates of children registered by a parent. This information is used only for internal marketing reports and to provide relevant information to the parent a few weeks before their child’s birthday.

At no time is this information shared with third parties. Additionally, we do request e-mail consent from a parent if we receive information from a child under 13.

We want you to feel confident when ordering from ShindigZ, and we are doing everything we can to continue to operate a secure site, but if you have any other questions concerning site security or privacy issues, please feel free to e-mail us at [Customer Service](mailto:csr@shindigz.com) or call us toll free at 1-877-446-3449.
