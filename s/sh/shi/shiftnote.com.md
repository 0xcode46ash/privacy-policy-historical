**What This Privacy Policy Covers**

  * This policy covers how ShiftNote treats personal information that ShiftNote collects and receives, including information related to your past use of ShiftNote products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. 
  * This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ShiftNote does not own or control, or to people that ShiftNote does not employ or manage 



**Information Collection and Use**

_General_

  * ShiftNote collects personal information when you register with ShiftNote, when you use ShiftNote products or services, when you visit ShiftNote pages or the pages of certain ShiftNote partners, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. ShiftNote may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. 
  * When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. For some financial products and services we might also ask for your address, Social Security number, and information about your assets. When you register with ShiftNote and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. 
  * ShiftNote collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of financial products and services that we offer. 
  * ShiftNote automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, ShiftNote cookie information, and the page you request. 
  * ShiftNote uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. 



**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

  * ShiftNote does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 
    * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with ShiftNote under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help ShiftNote communicate with you about offers from ShiftNote and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 
    * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 
    * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of ShiftNote’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 
    * We transfer information about you if ShiftNote is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, ShiftNote will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
  * ShiftNote displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. 
    * ShiftNote does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. 
    * ShiftNote advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies). 
  * ShiftNote works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business 
  * **Cookies**
  * ShiftNote may set and access ShiftNote cookies on your computer. 
  * ShiftNote lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to ShiftNote’s cookies. 
  * ShiftNote uses web beacons to access ShiftNote cookies inside and outside our network of web sites and in connection with ShiftNote products and services. 



**Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences**

_General_

  * You can edit your ShiftNote Account Information, including your marketing preferences, at any time. 
  * New categories of marketing communications might be added to the Marketing Preferences page from time to time. Users who visit this page can opt out of receiving future marketing communications from these new categories or they can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages they receive. 
  * We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the ShiftNote service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the ShiftNote Newsletter, that are considered part of your ShiftNote account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. 



**Confidentiality and Security**

  * We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. 
  * We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you. 



**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

  * ShiftNote may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your ShiftNote account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
