# Privacy Policy | SHIFT eLearning

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how we collect and use visitors’ and customers’ information as part of our Site and our Service.

 **Information You Provide**

The information SHIFT collects and uses is limited to the purpose for which customers engage SHIFT. When You register for the Service, We may ask for information such as your name, company name and address, site name, phone number, e-mail address and may redirect you to a third party site for secure payments. If You sign-up for a free trial account, You are not required to enter financial information until You decide to continue with a paid plan. SHIFT does not store any credit card numbers and uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on SHIFT’s behalf.

SHIFT may use the personal information and other information We collect about your use of the Service to operate the Service and tailor it to your needs, for billing, internal record keeping, identification and authentication, to contact You about your use of the Service, technical support, send you marketing materials (subject to your opt-out option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service and the Site.

SHIFT may also share your personal information with its third-party vendors (such as its credit card processor) and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other services We use to operate the Service and maintain quality user experience. Although SHIFT owns all rights to the software, code, databases, and other Service applications, You retain all rights to your data. Our service providers may not use your personal information for marketing purposes.

 **Cookies**

Cookies help us promptly display the information You need and other information which We consider to be of interest to You. By gathering and remembering information about your website preferences through cookies We can provide a better web and marketing experience. 

We also use “persistent cookies” that only We can read and use, to identify You as a SHIFT customer and make it easier for You to log into the Service.

Essential cookies: Some of the cookies We use are critical to the functionality of our Site. They are used to keep a user logged into the Site and remember relevant information when the user returns to the Site and uses the Service.

 **Log Files**

As is true with most web sites, SHIFT gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. In our secure customer area we may track all user activity for management and critical system operations.  Occasionally We may connect personal information to data gathered in our log files, as necessary to improve the Service to individual customers. Otherwise. We mostly use this information with no connection to individual users, to analyze trends, administer the Site, or track usage of various features within the Site.

 **Links to Other Sites**

Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website.

From time to time, We post customer testimonials on the Site which may contain personal information. We always obtain the customers’ consent to post their names along with their testimonials.

 **Information Sharing**

Except as described in this Policy, SHIFT will not give, sell, rent or loan any personal information to any third party. We may disclose such information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. SHIFT may also provide non-personal, summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal information.

 **Protection of Information**

SHIFT is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. We take precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information placed on the Site or used within the Service, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully-developed security procedures. For example, when You enter sensitive information (such as login credentials and all your activity on our Service platform) We encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to You and to those You authorized access.

 **Generally**

In providing our Service We do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact We are unaware of what information is actually being stored on our platform and only access such information as authorized by our customers or as required by law. Only You are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such information. As such, We are only the “data processors” and not the “data controllers” of the information on our platform.
