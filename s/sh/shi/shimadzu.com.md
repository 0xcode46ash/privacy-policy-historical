# Shimadzu - Privacy Policy

Shimadzu Corporation welcomes you to our web presence, and we hope we are able to supply you with any information you are seeking. Being responsible for a global website presence, we are also aware of the privacy and personal issues inherent, and take this opportunity to describe our internet 'Privacy Policy' 

All of our websites have been created to provide internet users with information about Shimadzu and our line of products and services, and as well as accessible technical and customer support. 

However, as the technology and scope of the world wide web has increased, so has the potential for gathering information about internet users. While visiting our website(s), access records are being logged about what website 'pages' are being viewed and their frequency, including downloaded items, and the location of the viewing parties. This information is solely used by us to gage our website performance and accessibility. What is NOT captured is individual data about website viewers, e-mail addresses or name/company information. 

There are specific areas of our website(s) which use a programming function known as 'cookies', which record information about your visit to our website on your hard drive. This is NOT considered a security risk, and only records information which you provide us. This information is NOT available to other websites. 

There are locations on our website which ask for personal information about the user, such as name, organization, email, etc. This information is logged for our own records, and occasionally used for 'leads' and demographic information. 

None of the information we collect about users of our website will ever be sold, distributed or given to outside parties. 

If you have any questions or comments about our policy or anything else concerning our websites, please contact us at [webmaster@shimadzu.com](mailto:webmaster@shimadzu.com)
