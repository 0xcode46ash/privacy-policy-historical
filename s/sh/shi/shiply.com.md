This information may include information such as the URL that you came from, which URL you go to next, your computer browser information, and your IP address.

If you choose to list shipments, or bid on shipments on the Site, we collect information about your activity and behaviour. We also collect other users’ comments about you in our feedback area.

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, phone calls or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.

If you email a shipment listing to a friends, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  These details will not be stored and will only be used to send the one-time email.

Uses of Your Information

We use your personal information, including your email address, to help facilitate our services to you. We use your personal information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site to: resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote safe bid acceptance; collect fees owed; measure consumer interest in our products and services; inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our User Agreement; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.

Communications from the Site.

We will occasionally send you information on products, services, and promotions, as well as a newsletter. You are signed up for these emails at registration and you may unsubscribe at any time by going to your account and opting out, or by following the directions to unsubscribe in the email.

Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe from each of these communications.

It is our policy not to make any personal information available to any third parties.

Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, rent or share any of your personal information, including your email address, to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services.

Your Shiply User ID is displayed throughout the Site and is therefore available to the public. All of your activities on the Site will be identifiable to your User ID. Other members can see your bids, shipments you have listed, your feedback rating and associated comments, your postings on the Site etc. Therefore, if you associate your name with your User ID, the people you have revealed your name to will be able to personally identify your Shiply activities. If you are involved in a successful bid (whether as a user or service provider), we have features that allow parties to the bid to view your email address and obtain your contact information in order to complete the shipment. 

Shiply cooperates fully with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the Shiply marketplace. Therefore, in response to a genuine request by law enforcement relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, address, telephone number, email address, User ID history, fraud complaints, bidding and listing history and any information we have on file for your account. We will not however otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity.

Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example we may be forced to disclose personal information, including your email address, to the government or credible third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or members may abuse/misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

Log Files

As is true of most Web sites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information in any way.

We use a third-party tracking service called Omniture that uses cookies and log files to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. We track trends in users’ usage and volume statistics to create a more efficient and usable site, and to determine areas of the site that could be improved to enhance the user experience.

Links to Other Sites

The Shiply Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Shiply. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.

Access to Personally Identifiable Information

If your personally identifiable information, including your email address, changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on our member Account page or by contacting [customer service.](https://web.archive.org/support)

Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information, including your email address, submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Business Transitions

In the event Shiply goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information, including your email address, will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

Changes in this Privacy Statement

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please check it regularly.
