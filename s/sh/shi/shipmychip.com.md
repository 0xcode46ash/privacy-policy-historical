# Privacy Policy - Ship My Chip

To process your order, we require your name, billing address, phone number, email address and credit card information. We use this information to process your order and, if any questions should arise, to contact you about your order. 

If we need to contact you, we will contact you via email first. If unsuccessful (or time is critical), we will try to contact you by phone. 

Any information provided by you will be used for shipmychip.com purposes only. However, we may need to provide your name and delivery address to third parties that are involved in the processing of your order used for delivering specific services to you (for example, the financial institution that issued your credit card or the courier that delivers your order). 

Your information will not be shared with individual or other companies (such as direct mail organizations or other third parties) unless required by law. 

There are times when we may request information from you, such as your, name, address and email address. When additional information is requested, we will try to let you know at the time of collection how we intend to use the personal information you provide, such as respond to your inquiry, accept an order, conduct a survey or allow you to access specific information such as account information, etc. We do our best to maintain the accuracy of any personal information you do supply to us. 

You can help us update and maintain the accuracy of any personal information you supply by logging in to the site and updating your account pages or notifying us about any changes to your address, title, phone number or email address.
