The Society for Human Resource Management has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for SHRM Online. 

We track IP address to measure traffic on our site. We do not use IP addresses to determine any user's identity. SHRM Online requires users to accept cookies. These cookies save your password so you don't have to re-enter during your session. In addition, other cookies from our site restrict the number of searches SHRM members can perform daily in our online member directory and coordinate banner advertising seen on the site. 

SHRM Online contains links to other sites. The Society is not responsible for the privacy practices of such Web sites. Inclusion of links to an outside web site, whether in an advertisement or content area of SHRM Online, is not an endorsement of the web site or a guarantee that the information it contains is accurate. 

Throughout SHRM Online there are forms for customers to request information, products, and services. These forms typically ask for contact information (such as your phone or e-mail address), unique identifiers (usually your SHRM membership number, if one is available), financial information (such as your credit card numbers), and demographic information (for example, your age, location, PHR/SPHR designation, etc.) Contact information from these order forms is used to send the products, promotional materials or membership that you request. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Forms on our site that request financial information do so in order to bill the user for products or services ordered. Unique identifiers (specifically, your SHRM member number) are collected from Web site visitors to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site 

We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. 

**Public Forums**

This site makes chat rooms and message boards available to its users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. Although users may post messages that will appear on the message boards anonymously, SHRM does retain a record of who posts all notes. 

**Security**

This site uses firewalls to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
