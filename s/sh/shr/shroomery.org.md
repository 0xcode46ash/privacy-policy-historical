# Privacy statement - Shroomery Message Board

Due to the subject matter of The Shroomery, many visitors are concerned about maintaining their privacy and anonymity while browsing the site. This document explains when and why we might store information about you without your explicit consent, and how you can prevent such information from being recorded. You may wish to visit our [Security & Safety](http://shroomery.org/forums/postlist.php?Cat=&Board=safety) forum on our [Message Boards](http://www.shroomery.org/forums) for further information and assistance. _IP Logging:_  
Your IP address is like your telephone number on the internet. It may change from time to time, but while you have it, it's unique to your computer. IP addresses can be used to determine the identity of your ISP (internet service provider), and to discover their general geographic location. Your ISP keeps log files which can be used to match your IP address with your account information.

Like most websites, The Shroomery maintains an access log which includes IP address information. This is done for our security and yours. These logs are deleted from the server periodically, but we make no specific guarantees about their longevity. We reserve the right to log IPs at any time. To prevent your IP address from being logged you must access the site through a proxy server. The site's functionality may be impaired when using a proxy. 

_Technical Information:_  
Our access logs also contain technical information about our users' computers, including (but not limited to) their browsers, operating systems, and what sites referred them to the Shroomery. Technical information is retained and used by the Shroomery to improve site compatibility and guide development. It may be shared in aggregate with third parties, but no personally identifiable information will be made available. To prevent technical information about your computer from being logged you must access the site using a proxy server or a third party web anonymizer. The site's functionality may be impaired when technical information about the user's computer is not available. 

_Cookies:_  
Cookies are small pieces of data which the Shroomery stores on your hard drive. The cookies we set can only be read by the Shroomery - your web browser will not allow any other site to access the data. Cookies have an expiration date, so that they don't stay on your hard drive indefinitely. Your browser automatically deletes cookies which have expired.

The Shroomery sets many cookies to enhance the browsing experience. They are used to store user preferences, technical data, and for statistical tracking. You can prevent the Shroomery from setting cookies on your hard drive by configuring your web browser to reject cookies, to prompt you before accepting them, or by installing a third party cookie utility. The site's functionality may be impaired when cookies are disabled.

_Usage:_  
The Shroomery will never sell, give, share or transfer any information we collect about our users, except as outlined below: 

  * In the event that the Shroomery is served with a legal subpoena, we will provide the information as required by law. 
  * In the event a user is attempting to disrupt/undermine the server/community, we reserve the right to report them to their ISP and any applicable authorities.
  * We may provide aggregate user information to third parties such as advertisers, but no personally identifiable information will be made available.



The Shroomery is very concerned with maintaining our users' privacy and we are constantly striving to create a secure and anonymous environment. Please feel free to [contact us](http://www.shroomery.org/support) with any questions or concerns you may have.
