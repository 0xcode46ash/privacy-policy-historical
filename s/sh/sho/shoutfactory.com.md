In general, you can visit Shout! Factory's Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Shout! Factory strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy, and although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Shout! Factory intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy.

Factory uses cookies to improve the quality of our service and to understand our user base more. Shout! Factory does this by storing user preferences and information in these cookies. Shout! Factory will not disclose its cookies to third parties except as required by a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.

**What Information Do We Collect?**

Shout! Factory collects and stores the information you enter through our website as part of a registration and purchasing process. Certain personal or identifying information may include: name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, and, if applicable, credit card number. Shout! Factory may also store information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, and the IP address of the machine you used to submit your personal information. Shout!

Any personal information about you that you submit may be used to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, to improve our content, and personalize Shout! Factory's offerings. These uses are intended to tailor the site to better enhance your experience. 

Except as expressly disclosed herein, Shout! Factory does not sell, rent, or trade your personal information except within Shout! Factory, to Shout! Factory's third-party service providers (which may include business partners, sponsors and advertisers), and to financial institution(s) that processes your credit card transactions, unless required by law via any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order. If you choose to provide us with your personal information on the Web, we may transfer such information as described above. Without your prior consent, we will not use your personal identifiable information for any purpose other than that for which it is submitted.

**Third Party Providers**

As described above, third-party providers are companies that make available services on behalf of Shout! Factory, ShoutFactory.com, and any other owned or related entities. To those third-party providers, Shout! Factory may provide personal information to help us deliver products, information, and services. Shout! Factory will take reasonable steps to ensure that any such third-party providers take similar steps to protect personal information on our behalf. Shout!

**Security**

Wherever your personal information may be held within Shout! Factory or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. 

To prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the strongest security available for websites. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, so that it cannot be read as the information travels from your personal computer to the receiving server. However, transmissions protected by industry standard technology and implemented by human beings can never be absolutely secure. Consequently, Shout! Factory will not be responsible for unauthorized disclosure of personal information due to no fault of Shout! Factory, including errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. 

**Access or Correct Your Personal Information**
