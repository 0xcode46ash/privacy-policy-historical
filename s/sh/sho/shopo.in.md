Information Sharing and Disclosure

When you post a message, your Shopo ID or alias is visible to other users. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Shopo may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Shopo Terms of Use. Shopo may disclose personally identifiable information to parties if Shopo in Shopo's sole discretion believes necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, Shopo may disclose name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email address and company name. Shopo may share aggregated demographic information with business partners.

Shopo is affiliated with a variety of businesses and works closely with them. These businesses may operate stores on the Shopo website or sell items to you from the Shopo website. Shopo may also provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. Due to the nature of Shopo's business model, when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, you will share customer information that is related to such transaction with that affiliated business.

Shopo might employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and needs to share your information with them to provide products and services to you. Examples include but are not limited to fulfilling orders, handling billing disputes and collections, analysing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service.

Shopo will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with non-affiliated parties except as specified in this Privacy Policy to provide products or services you have requested or when Shopo has your permission. It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Shopo's Terms of Use, as specified in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by law. In some cases, Shopo may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Shopo will transfer information about you if Shopo is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Shopo will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Shopo web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

As part of the buying and selling process, you may obtain another Shopo user's email address, shipping address and/or other information. Pursuant to Shopo's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use this information. This information should only be used for Shopo-related communications or for Shopo-facilitated transactions. Shopo has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages. Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any Shopo user to your email or physical mail list.

Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and Shopo's ability to keep the community free from bad players, Shopo will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order, legal process, or substantially similar legal procedure, except when Shopo believes in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to protect Shopo's rights, prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or to report suspected illegal activity.

Third Parties

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information Shopo collects from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are buyers or sellers on Shopo or throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.
