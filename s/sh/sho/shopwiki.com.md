# Help:Privacy - ShopWiki

#### Effective Date: January 24, 2007

This privacy policy describes the types of information ShopWiki Corp. collects from users of the Web site ShopWiki.com and how that information is used. Please read this policy carefully before providing any personal information to this Web site. ShopWiki reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any time by posting the changes on this Web site. We encourage you to check our privacy policy frequently. If we make material changes that will affect personal information that we have already collected from you, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the changes and to give you the opportunity to amend or cancel your registration.  Your continued use of this Web site constitutes your acceptance of the current posted privacy policy. If you have questions about our privacy policy, please email us at privacy@shopwiki.com.

### What data do we collect?

#### Unregistered users

We encourage you to register as a ShopWiki member to take advantage of many of the personalization features on ShopWiki. However, if you choose not to register, you can use any feature on our site that doesn't require registration.  
If you do not register, the information we collect from you is limited. We log your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, administer our Web site and track usage statistics. Your IP address may vary each time you visit, or it may be the same, depending on how you access our site. Either way, it would be extremely difficult for us to identify you through your IP address, and we make no attempt to do so. If you reached our site by clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, then we also log that information. This helps us to maximize our Internet exposure, and to understand the interests of our users. All of this information is collected and used only in the aggregate; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use it to generate overall reports on our visitors, but not reports about individual visitors. Your IP address will also enable us to estimate your zip code so we can approximate shipping and tax information within your search results.  
We also place a small file known as a "cookie" on your computer's hard drive. A cookie may contain information that allows us to track your path through our Web site and to determine whether you have visited us before. However, unless you register with us, it is not associated with personal information that would allow us to identify you. Cookies cannot be used to read data off of your hard drive and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other Web sites. We use cookies in this manner to help us understand how visitors use our site and to help us to improve our site. You may refuse to accept a cookie from us by following the procedures specific to your Web browser. Although you may do so, you may find that your browser reacts strangely when visiting not only our Web site, but other Web sites as well. Since cookies don't provide us with any information from which we can identify you, we suggest you allow us to place one on your computer.  
We also place “Web beacons” (also known as “clear gifs”) on many of our Web pages. Web beacons recognize a visitor’s cookie information and therefore gathers the information that allows us to understand how visitors use our site.

#### ShopWiki members

If you choose to register with us to become a ShopWiki member, you'll be able to write and edit wiki buying and gift guides and use all of the personalization features on our site. The benefits of membership will increase over time as we get to know you better and introduce new features. We encourage you to register as a member so that you can experience everything ShopWiki has to offer!  
To register as a member, you will be asked to select a user name and password and to provide your email address and possibly some demographic and interest information about yourself. This information is also associated with your personal wiki, product wishlists and other preferences. The information we collect varies, but we only collect the information that you voluntarily provide to our Web site, for example, by responding to our forms or completing your ShopWiki profile or contributing content to a ShopWiki product guide. We may store all or some of that information in a cookie file on your hard drive, so that our system will recognize you each time you visit our site. In that way, we can save your preferences from visit to visit and present you with a customized Web site, without requiring you to log into our site every time you visit.  Additionally, authorized ShopWiki personnel may update your membership information to accurately reflect any new information included in communications received from you.

#### ShopWiki Assistant

We offer the ShopWiki Assistant as a download on this Web site. The ShopWiki Assistant is an extension of the Firefox browser that automatically fills out forms at online merchants to make for a somewhat seamless shopping experience. If you choose to download and install the ShopWiki Assistant, it will prompt you to set up your personal options, including address and credit card information.  
The personal information that you provide to the ShopWiki Assistant is not sent to ShopWiki and resides only on your computer.

### How Do We Use The Personal Information We Collect?

As we mentioned above, we collect personal information only from our members. Becoming a ShopWiki member allows you to write and edit wiki buying and product guides and to personalize our Web site so that it is most useful to you. It also allows you to log into our site automatically each time you visit, rather than manually typing your user name and password at each visit. We may also use this information to periodically contact you with ShopWiki news or important information or to request your feedback on our site. In addition to these periodic updates, we may email you additional materials, but only if you specifically request them. These might include opt-in newsletters and other materials that you proactively request.

### Is The Personal Information We Collect Shared With Third Parties?

ShopWiki does not sell or rent any personal information to any third party for marketing purposes. We may aggregate personal information from all of our users and provide that information in the aggregate to other parties, including advertisers, for marketing purposes. However, if we do so, that information will not be in a form that will allow any third party to identify any user personally.  
ShopWiki may transfer the personal information it collects to its successors-in-interest, such as a company that acquires ShopWiki. ShopWiki may also disclose personal information about a user if it determines that an applicable law, regulation or legal process requires it, or if ShopWiki determines that it needs to share such information to protect or enforce ShopWiki's rights or the rights of another user.

### What Else Should A User Know About Our Privacy Practices?

#### Security

We maintain security measures in place in order to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the personally identifiable information under our control.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 percent secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, please be advised that ShopWiki assumes no responsibility or liability for disclosure of your information (personal or otherwise) due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other causes beyond ShopWiki’s control.

#### ShopWiki’s Service Providers

ShopWiki works with reputable companies to provide services to our Web site and to our users. The information that each of these companies collect about users of our Web site is governed by its privacy policy, and is not within the control of ShopWiki. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of our service providers, to ensure that you are comfortable with their practices

#### Links to Other Web Sites

ShopWiki does not control the privacy policies of any Web site linked from our Web site. If you click on a link, the privacy policy of the Web site that you link to will govern the collection and use of your information by that Web site's operators. ShopWiki assumes no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties with respect to their use of your information or otherwise. We recommend that you become familiar with the privacy policy of every Web site that you visit.

#### Disclosure of Information in Public Areas

If you voluntarily disclose personal information in a wiki contribution that is posted on our Web site, that information may be collected and used by a third party to send you unsolicited messages, advertisements or for other purposes. ShopWiki does not control the actions of users of our Web site. If you disclose personal information in a public area, you do so at your own risk.  In addition, we reserve the right to terminate the account of any ShopWiki member who uses our Web site in a manner inconsistent with the [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/wiki/Help:Terms+and+Conditions "Click here to see a Wiki article on this subject")

#### Collection of Information From Minors

Our Web site is directed to and intended for use by adults only. We require that a user be eighteen years of age or older to become a ShopWiki member (and in doing so, to submit personal information). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen, we will delete such information from our records.
