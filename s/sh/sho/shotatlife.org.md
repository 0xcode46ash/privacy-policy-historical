# Shot@Life - Privacy Policy

This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for the United Nations Foundation. The UN Foundation is committed to the privacy of those individuals who visit and interact with [shotatlife.org](http://shotatlife.org/) or [www.unfoundation.org](http://www.unfoundation.org/), and follows these practices.

By visiting our website, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy"). The United Nations Foundation reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting such change here. Your continued use of the website after such change is made constitutes acceptance of and agreement to be bound by the terms of the Privacy Policy as modified.

**What personally-identifiable information does the United Nations Foundation and Shot@Life collect on its site, and how is it used?**

The UN Foundation is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us, by, for example, filling out a survey or registration form. The UN Foundation collects information from our users at several different points on our web site.

You may opt out of receiving communications from us by sending an e-mail to [info@shotatlife.org](mailto:info@shotatlife.org) with your complete name, address, and e-mail address. The UN Foundation assumes no responsibility for the data collection and use practices of third parties that process online credit card transactions.

**Newsletter and UN Wire**

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter and/or UN Wire, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. The UN Foundation may ask for additional information, such as content preferences. This information is used to contact the user/subscriber about the news for which they have expressed an interest. It is optional for the user/subscriber to provide demographic information (such as country, or zip code), but encouraged so that we can provide a more personalized and customized experience on the UN Foundation site.

**Surveys & Quizzes **

From time-to-time the UN Foundation or Shot@Life may request information from users via surveys or quizzes -- generally as part of our continuing efforts to improve our family of web sites. Participation in these surveys or quizzes is completely voluntary. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and postal address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). This information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving our sites.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on the UN Foundation site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user will be able to access quiz results, or other interactive features made possible only through the implementation of cookies. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site, but again, this is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information.

The cookies shall only be used to obtain non-personal information to improve your online experience. No other information is stored in these cookies.  You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and delete any cookies you receive.

**Log Files**

The UN Foundation uses the IP address from your Internet connection to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to any personally identifiable information.

**Sharing**

The UN Foundation may share aggregated demographic information with our site partners.

The UN Foundation partners with other parties to provide specific services, such as UN Wire. When the user signs up for these services, we will only share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

**Donations to the UN Foundation's Shot@Life**

We request information from the user on our donation form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customers’ orders. If we have trouble processing a donation, this information is used to contact the user. Our donations are processed real-time using secure Verisign credit card processing technology.

**Links**

The Shot@Life website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code or email address), or if a user no longer desires to subscribe to UN Wire or any of our services, the UN Foundation will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our staff at [info@shotatlife.org](mailto:info@shotatlife.org).

**Email Choice/Opt-out**

The UN Foundation provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at any time. Users who no longer wish to receive UN Foundation communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying with "unsubscribe" in the subject line of the email or clicking on the unsubscribe link in the email itself.

**Referral Services**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. The UN Foundation will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site. The UN Foundation stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact us at [info@shotatlife.org](mailto:info@shotatlife.org) to request the removal of this information from our database.

**Surveys**

We may conduct occasional online surveys via our website or via an email newsletter. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may decline to participate.

**Notification of Changes**

If the UN Foundation decides to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this page so our users are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
