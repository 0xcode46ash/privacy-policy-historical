_What information does Shoprunner gather?_

There are times when Shoprunner may need to gather specific information from you such as your name and address, among other personal information. Information that is essential for Shoprunner to provide the services and/or products that are requested by you is generally designated as "Required". Additional information that would allow Shoprunner flexibility in providing its services or products, and may be used for internal statistical studies or market research, is generally indicated as "Optional". For example, a credit card number is required when ordering a product, whereas a fax number may not be essential, but would provide another means of communication between you and Shoprunner. 

The choice of how much personally identifiable information you disclose to Shoprunner is completely at your discretion. It is never mandatory for you to answer any question, although it may limit the services and products that Shoprunner is able to offer. 

_How does Shoprunner use personal information?_

When you submit personal information to Shoprunner, you understand that you are agreeing to allow Shoprunner, its subsidiaries, and its affiliates, access to, storage of, and use of, the data in any of the countries where Shoprunner, its subsidiaries, and its affiliates, do business. 

Shoprunner may use the personal information you submit for any purposes related to Shoprunner's business, including, but not limited to, generating statistical studies, conducting market research, improving its products and services, sending you surveys, and notifying you of product upgrades and updates, new products, special offers, seminars and conventions and any other changes within Shoprunner may affect you. 

_Does Shoprunner share the information that it gathers with third parties?_

Shoprunner only shares the information with other Shoprunner agents. Should you decide you would not like your information shared, please use the contact information below to request that Shoprunner deactivate you from its lists. Please note, however, that certain customer records must be maintained by their respective resellers and by Shoprunner for accountability reasons. 

If you continue to receive materials from third parties after informing Shoprunner to deactivate your name, please notify the particular third parties regarding deactivation of your personal information. 

_What is Shoprunner's commitment to data security?_

Shoprunner recognizes your concern for security, and will use reasonable efforts to establish secure connections with you and to limit access to databases containing personal information to authorized personnel only.
