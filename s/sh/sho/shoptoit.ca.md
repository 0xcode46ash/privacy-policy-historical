Here at shoptoit.ca, we want to build a level of trust with our customers. Your privacy is an important part of that trust, and is the reason why we do our best to protect your personal information. Please take the time to read through this page and understand what this policy is all about.

  


### Cookies

Cookies are small files placed on your hard drive by websites that you visit. They contain snippets of information (such as your username and password), allowing certain settings to be displayed upon return visits to a website. On shoptoit.ca, certain features require us to use cookies.

The ability to block cookies is available in your browser's control panel. Be aware that by doing so, certain functions of shoptoit.ca may not operate. Blocking cookies is not recommended.

  


### Merchant Websites

shoptoit.ca acts as a shopping portal to our merchant websites. Because our merchants' privacy policies differ from our own, it is important to read and understand them upon entering their site. It is also important to understand that when you are making a purchase, you will be making it through these merchant websites and not shoptoit.ca. The information collected during the time of purchase will fall under the merchant's privacy policy.
