When you enter Sensitive PII, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology ("SSL"). Sensitive PII may include your drivers license, credit card number, social security number or Protected Health Information, as may be applicable. While we do work very hard to protect your privacy, no method of security is 100% effective and we cannot be responsible for the actions of those who may gain unauthorized access to your personal information.
