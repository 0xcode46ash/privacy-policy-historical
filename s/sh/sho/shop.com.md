        Shop.com collects a variety of general and personal information about you. We collect general information about you when you visit our web site. This information includes technical information related to your computer and the manner in which you are accessing our site and includes such information as the internet protocol (IP) address of your computer, what operating system your computer is using, what browser software (e.g., Explorer, Netscape or other) your computer is using, and who your internet service provider is, the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the web site from which you just came and the URL to which you go next and certain operating metrics, such as the amount of time you use our service. 

        In addition, if you register for certain services at Shop.com, then during your registration process with Shop.com, we may ask you to provide us with personal information including, but not limited to your name, email address and areas of interest. From time to time, we may ask you to update your personal information so that we may offer more personalized services to you.   
  
2.        How is the information used? 

        Shop.com uses your information to monitor general use of our service and to provide personalized service to you and to better serve you, our advertisers and our sponsors. For example, we may use the personal information that you have provided us to send an e-mail in response to a question that you have asked. In addition, we may, from time to time, send e-mail messages to you regarding shopping opportunities that we think may be of interest to you. 

        The general information that we gather about you is aggregated with general information of all users to help us better understand how our service is used. In addition, we aggregate the general information and the personal information. We compile and analyze this aggregated information so that we can provide more meaningful information to advertisers and sponsors and more relevant content and advertisements to you. 

        In addition, as discussed below under the subtitle "With whom do we share the information?" we may release your information to law enforcement agencies in certain situations.

        We may ask your permission to release your personal information to a third party. If you consent to such release, then that third party will have access to your information. If you do not consent, then we will not release your personal information to that third party. 

        We may contain links to other sites from our web site. Shop.com does not control the content or practices of any other site, including what information those sites collect about you.

In addition, you may choose to respond to advertisements that are posted on our web site or to direct marketing offers from third party sponsors or advertisers. We do not control the content or practices of our sponsors or advertisers and, accordingly, we do not hold ourselves responsible for the privacy policies of any third party sponsors or advertisers who may collect information about you. 

        Shop.com cooperates with law enforcement agencies to identify those who use our services for illegal activities. Shop.com reserves the right to release information to law enforcement agencies about our registered users or any user of our Site who we believe is in violation of applicable law, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe may be unlawful.   
  
4.        What choices do you have regarding the collection and use of information about you? 

        It is Shop.com's policy not to share user personal information with third parties who would use such information for direct marketing purposes. From time to time, we may contact you directly via email to make you aware of changes to our Site or the Service, to respond to questions or to deliver direct marketing material that we believe is appropriate for you. You may elect to opt-in or opt-out of the receipt of direct marketing material from us by sending an email to [privacy@shop.com](mailto:privacy@shop.com); provided, however, that Shop.com shall be entitled to a commercially reasonable time after receipt of such election or modification to implement any changes to your election.   
  
5.        What are "Cookies" and how are they used? 

        A "Cookie" is a very small text file placed on your hard drive by a web server. 

        We use cookies for a variety of reasons. For example, a cookie may be used to identify each user who accesses our Site and to obtain session information for users of our Site. We may use this information to deliver a more personalized service to our users. In addition, cookies allow advertisers and merchants to track responsiveness to their marketing efforts and to process transactions at their online stores. Thus, we allow advertisers or partners to set cookies, but only if they agree to comply with our privacy policy. 

        Please note that, in addition to allowing you to accept all cookies, your internet browser software may also allow you to be warned before accepting a cookie or to reject all cookies. Our Service is dependent on the acceptance of cookies by our Members.
