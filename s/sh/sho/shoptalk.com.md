Online Privacy Statement

At Shoptalk Networks, Inc., ("Shoptalk") we are committed to protecting your privacy. You can travel through most of our site without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. Please read the complete Shoptalk privacy statement. 

1\. Collecting your Personal Information.  
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to register before ordering e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access site or when registering for Shoptalk information, including white papers and other marketing materials. Personal information collected by Shoptalk often is limited to e-mail address, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested. If you provide us with your email or postal address, or have done so in the past, we may use it to send you updates on the latest Shoptalk offerings.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering information, answering customer questions about products or services and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

Shoptalk will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Shoptalk or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Shoptalk and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Shoptalk, its Web site, or the public.

Shoptalk will never knowingly collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 13.

2\. Data Security.  
Shoptalk is committed to protecting the individual identifying information that you provide to us and has reasonable security measures in place to protect against loss or misuses of information under its control.

3\. Control of your Personal Information.  
When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, Shoptalk will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above.
