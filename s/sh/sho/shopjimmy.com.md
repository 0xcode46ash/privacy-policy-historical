# ShopJimmy Contact & FAQ

  


## SEARCH FOR A PART

### • How do I search for a TV part?

We always recommend searching by TV part number. Partial searches do work. If you don't know how to find your part number, please contact us and we'll be glad to help you. You can also find the brand of the TV and filter by your TV model number and navigate to your specific part. 


### • What if the part I want is out of stock?

If you go to that part's product page, you'll see a big, green "Sign up to be notified…" button. Once you login to your ShopJimmy account (if you're not already logged-in), it will set a "Product Alert" for you (you can manage these in your "Account Dashboard") and we will email you when the part is back in-stock 


### • What if I'm not sure which part I need?

Contact us. Call us. Email us. Live Chat with us. We’re happy to help you figure it out. 


## COMMON QUESTIONS

### • Do you have a catalog?

We don't have a catalog. Since our inventory changes rapidly, it's easier for us to stay up-to-date if we display our inventory online. And we like saving trees. 


### • Do I need a customer account to make a purchase?

Nope! You can checkout as a guest. If you do plan on ordering TV parts from us more than once, however, we suggest that you create an account! All of your information is secure and safe. We'll never give your contact information to third parties. For added security, we DO NOT keep your financial information on file. 


### • How do I set-up a customer account?

Click "My Account" at the top right of any page to set-up your account. You can also call us, and one of our friendly Customer Service Representatives will help you set-up your account. All of your information is secure and safe. We'll never give your contact information to third parties. You can save your payment information, but for added security, we DO NOT keep your financial information on file (it's stored through a secure third-party payment gateway). 


### • Do you price match other replacement parts distributors?

Yes! We will match any in-stock, distributor price (with a 90-day warranty). If you see a lower price online, call or email us. Show us the link to our competitor’s page with their pricing, and if they have a 90-day warranty and the part is in-stock, we’ll match their price! Any other customer/group discounts will not be added/applied to Price Match quotes. While we offer customer discounts to frequent buyers, we don't match competitors' customer discounts. 


### • Do you price match eBay sellers?

Yes and no. We review these on a case-by-case basis. Show us a link to their product’s pricing, and we’ll work with you to determine a fair price. 


### • How do I update my customer information?

Click “My Account” at the top right of any page to login to your account. From there, you will find “My Dashboard,” where you'll be able to edit all of your customer information. 


### • What if I forgot my password?

Please call or email us and we'll help you reset your password. 


### • When will you ship my order and when will I receive it?

If you place an order before 3:15 pm CST (Monday - Friday), we will ship your order that day! All purchases made after 3:15 pm CST will ship the next business day. Unless you upgrade your shipping method, any order in the US will arrive at your doorstep in 1-5 business days (depending on how close you live to us -- we're in Minnesota). Some of our products do have lead times, so please make sure to note that and factor it into your order's time-in-transit. 


### • Can I cancel my order after it's placed?

Unfortunately, our system doesn't allow that. You will need to contact our Returns Department once you receive your order to start the return and refund process. Your refund/credit may be subject to a Restocking Fee. 


## SHIPPING

### • Do you ship orders the same day?

Yes, we will ship any orders with in-stock products the same day before 3:15 pm CST (Monday - Friday). Any order placed after 3:15 pm CST will be shipped promptly the next business day (Monday - Friday). If your order contains back-ordered products, please reference those products' expected shipping date on their product page. Some of our products also do have lead times, so please make sure to note that and factor it into your order's time-in-transit. 


### • When will I receive tracking information for my order?

As soon as your order is inspected, packed and ready to ship, we will email you your tracking information. Please contact us immediately if you don't receive this information within one business day. 


### • Can you ship internationally?

Yes, we can ship our products to just about every country on this great, green Earth. We cannot ship to P.O. boxes at this time, however. 


## PAYMENT

### • What forms of payment do you accept?

We accept American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, PayPal, and credit card "gift certificates." 


### • Is it safe to use my credit card or debit card on your site?

## ABOUT US

### • Who the heck are you?

Glad you asked! We're a TV replacement parts supplier located in majestic, mild (we wish!) Burnsville, MN. We have a growing inventory of over 500,000 TV parts. Our specialty, besides rooting for the Twins and Vikings, are TV boards and DLP lamps and chips. We also sell refurbished TVs, universal TV stands, TV remotes, front projector lamps, and various other electronics accessories. Most importantly, we pride ourselves as having the lowest prices online, as well as, the best customer service in the industry! 


### • Where are you located?

Burnsville, MN. We try to incorporate our honest, Midwestern values in every facet of our business. 


### • What kind of inventory do you have?

The majority of our inventory is TV replacement parts, but we also carry refurbished TVs, universal TV stands, TV remotes, and various other electronics accessories. You can search our entire inventory by product type or keyword, such as "LCD" or "backlight inverter" or "Sony.” If you're looking for a replacement TV part, we suggest starting your search by its part number. 


### • Where do you get your parts?

The majority of our parts are reclaimed from new TVs damaged during freight shipping. We also source and manufacture certain TV parts to meet demand. 


### • Are your parts new or used?

Neither? Our parts are "reclaimed" or "harvested." Technically, we can't say they're "new" because they don't have an OEM number and we didn't purchase them from the manufacturer. But, they're not "used" because we reclaimed them from new TVs damaged during shipping. We do, however, source various "new" TV parts direct from manufacturers. 


### • Do you inspect your parts?

From reclaiming to shipping, all of our parts go through a three-point inspection. Our defective part return rate is around 3% (not too shabby for our industry) and dropping. 


### • Do you sell replacement TV screens?

We do offer a limited selection of **[panels](http://www.shopjimmy.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=panel&restrictBy\[master+part+type\]=Panel) **. 


### • What are you doing to better the environment?

Check out our "About Us" page. We have a pretty cool e-waste ticker that shows how many pounds of electronics waste we've recycled since 2007!

## SHOPJIMMY CUSTOMER REWARDS PROGRAM

We love our customers and want to reward loyalty and industry experience. Our ShopJimmy Customer Groups are our way of letting the cream rise to the top (in Jimmy's case, he'd prefer sour cream). Here is how these groups work…

Every week, we run an evaluation that looks at the past three months of sales and returns. We then average the sales and calculate return rates, accounting for defective returns and "wrong part sent" orders. We also add a little more padding to the return rate to make sure we didn't miss anything. We want to give you the benefit of the doubt, of course.

With these two data points -- average sales and return rate over the past three months -- we separate everyone into our customer groups. We upgrade accounts weekly and downgrade accounts monthly. Easy enough, right?

  


## SHOPJIMMY GROUP LEVELS

  
Group| Monthly Sales Average| Monthly Return Rate| Order Discount| Shipping Discount| Other Perks  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| More than $300| Less than 5%| 20% | Free shipping on orders over $75, $6 2-day upgrade on orders over $100 (US only) | DLP lamp discounts, No restocking fees  
| More than $200| Less than 10%| 15% | Free shipping on orders over $100, $8 2-day upgrade on orders over $120 (US only) | DLP lamp discounts, No restocking fees  
| More than $100| Less than 15%| 10% | Free shipping on orders over $150, $10 2-day upgrade on orders over $150 (US only) | DLP lamp discounts  
  
## MORE WAYS TO SAVE

If you find a lower price from another distributor (in-stock, 90-day warranty), we will match that  
price and it will be another order toward you getting into a better ShopJimmy discount group.

If you have 2+ DLP lamps in an order, you will receive free shipping on that order.

### SECURITY

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to ensure the privacy and security of your personal information and payment information. We never keep payment information on file. We secure and adjust payment information every transaction. For billing and management, you will be able to view the type of credit card used and the last four digits of the card. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website please contact us.

### TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES / COOKIES

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal information you submit while on our site. We use session ID cookies: a session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.

### WEB BEACONS / GIFS

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a., web beacons/web bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”
