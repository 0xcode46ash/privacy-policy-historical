# Shopbop privacy policy

**Shopbop Privacy Notice**  
Last updated: August 21, 2008.  
Shopbop knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. **By visiting Shopbop, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.**

**What Personal Information About Customers Does Shopbop Gather?**  
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at Shopbop. Here are the types of information we gather.

  * **Information You Give Us:** We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. Click here to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our store, and communicating with you.
  

  * **Automatic Information:** We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Shopbop. Click here to see examples of the information we receive.
  


  * **E-mail Communications:** To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we might receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Shopbop if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your [Email Preferences](https://web.archive.org/actions/myaccount/viewEmailPreferences.action) or unsubscribe by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any Shopbop e-mail.
  

  * **Information from Other Sources:** We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. Click here to see examples of the information we receive.
  

  
**What About Cookies?**  


  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.
  

  * The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Shopbop's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to complete a purchase in our store.
  

  


**Does Shopbop Share the Information It Receives?**  
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with our parent corporation, Amazon.com, Inc., and the subsidiaries it controls. 

  

  * **Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:** We work closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases, these businesses might sell offerings to you directly through Shopbop. In other cases, we might sell product lines jointly with these businesses. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customer information related to those transactions with that third party.
  

  * **Third-Party Service Providers:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
  

  * **Promotional Offers:** Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Shopbop customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your [Email Preferences](https://web.archive.org/actions/myaccount/viewEmailPreferences.action) or unsubscribe by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any Shopbop e-mail.
  


  * **Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that BOP LLC, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  

  * **Protection of Shopbop and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our [Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/ci/aboutShopBop/conditions.html) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Shopbop, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
  


  * **With Your Consent:** Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.



**How Secure Is Information About Me?**

  * We work to protect the security of your information during order transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts order information you transmit.
  

  * We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
  

  * It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.



**What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Web Sites?**  
Our site might include third-party advertising and links to other Web sites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party Web sites.

These third-party Web sites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our Web site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party Web sites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.

Shopbop might also display targeted advertising based on personal information about users. Although Shopbop does not provide any personal information to advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a targeted advertisement meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad (for example, users in the northwestern United States who like designer jeans). 

**Which Information Can I Access?**  
Shopbop gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with Shopbop for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. 

**What Choices Do I Have?**

  * As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase.
  

  * You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the "Which Information Can I Access?" section above. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
  

  * If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your [Email Preferences](https://web.archive.org/actions/myaccount/viewEmailPreferences.action) or unsubscribe by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any Shopbop e-mail.
  

  * The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Shopbop's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to complete a purchase in our store.



**Are Children Allowed to Use Shopbop?**  
Shopbop does not sell products for purchase by children. If you are under 18, you may use Shopbop only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

**Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions**  
If you choose to visit Shopbop, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our [Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/ci/aboutShopBop/conditions.html), including limitations on damages, disputes, and choice of law. If you have any concern about privacy at Shopbop, please email [ service@Shopbop.com](https://web.archive.org/customerservice/contact_customerservice.jsp) with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.

Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the [Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/ci/aboutShopBop/conditions.html) will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
