**INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU**

Information we, our service providers and other third-parties, collect from you will vary, depending on how you use the Services and information you may choose to provide to us (whether through email, phone, internet or otherwise). Personal Information: We, our service providers and other third-parties, may require Customers who visit the Services and/or purchase products on the Services to give us personally identifiable information (“personal data”). Personal data is individually identifiable information about you, including, but not limited to, your full name, a user name and password, email address, phone number, physical address, financial information, and your credit card information and other billing information. Information in a form that is anonymized, or is otherwise not capable of being associated with you, will not be considered personal data, and will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy as to use, sharing or otherwise. You can choose not to provide us with personal data, but then you may not be able to fully take advantage of certain features of our Services and we may not be able to provide you with certain requested information, products and/or services. Tracking and cookies: Like many Web sites on the Internet, we may track certain information about you as you visit and use our Services to help us (i) better understand, improve and modify the Services, (ii) better understand how the Services are used and experienced, and (iii) better understand how we can enhance overall experience on one or more of the Services, including providing advertising and other information that is relevant to you. This tracked or automatically gathered information may include, among other things, your computer’s IP address (Internet Protocol address), browser type, the URLs and pages on the Services you’ve visited, sections of or content on pages on the Services on which you click or in which you are interested, the number of times you visit each page on the Services, what downloads and/or search queries you have made, and how long you spent on particular sections of the Services and on the Services generally. This automatically gathered data includes information provided through the use of "cookies", local storage, e-tags, log files and "clear GIFs" (described in more detail below). We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you. Information from Cookies: When you use our Services, we may send a small file to your computer or device (a “cookie”) which is stored there so that we can recognize your computer or device as a unique machine the next time you use the Services, and which also enables us to, among other things, tailor the Services to your needs. Further information about the cookies we use is set out in our [cookies policy ]. You can decline any cookies we use if your Internet browser permits. However, please note that by declining cookies, certain functionalities of the Services will not be available to you, including that if you block essential cookies (see our cookies policy for more details), you may not be able to establish a shopping cart session or make a purchase online through the Services. If you do not change your browser settings to decline cookies and continue to use our Services, we will assume you consent to us continuing to download cookies on your device. Additionally, some of our third-party service providers working on our behalf may also utilize their own cookies. Information from Clear GIFs: Also, we and our third-party service providers may use "clear GIFs" in connection with cookies and other website functions and emails. Clear GIFs perform administrative functions (but without detracting from your online experience), including being used to perform statistical and administrative tasks such as measuring traffic on the Services and its Web pages, verifying advertising avenues and positioning images on the web, and allowing us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and email marketing campaigns by letting us know which marketing emails have been opened by you or other recipients. However, please note that clear GIFs do not collect personal data. Information from e-tags and scripts: We and our third-party service providers use e-tags and scripts in analyzing trends, administering the Web site, tracking users’ movements around the site, and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis. Also, our third party partner may use technologies such as tags and scripts to gather information about your activities on this Web site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. Use of local storage: We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. Additionally, third-parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Web site or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use Flash cookies or HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. To manage Flash cookies, please click here. Advertising: As mentioned above, we may partner with third party ad network(s) to either display advertising on our Services or to manage our advertising on other Web sites. Our ad network partner may use cookies and/or Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on our Services and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.

You can edit or delete personal data that you submitted on the Services through your online account. Upon request Nasty Gal will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information. Under the Act, we may charge an administrative fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.

**HOW IS PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTED?**

Whenever personal data is stored on our computers, that information is protected from unauthorized access or use by way of passwords or other industry-acknowledged means. In addition, servers of ours that store this information are located behind a firewall. Since certain personal data (such as credit card data) is especially sensitive, we take special care to keep it secure. We will only electronically transmit or ask for this information over secure Internet connections using generally accepted standards, and security keys. In addition, we require password authentication from any third parties you have authorized to receive this information. We use a trusted third party payment processing service to process your payment to us and we do not store your credit/debit card information. You can elect to save your credit or debit card details once your order on our Web site has been processed, to make any future orders easier. However, for your security you will need to enter your card’s 3-digit security code for every subsequent transaction where you elect to use the saved credit/debit card. If you elect to store your credit or debit card details after an order on the Web site, your credit/debit card details will be stored with our trusted third party payment processor. Of course, we appreciate your help in safeguarding the integrity of your own and others' privacy. We hope you'll use common sense whenever you disclose personal data over the Internet. Just as importantly, we encourage you to let us know immediately if you suspect that personal data you share with us is being used in any way contrary to this Privacy Policy. Finally, unfortunately no data transmission over the Internet nor any storage of information on servers or other media can be guaranteed or made to be 100% secure; and while we strive to protect personal data, as outlined in this Privacy Policy, we cannot promise, guarantee or warrant the complete security of information. To contact us, please send an email to customerservices@nastygal.com. The data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing and processing, We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

 **SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY: OUTSIDE LINKS**
