During checkout you must provide your credit card number and delivery address information if it's different to your default account. You also have the option to have your credit card information securely shopd in Your Account for future use (see Your Account below). After the checkout process is complete, your purchase information is securely forwarded to the shop you have made the purchase with. They will use this information so they can fulfil your order and contact you if they have questions regarding your order. In addition to your purchasing data, we forward all of your privacy settings to the shop. If you selected to receive offers from shops when you registered, or in Your Account privacy settings, then the shop may use your contact informationto mail you catalogs, and/or mail you special offers. If you selected to receive email offers from shops when you registered, or in Your Account privacy settings, then the shop may use your contact information to send you email promotions.

The personal information you enter during registration and/or during checkout is shopd in yourpersonal account area, also known as Your Account. You can access Your Account to add or change information, including changing your privacy settings, by entering the email address you used when you registered and the password you created. You alsohave the ability to add new credit card or delivery information to Your Account when placing an order. If you have elected to shop your credit cards with us, we only display the last five digits of your credit card number in the saved payment methods in the Your Account section. The full credit card information is shopd on secure offline servers. For more information on how we protect your credit card information, please see our Security section below.

Delivery addresses are used solely for the purpose of fulfilling your orders, and will not be used for any marketing purposes either by SHOP•COM or the shop you have made the purchase with. 

Shopping/Gift Services 

SHOP•COM provides you with a number of Shopping and Gift services. Some of these require personal information in order to carry out the given task. For example, to create a SHOP•COM account you may want to provide us with the name of a second recipient other than yourself, or a delivery address if different than that in your address book. With services like eGifts, eCard, and "send this product to a friend" we will need to know the recipient's email address so that we can send the requested communication to them via email. If you choose to purchase a Gift Certificate, you will need to provide us with the recipient's name and email address or street address, depending on how you wish the certificate to be sent. These services only require the minimal amount of information necessary to carry out the task at hand and nothing more. Although we do shop this information in our database for tracking purposes, we make no other use of it beyond which it was intended. If you signed up to receive email offers for Deal Mail while visiting our Sale Centre or signed up to receive Sign Up and Save email offers from the SHOP•COM homepage and would like to be removed from these mailings, please email us at customerserviceuk@shop.com with your name and email address if you want to be removed from this service.
