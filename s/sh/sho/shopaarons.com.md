Aaron Rents, Inc., its divisions, including Aaron’s Sales and Lease Ownership, Aaron’s Corporate Furnishings, Aaron’s Office Furniture, Rimco, and Rimco and More The $99 a Month Store, MacTavish Furniture Industries, its subsidiary, Aaron Rents Canada, ULC, and its holding company, Aaron Investment Company (collectively referred to in this Privacy Statement as "we"), recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of ShopAarons.com (referred to in this Privacy Statement as our “Web Site”), recipients of our advertisements, holders of our credit cards, and all other customers of our products and services. We created this policy with a fundamental respect for our customers' right to privacy and to guide our relationships with our customers. This Privacy Statement discloses the privacy practices for all of our products and services. ****A current list of our advertisements, products, services, and events can be found on our Web Site. By doing business with us or by using our Web Site, you consent to the privacy practices described in this statement.

For the purpose of this Privacy Statement, “personal information” means information about an identifiable individual.

**Collection of your Personal Information**

We collect information about you to conduct our business and deliver the top-quality service you expect. 

Sources may include: (1) information we receive from you; (2) information we receive from third parties, such as consumer reporting agencies, to verify statements you have made to us, or regarding your employment, credit, or other relationships; and (3) information about your previous transactions with us. 

We collect personal information about you only when you voluntarily provide it to us or consent to our obtaining it from third parties. Typically, we will seek consent for the use or disclosure of your personal information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when we want to use information for a purpose not previously identified).

The form of consent that we seek, including whether it is express or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of the individual in the circumstances.

You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. If you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, please contact our Privacy Officer by any of the ways described in the “Contact Information” section below. We will inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent. 

We may collect personal information from you at our stores or on our Web Site. This information can include your name, home and work addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail address, postal code, vehicle information, personal references, banking information, and internet preferences. We also collect anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your postal code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites.

Our Web Site automatically collects information about your computer hardware and software. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web Site addresses. We use this information to operate our Web Site, to maintain the quality of the service on our Web Site, and to provide general statistics regarding the use of our Web Site.

We encourage you to review the privacy statements of web sites you choose to link to from our Web Site so that you can understand how those web sites collect, use and share your information. We are not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on web sites outside of our Web Site and our family of web sites. 

**Use of your Personal Information**

We collect and use your personal information to deliver the services you have requested, respond to your customer service inquiries, advise you about new products and services that may be of interest to you, process and administer any on-line order forms you may submit, bill you for our products and services, collect outstanding debts, and research, develop and improve our services. With your permission, which you grant us by completing and submitting the on-line order form, the personal information contained in your on-line order forms may be transferred to in-store lease order forms to save you time. If you have selected a franchisee’s store as your preferred store, we will submit the on-line order form to that franchisee. Unless you have opted out of receiving marketing offers, we may also use your personal information to inform you of our other available products or services from us, our franchisees, or external business partners, primarily independent vendors with whom we do business, and from time to time to offer you contest entry forms. If you have not opted out of receiving marketing research surveys, we may also forward you surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

If at anytime you wish to withdraw your consent to receiving direct marketing communications or surveys from us, simply contact us in any of the ways described in the “Contact Information” section below, and we will remove your name and contact information from our promotional and survey mailing lists.

We do not sell, rent or lease our customer lists to third parties. We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of our franchisees or external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, as mentioned above, your unique personal information (e.g., e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the franchisees or external business partners. In addition, we may share data with third party service providers to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries or services calls. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to us, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as gender, race, religion, or political affiliations, without your express consent. 

Our Web Site has features that automatically keep track of the pages that you visit within our Web Site, in order to determine which of our Web Site’s services are the most popular. This data is used for us to deliver customized content and advertising to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. ****

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information, without notice, to a third party only if required to do so by law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served upon us; (b) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our Web Site, or the public; or (c) protect the health, life, or security of an individual. Where permitted by local law, we may also, without notice, report our experiences with you to credit bureaus, including in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar provincial consumer reporting legislation where applicable.   


**Use of Cookies** / **Automatic Data Collection**

Our Web Site uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize our web pages, or register with our Web Site, a cookie helps the Web Site recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Web Site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features on our Web Site that you have customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of our services or of the pages of our Web Site that you visit. 

**Security of your Personal Information**

We use commercially reasonable precautions to protect and secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to help protect customer information. Appropriate employees are authorized to access customer information for business purposes only. Our policies require employees to maintain the confidentiality of customer information and employees are subject to disciplinary action if they fail to do so, up to and including termination. Information secured on our computer system is in a controlled, secure environment, aimed at protecting it from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted via the internet, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. 

**Retention and Storage of Your Personal Information**

We retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws, and your consent to such purpose(s) remains valid after termination of your relationship with us.

For Canadian Residents: Your personal information may be processed and stored outside of the province in which you reside and/or outside of Canada by us, an affiliate or an unaffiliated service provider for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement and, under the laws of these other jurisdictions, in certain circumstances foreign courts, law enforcement agencies or regulatory agencies may be entitled to access your personal information. 

**Sale of Business**

We reserve the right to disclose or transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession), lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance or financing of all or any portion of our business, assets, or shares in order for you to continue to receive the same products and services from the third party. 

**Children**

Our Web Site is not directed at individuals less than eighteen years of age, and we do not intend to collect any personal information from such individuals. 

**Changes to this Statement**

This Privacy Statement replaces any previous privacy statements and notices from us about the privacy, security and protection of your information. You may have other privacy rights under local laws. We may amend this Privacy Statement at any time. We will inform you of any changes as required by law. 

**Updating Personal Information/Opt-Out**

If your personal information changes (such as address or telephone number), or if you no longer desire our products or services, please contact our store location at which you have done business. If you have only supplied your personal information on our Web Site, please contact us by any of the ways described in the “Contact Information” section below.
