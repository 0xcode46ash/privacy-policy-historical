Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address, mailing address, and phone number. Users may, however, visit our Website anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personal identification information, but it may prevent them from engaging in certain Website related activities or other Services.

Non-personal identification information may include, but is not limited to, the browser name, the type of computer, and the technical information about Users’ means of connection to our Website, such as the operating system, the Internet service providers utilized, and other similar information.

### Web browser cookies

Our Website may use "cookies" to enhance User experience. Users’ web browsers place cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them. Users may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies or to alert them when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that some parts of the Website may not function properly.

We may use email addresses to send Users information and updates pertaining to their order. It may also be used to respond to their inquiries, questions, and/or other requests. If Users decide to opt-in to our mailing list, they will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. If at any time the User would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

### How we protect your information

We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices, and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information, and data stored on our Website or Services.

Sensitive and private data exchanged between the Website and its Users happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.

### Disclosing your personal information

We do not sell, trade, or rent Users’ personal identification information to others.

Tradesy may disclose Users' personal information to the following parties and for the following purposes:

##### Sellers from whom you have purchased items

When you buy an item on Tradesy, if the seller does not elect to use her own shipping materials, the seller receives a Tradesy-branded shipping kit with a pre-paid, pre-addressed postage label with your full street address. The information will only include that which is necessary and relevant to successfully complete your order. The seller is strictly prohibited from using your information for anything other than completing the sale.

##### Business partners, trusted affiliates, and third party service providers

We may disclose generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates, and advertisers for the purposes outlined above, referenced above with respect to how Tradesy uses collected personal information, without notification to the User of disclosure. We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and our Website or administer activities on our behalf, such as sending newsletters or surveys. We may disclose your information to these third parties for those limited purposes provided that you have given us your explicit consent.

##### Law enforcement and government agencies

We may disclose User’s personal identification information to law enforcement and government agencies in response to a verified request related to suspected illegal activities or related to a criminal investigation. We will only disclose information that we find necessary and relevant. Disclosed information may include User’s name, mailing address, phone number, and email address. Disclosure may be made without notice to User.

##### Third Parties with intellectual property rights

We may disclose User’s personal identification information to third parties with intellectual property rights who have complied with Tradesy’s complaint procedure, as outlined in our Terms of Use Agreement. We will only disclose information found necessary and relevant in connection to an intellectual property infringement, fraud investigation, or other unlawful activity to which the third party has been subject, as detailed in our Verified Rights Owners Program. Disclosed personal identification information may include, but is not limited to, User’s name, mailing address, phone number, and email address. Disclosure may be made without notice to User.

For avoidance of doubt, please take note that disclosing personal identification information to third parties with intellectual property rights includes the disclosure of personal identification information of a User who has been identified as selling unauthorized goods or replica items, which is in violation of our Terms of Use.

##### Third parties in a legal proceeding

We may disclose User’s personal identification information to third parties involved in a legal proceeding if the third party provides Tradesy with a subpoena or other similar lawful process. Disclosure may be made without notice to User.

Tradesy will also disclose to third parties involved in a legal proceeding when Tradesy believes in good faith that disclosing personal identification information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or to report suspected illegal activity.

### Disclosure related to Tradesy’s Terms of Use Agreement

If Tradesy believes in good faith that User has breached the Terms of Use Agreement or any other Tradesy agreement, Tradesy may disclose such User’s personal identification information as found necessary and relevant to pursuing a claim or preventing further injury to Tradesy, its Users, and others. Disclosure may be made without notice to User.
