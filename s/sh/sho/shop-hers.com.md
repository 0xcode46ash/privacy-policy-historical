We may use the information Users provide to send information that Users agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to them. 

##### To send periodic emails

We may use email addresses to send Users information and updates pertaining to their order. It may also be used to respond to their inquiries, questions, and/or other requests. If Users agree to be on our mailing lists, they will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. If at any time the User would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email. You may not, however, unsubscribe from emails about your account status or order status. 

### How we protect your information

We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices, and security measures that are designed to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information, and data stored on our Website or Services. 

### Disclosing your personal information

We do not sell, trade, or rent Users’ personal identification information to others. 

Tradesy may disclose Users' personal identification information to the following parties and for the following purposes: 

##### Sellers from whom you have purchased items

When you buy an item on Tradesy, if the seller does not elect to use her own shipping materials, the seller receives a Tradesy-branded shipping kit with a pre-paid, pre-addressed postage label with your full street address. The information will only include that which is necessary and relevant to successfully complete your order. The seller is strictly prohibited from using your information for anything other than completing the sale. 

##### Business partners, trusted affiliates, and third party service providers

We may disclose generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates, and advertisers, without notification to the User of such disclosure. We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and our Website or administer activities on our behalf, such as sending newsletters or surveys. We may disclose your information, including your personal identification information, to these third parties only to the extent necessary for them to provide such services to us and such third party service providers are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that information. These third parties may be located outside of your country of residence. In this case, your personal information would be subject to the laws of the country to which it is transferred and stored, which may have laws that require that your personal information be disclosed to government agencies under different circumstances than would your country of residence. 

#####  Corporate Transactions 

In the event of a sale, amalgamation, re-organization, transfer or financing of parts of some or all of Tradesy’s business, your personal identification information may be disclosed to an acquiring organization either as part of due diligence or on completion of the transaction. If your personal identification information is ever disclosed in this context, Tradesy will require the acquiring organization to agree to protect your personal identification information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to only use your personal identification information for purposes relating to the transaction. 

##### Law enforcement and government agencies

We may disclose User’s personal identification information to law enforcement and government agencies in response to a verified request related to suspected illegal activities or related to a criminal investigation. We will only disclose information that we find necessary and relevant. Disclosed information may include User’s name, mailing address, phone number, and email address. Disclosure may be made without notice to User. 

##### Third Parties with intellectual property rights

We may disclose User’s personal identification information to third parties with intellectual property rights who have complied with Tradesy’s complaint procedure, as outlined in our Terms of Use Agreement. We will only disclose information found necessary and relevant in connection to an intellectual property infringement, fraud investigation, or other unlawful activity to which the third party has been subject, as detailed in our Verified Rights Owners Program. Disclosed personal identification information may include, but is not limited to, User’s name, mailing address, phone number, and email address. Disclosure may be made without notice to User. 

For avoidance of doubt, please take note that disclosing personal identification information to third parties with intellectual property rights includes the disclosure of personal identification information of a User who has been identified as selling unauthorized goods or replica items, which is in violation of our Terms of Use. 

##### Third parties in a legal proceeding

We may disclose User’s personal identification information to third parties involved in a legal proceeding if the third party provides Tradesy with a subpoena or other similar lawful process. Disclosure may be made without notice to User. 

Tradesy will also disclose to third parties involved in a legal proceeding when Tradesy believes in good faith that disclosing personal identification information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or to report suspected illegal activity. 

### Disclosure related to Tradesy’s Terms of Use Agreement

If Tradesy believes in good faith that User has breached the Terms of Use Agreement or any other Tradesy agreement, Tradesy may disclose such User’s personal identification information as found necessary and relevant to pursuing a claim or preventing further injury to Tradesy, its Users, and others. Disclosure may be made without notice to User.
