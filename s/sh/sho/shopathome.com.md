**What Information We Collect and Why**  
Our goal at ShopAtHome.com is to maximize the "Cash Back" rewards for our members and to provide them with as many benefits as possible. The primary way we do this is by utilizing the power of our consumer membership base to negotiate significant sales commissions from both well-known national retailers as well as specialty boutiques (our "Affiliate Merchants"). We then pass on as much of this commission to you, as a ShopAtHome.com member, in the form of real cash.   Consequently, when you first register with ShopAtHome.com, we ask you to provide your name, date of birth, street address, and E-mail address to determine your eligibility to be a member and to process your "Cash Back" rewards. We also ask for additional optional information on your interests, gender, and occupation. Based on this information, we can better determine what types of merchants and specials to pursue so that you will get the most out of your membership in ShopAtHome.com. However, you are under no obligation to provide us with this information-it is completely optional.   ShopAtHome.com may also collect certain information online deriving from your navigation of ShopAtHome.com and our Affiliate Merchants.  We collect this information to ensure that you receive your cash back rewards and to better understand what type of merchants and specials to pursue.   
We do collect information regarding other software that might be resident on your computer that may impact the correct functioning of the SOFTWARE.   ShopAtHome.com uses cookie technology to understand general information on site traffic trends such as most frequently visited pages or Affiliate Merchants. This information is captured on an aggregate basis, is not specific to individual users, and enables ShopAtHome.com to continually improve our Web site content and navigation.   The cookies also enable our Affiliate Merchants to recognize you as a ShopAtHome.com member so that they can accurately process Qualified Purchases. Since we need to be able to identify each individual user for accurate posting of ShopAtHomeSelect rebates and for the best matching of your interests with what our site has to offer, the information in cookies may also be captured on an individual basis. (Please refer to our Membership Agreement for a full definition of a "Qualified Purchase."). 

**How We Ensure the Security of Your Information**  
ShopAtHome.com has extensive security measures in place to protect the information within our control from loss, misuse or alteration. We have all appropriate industry standard procedures in place to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, such as firewall and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. However, no data transmitted over the Internet can be 100% secure. Consequently, while ShopAtHome.com makes every effort to protect your personal information, any information that you provide to ShopAtHome.com or its Affiliate Merchants is transmitted at your own risk. 

**With Whom We Share Your Information**   
Our primary use of your personal information is to process your Cash Back reward checks and to maintain your Member account. ShopAtHome.com may also store and use your personal information for our own internal mailing and database purposes.   The composite tracking information generated by cookies, as outlined above, may be shared with third parties for the purpose of documenting site activity and other trends.   In the course of our day-to-day business, we employ outside companies and individuals to perform functions for us, such as removing duplicate information from customer lists or providing database analysis. These vendors have access to the personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.   We share member information only with ShopAtHome.com's parent company, Belcaro Group, Inc. All E-mails distributed by Belcaro Group, ShopAtHome.com, or ShopAtHome.com have simple opt-out mechanisms should you decide you do not want to receive these offers from us. 

**Your privacy as related to our Affiliate Merchants**  
In order to grant your cash back rebate, our Affiliate Merchants pass back to us the amount of your order as well as your unique customer id. With these two pieces of information, we are able to make sure the right rebate goes to the right person.   ShopAtHome.com contains links to our Affiliate Merchants. Each of these merchants maintains its own privacy statement and we encourage you to read these individual policies. We cannot either enforce or monitor the Privacy Policies of Affiliate Merchants. This Privacy Commitment applies solely to information collected by ShopAtHome.com, on our site.   ShopAtHome.com does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of such third party Web sites including all framed sites. Moreover, ShopAtHome.com disclaims all responsibility for the subsequent use of an E-mail address or any other personally identifiable information you have provided to an Affiliate Merchant. 

**How you can change, correct and update your information**  
As a ShopAtHome.com member, you can change the information we have on file for you at any time, including your interest areas and what types of information you receive, simply by visiting the Edit My Preferences page and making your desired changes.   Upon enrollment, ShopAtHome.com members are opted-in to receive ShopAtHome.com and ShopAtHome.com newsletters and special E-mail promotions. On every one of these E-mails you are given the choice to unsubscribe from the mailing or you may opt out [here](http://discounts.shopathome.com/CustomerCare.asp). Please allow up to 7 business days to process your E-mail request or account changes. 

**Miscellaneous**  
As our company changes and grows, we might sell or buy companies, subsidiaries, or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that ShopAtHome.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your member information may be one of the transferred assets.   By enrolling in the ShopAtHome.com program, you agree that you have read, understand and agree with our Privacy Commitment, and the Membership Agreement, in its entirety, and consent to be bound by all said Terms and Conditions. You further acknowledge ShopAtHome.com's right to change this policy, without prior notification, and our commitment to post any such changes on this page so that you are fully informed. We encourage our members to check back from time to time, as your continued enrollment in the ShopAtHome.com program shall be deemed to be your acceptance of the modified terms.
