HealthWATCH Easy Refills™

All personal information provided as result of a prescription refill request is necessary to properly identify the prescription and the patient. Once a prescription refill request is received by a pharmacy, for the patient's health and safety and for the pharmacist to properly fulfill his/her professional responsibilities, it may be necessary for the pharmacy to contact the patient's physician (or the prescribing professional) to discuss the refill request, the patient's medication history and medical conditions.

The receipt of a refill request shall be deemed consent to such disclosure and use of the patient's personal information.

The patient's consent to this disclosure of personal health information to such health plan is deemed by the request for payment or reimbursement for the prescription to such health plan and/or the provision to the pharmacy of the details of the patient's health plan information.
