# Shoes, Fashion, Fitness: Contact Me/PR Friendly/Privacy Policy

Hello, my name is Jessica and blogging and writing is my passion. While I do love blogging about shoes, fashion, and fitness as my blog name would suggest, I like to blog about anything family friendly and do reviews of products I think should be shared!  
  
If you would like to contact me with questions, comments, suggestions you can do so on my Facebook page: [Shoes, Fashion, Fitness](http://www.facebook.com/ShoesFashionFitness).  
  
If you would like to contact me for any business purposes please email me at jessica@shoesfashionfitness.com. I love to review products and would love to find some Sponsors or work with your company.   
  
If you would like me to review something, I am not responsible for shipping costs and all I ask is for a full size product, in exchange for a fair, unbiased and honest review. I will not review samples, it's too difficult to get a good feel of the product. I will review your products within 1month, however most times I will have it done in 2weeks. Once it is finished, I will promote it using all social media sites I currently use. I would be more then happy to host a giveaway if you would like to sponsor one too. I also do paid posts, we can discuss payment.  
  
I am always looking for sponsors, the cost can be discussed, and would include a 250x250 ad, and a weekly twitter and facebook shoutout.  
  
If I am hosting a sponsored giveaway I am not responsible for shipping prizes.  It is up to the sponsor to ensure that you receive your prize.
