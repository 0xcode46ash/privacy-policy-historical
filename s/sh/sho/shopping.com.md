**What Information Does AltaVista Collect From You?** |    
 |   


  * You can visit our site and use many of our services without having to tell us who you are or reveal any personally identifiable information to us. It is only when, use certain AltaVista services, or enter contests, that you will be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information. 
  * Whenever you visit AltaVista, our web server logs automatically receive and record anonymous information from your web browser including your IP Address, AltaVista cookie information, the AltaVista page(s) you request, and any search terms you query. 
  * AltaVista uses this anonymous information to customize your experience on our site, to improve our services, and to show you more relevant advertising messages. We ordinarily do not attempt to link this information to a specific person, with certain important exceptions. 
  * AltaVista uses personally identifiable information for three main purposes: to fulfill your requests for certain services, to personalize the advertising and content you see on our pages, and to tell you about special offers and new products and services.

**Do Any Third Parties Receive or Collect Your Information Through AltaVista?** |

  * AltaVista will not share personally identifiable information with other companies or individuals unless: 
    * We have your express permission to share the information; 
    * We need to share your information with our partner companies in order to provide a product or service you have requested. Unless we tell you otherwise, these partners do not have the right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to deliver your requested product or service; or 
    * We comply with subpoenas or court orders.
  * Except as we've just explained above, AltaVista will not sell or disclose your personally identifiable information to anyone. Nor will we ever share with anyone personally identifiable information about you that is of medical, financial or sexual nature. 
  * AltaVista shares some of the anonymous information we collect with Engage. In addition, we allow both Engage and DoubleClick to set and access cookies on your computer. 
  * AltaVista does not provide either Engage nor DoubleClick, or any other advertiser or advertising service provider, any personally identifiable information. However, certain ads you see on our site may allow personally identifiable information to be collected (such as sweepstakes that allow you to enter the contest without ever clicking to a new site). Such information is never shared with AltaVista.
