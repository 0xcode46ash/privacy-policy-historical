Justice collects various types of personal information about you during the course of our customer relationship. Justice does not require anyone to share any personal information about themselves in order to enjoy our website or purchase items in our stores. However, our site may contain special sections and privileges for members that register. In addition, we do require a parent or legal guardian to have a registered account in order for their child to become a Justice E-mail member. We do this to ensure that you as the parent have the ability to delete, modify or refuse access to your child.s information. Details on the information we ask for at registration, as well as any other rules or restrictions, are made available at registration areas.

We do not collect any personal information online unless it is voluntarily provided, for instance when registering, participating in contests, sweepstakes, promotions, completing online surveys, creating a wish list and emailing it to a friend, or purchasing products from our online store. 

We also collect information from you offline if, for example, you request a copy of our catazine, participate in a sweepstakes or purchase products from one of our stores.

E-mail addresses are used only for purposes of forwarding the Wish List to the intended recipients, and do not involve the collection of, or sharing of, any personal information. When a customer places an order online, we collect information associated with the requested transaction, such as the customer's name, mailing address, products ordered, shipping addresses, email address, and credit card information. We ask for this information so that we may fulfill the order.

This information helps Justice create a better web site by revealing which feature is a success and identifying areas that might need improvement.

For administrative purposes, each visitor's IP address is also collected. An IP address is the automatic number assigned to each user's computer when that person surfs the web.

Because these uses of your personal information do not involve sending you promotional materials, your opt-outs under 7 below will not apply to any of these operational uses.

In those cases, we will share the information necessary to carry out your request. 

Justice may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating for example your age and gender or similar information with information about other individuals), and/or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable directly to you. _Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon the right of Justice to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information and Justice may use, sell and/or share such non-personally identifiable information with any outside third parties_.

For full terms and conditions regarding User Submissions you submit to the Sites, please review our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/customerService/Ordering_Online#content_7). 

**6.       Information We Receive from Third Parties.**

We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you are on another web site and you opt-in to receive information from Justice, that web site will forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third party web site) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected.

In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections’” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service.

**Children's Online Privacy Policy**   
Effective as of October 6, 2010. 

Dear Justice Parent, 

The Internet provides Justice an opportunity to reach tween girls in new and exciting ways with information about our clothes, sweepstakes, surveys, email and other forms of interactivity. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, store, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age; and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Web sites, and to provide parents the right to refuse the use of and to require modification or deletion of their child’s information. Also, when we use the term "parent" below, we mean to include legal guardians.

The following is a supplement to our Privacy Policy. If you wish to read our Privacy Policy, [click here](https://web.archive.org/customerService/Safety_Security_and_Privacy#content_1).

We may collect a child's personally identifiable information (including first name, last name, birth date, and e-mail address) for such activities as joining Justice E-mail, receiving promotional offers and emails, participating in product reviews, or surveys, providing a wish list and emailing it to friends or family, participating in or receiving a prize in sweepstakes, contests, or games, requests for suggestions, or regarding products or services, or requests for additional information that may assist us in offering the best service. In these instances we will initially collect only the child's name, birth date, and online contact information and the e-mail address of the child's parent. Unless otherwise expressly provided, any email address submitted through the Wish List is not retained by Justice.

  * Justice, like all website operators, is prohibited by law from conditioning a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.
  * We may collect a child's name and e-mail address to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security of this web site, to protect against liability or as required or permitted by law. Information collected for these reasons will not be used for any other purpose.



**2\. Disclosure of Children's Personal Information with Third Parties.**

  * Justice does not release a child's personal information with third parties unless the disclosure is reasonable necessary to comply with law, respond to civil or criminal action, or to protect the security of our web site.

All contracted companies are contractually bound to maintain the confidentiality and security of all customer information.



**3\. Parental Consent to Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information.**

  * Before using a child's personal information for any purpose, we will send the parent an e-mail that (a) informs the parent that we wish to collect and use the child's personal information and request the parent's consent to do so, and (b) provides the parent with a link to access to this Privacy Policy, which describes our information collection and use policies as required by COPPA. Justice will ask the parent to provide consent at our Web site. Upon receipt of the consent, we will send the parent a confirming e-mail. If parental consent is not obtained within fourteen (14) calendar days, any personal information collected online by Justice will be deleted from its records. In addition, Justice provides parents the option to revoke a prior consent at any time.



**4\. Parental Review and Making Changes to Personally Identifiable Information Collected From Children Under 13.**

(ii.) sending a written request via email to: [justice@tweenbrands.com](mailto:justice@tweenbrands.com) writing "Justice Privacy Policy" in the subject line;

(iv.) telephone 1-866-246-5822 and press the Customer Service option key to leave a message;
