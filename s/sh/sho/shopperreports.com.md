# ShopperReports.com - Privacy Statement

**_SHOPPERREPORTS PRIVACY POLICY_**

This Privacy Policy covers the use of the website [www.shopperreports.com](http://www.shopperreports.com/) and the ShopperReports software and comparative service (collectively: "ShopperReports").

At ShopperReports, we’re committed to your privacy. Our Privacy Policy is simple: **What do we do?**

•    When you visit a shopping or travel website, the ShopperReports software connects to our servers to check for product and travel information, better prices and alternative offers for the product or travel deal you were interested in, in order to present them to you. For that end, the software transmits to our servers only the URL of the e-commerce or travel site you are visiting or the search term you typed in search engines.

•    We offer you comparative product and travel deals, as well as additional product and travel information, from the most trusted vendors on the net.

**What we don't do:**

•    We do **not** collect any personally identifiable information ("PII") about you.

•    We do **not** trade, rent or sell PII to third parties.

•    We do **not** transmit to our servers any information about your searches or website visits, except for information about visits to e-commerce sites or searches performed on such sites or in search engines. When such information is transmitted to our servers, it is processed only for the purpose of performing the comparative service and **nothing** else is being done with it.

•    We do **not** display popups on your computer. 

**Learn more about safe surfing** and online shopping from the [Federal Trade Commission](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee.htm). 

_(a) Anonymous Aggregate Information_

ShopperReports collects and stores aggregated anonymous information about the       e-commerce or travel web pages its users view and the data they enter in search engine search fields while using the ShopperReports software (the “Service”).  ShopperReports uses this information to determine which alternative offers to display on your browser window pane.  

The ShopperReports software does **not** send to our servers any information about the web pages you view, unless you are visiting one of the e-commerce or travel sites that we have examined and catalogued. For every such e-commerce or travel web page you view while using the Service, the ShopperReports software transmits from your computer to the ShopperReports server and stores the following information: your Internet Protocol (IP) Address; the Full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the web page you are visiting; general information about your browser and your computer's operating system; your ShopperReports cookie number and the date and time the above information is logged.  We also collect and store the following ShopperReports usage statistics: what is clicked on the browser window pane; the amount of time the Service is used during each session; which keyword searches are performed and what alternative results are received during any given session.

If you are only visiting our site ([www.ShopperReports.com](http://www.shopperreports.com/)), we collect the following information: the URL of the web page from which you came; the date and time of each page you view; the name of and information about any advertisement that brought you to our web site; and computer and connection information.  If the URL of the page from which you came contains any PII about you, we will not attempt to determine your identity by analyzing the URL in any way. Also the IP address of the computer from which you arrived to our site is recorded by the web server; this is an automated information collection as done by any web server, and we do not store this information for further use. 

_(b) Personally Identifiable Information_

Currently there is no personal registration on our site. In the future we may add services that can ask for your registration.  In these cases, Registration will be optional and you may choose to use the ShopperReports program without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself.  If you choose to register, ShopperReports will ask you for some PII (for example your name, email address, and a city or an airport near you) in order to create an account. 

If you contact us through the "Partner with us" or "contact us" pages, you are required to provide your e-mail address and, optionally, name and phone number, so that we may be able to respond to your inquiry.  In any event, this PII is not used in any manner other than to contact you regarding your inquiry. 

Any PII which would be gathered, as described above, is stored separately from the information about the web pages you view and the data you enter in search engine search fields and the two types of information are not correlated or linked. 

Except for the specific cases described above, we do not gather PII from you without your specific permission when you visit the ShopperReports site and download the ShopperReports software or use the Service.
