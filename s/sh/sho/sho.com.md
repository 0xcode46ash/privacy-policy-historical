**SHO.COM PRIVACY POLICY**

SHO.COM is committed to protecting the privacy of its visitors and has prepared the following statement to inform users how personally identifying information and non-personally identifying information is gathered from our website and used by SHO.COM. SHO.COM encourages its website users to be smart about choosing when, and to whom, to release information online. This policy may be updated from time to time, so please check back periodically. We will notify you of significant changes by prominently posting them at our site, or by sending an e-mail to the primary address specified in your account. Please note that SHO.COM is intended for use by United States residents only and, therefore, SHO.COM's Privacy Policy is specifically directed only towards residents of the United States. 

NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION   
Certain non-personally identifiable information about our visitors is collected by the standard operation of SHO.COM's internet servers and through the use of "cookie" technology (as described below), such as the type of internet browser you are using and the domain name of your internet service provider, where you go within the site, how much time you spend in any particular area and what you buy. 

COOKIES   
A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sites on SHO.COM where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable by you require that you accept cookies. Generally, we use cookies to: 

  1. Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In" and is modified when you "Sign Out" of our services. SHO.COM also uses cookies to store your zip code for other services, such as facilitating your subscribing to Showtime via the website. 
  2. Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing SHO.COM is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior. 
  3. Assist us in tracking visits to and business at our store, and to process the items in your shopping basket. This information collected by cookies is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail" and may also describe which pages you have seen in each part of the store. 
  4. Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a SHO.COM-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings. 
  5. Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of the SHO.COM web site you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on SHO.COM a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites. 



Advertisers that serve ads onto SHO.COM may also use their own cookies.   
You have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those SHO.COM services that require registration in order to participate. These services include (but are not limited to): e-mail schedule reminders, subscribing to Showtime via the website, participating in any loyalty or incentive programs and customizing your home page. 

Information collected by the standard operation of SHO.COM's internet servers and through the use of cookies is analyzed by SHO.COM only in aggregate form and is used to improve the content of our website, to tailor the content and/or layout to consumer trends and to notify users about updates to the site. SHO.COM reserves the right to disclose or otherwise utilize this information in aggregate form, for any purpose, in its sole judgment. 

Log data collected on web servers both within SHO.COM's control and under the confidential control of SHO.COM's third party ad service provider(s) supplies SHO.COM with aggregate information about the number of visits to different pages on our site. This information is not personally identifiable information and is used by SHO.COM to improve the content of our website. 

PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION   
SHO.COM also gathers personally identifiable information (such as your name, street address, telephone number and e-mail address) from voluntary submissions as part of site registration, sweepstakes, contests, and other online promotions, when you place an order for merchandise, complete a survey that we use for research purposes, or when you report a problem with our site or one of our services. Also, if you contact Showtime Online, we may keep a record of that correspondence. Such information is only known to SHO.COM when it is voluntarily submitted or posted to us. Wherever SHO.COM collects personally identifiable information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. 

Personally identifiable information will be used by SHO.COM (1) to process your requests (e.g., register you for a contest or sweepstakes or fulfill your merchandise order); (2) to communicate with you or personalize the site based on your stated interests and preferences or make related offers to you; (3) to administer the site or serve you when you have questions or problems; and/or (4) as may, in SHO.COM's sole judgment, be required by any applicable laws, rules or regulations or the Terms and Conditions applicable to this website. 

Personally identifiable information will be shared with third parties to further the purpose for which you provide such information (e.g., to process your subscription request or merchandise order) or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or property of SHO.COM or its affiliates or subscribers or to comply with legal or regulatory obligations. In addition, we may transfer information to a third party in the event of corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets).

If SHO.COM intends to disclose personally identifiable information to third parties in circumstances not outlined above, you will be advised at the time that we request that you provide us such information, such as in the rules of a sweepstakes or contest or as part of the terms of a given promotion, and you will be provided with the opportunity to opt out of our online database so that participation in the registration, sweepstakes, contest or other activity is possible without disclosing personally identifiable information to such third parties (except that personally identifiable information shall be forwarded to third party providers of gifts, prizes and/or awards). SHO.COM does not currently sell any personally identifiable information to third parties.

In an effort to further protect your privacy, at any time you can request that we remove you from our databases. To remove your name from SHO.COM's online databases, click the 'Edit Profile' link on SHO.com and select the 'Delete Account' option. It will take us at least forty-eight (48) hours to process such requests. Please note that we may need to maintain certain personal information that you have provided to comply with legal or business requirements or as part of the historical record.

ADVERTISING   
SHO.COM uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [**click here**](http://www.doubleclick.com/naiprivacy/).

SHOPPING SERVICES  
SHO.COM strives to offer its visitors a secure and safe environment for credit card purchases. The shopping and fulfillment services offered on SHO.COM are operated by SHO.COM's third party shopping partner, Robertson Marketing Group, Inc., not SHO.COM. Our shopping partner is equally concerned about your privacy. It collects personally identifiable information necessary to accept, process and ship your ordered merchandise on behalf of SHO.COM, to provide you with information you may request and updates on the status of your order, and to assist your purchasing experience. Our shopping partner collects personally identifiable information from you by "active" means, whereby you actively give our shopping partner, as SHO.COM's agents, that information when ordering merchandise. 

Personally identifiable information entered into any of the SHO.COM shopping services is used to complete your transaction and not revealed to others or used by our shopping partner for any purpose not authorized by SHO.COM. Our shopping partner does not own the personally identifiable information it collects and is only authorized to routinely provide such information to SHO.COM (or its designee) and to the delivery services (e.g., the U.S. Postal Service and UPS) it uses to deliver merchandise that you order from the SHO.COM shopping services. However, as authorized by SHO.COM, our shopping partner will provide personally identifiable information in response to legitimate subpoenas or other appropriate law enforcement activities. 

Credit card information provided to buy merchandise is used solely to determine that your card is valid, that sufficient credit is available to pay for the purchase and to apply the cost of your purchase to your card when the items are shipped. Credit card information you provide is transmitted across the Internet securely using encryption from your browser to our shopping partner's secure order processing systems. Some versions of browsers and firewalls do not permit connection to secure servers. In such cases, you will not be able to connect to the server and therefore won't be able to place an order through a secure connection. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, our shopping partner cannot entirely ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to them. 

Use of cookies by our shopping partner is limited to 'session' cookies. These cookies are active only while you are connected to the shopping cart site, which means that when you close your browser window after a shopping session, the cookie is deleted. Our shopping partner is not authorized by us to store cookies on your computer. 

OTHER CREDIT CARD PURCHASES   
In the event SHO.COM collects credit card information in other areas on SHO.COM other than the SHO.COM store, SHO.COM uses select software to provide security for transactions including those involving credit cards. As such, we attempt to make shopping online easy and safe within the website. SHO.COM may make use of information collected during the transaction process to make other marketing offers to you, unless you specifically tell us not to. 

SHO.COM's other authorized merchants and fulfillment providers will be encouraged to abide by SHO.COM's privacy policy when handling any personally identifiable information given to them on account of purchases made through our website. 

Please be aware that SHO.COM advertisers or web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those web sites linked to SHO.COM are not covered by this privacy policy. 

SECURITY   
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, SHO.COM cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we use reasonable efforts to ensure that collected personally identifiable information is secure and not readily accessible to unapproved individuals or third parties. SHO.COM has limited the number of people who have physical access to our database servers and has implemented electronic security systems and password protections which help further guard against unauthorized access. 

CHILDREN   
SHO.COM is sensitive to parents' concerns about the collection of personally identifiable information about their children. As such, SHO.COM will not collect information concerning children age 12 and under. SHO.COM also encourages teenagers age 13-17 to consult with their parents or guardians before furnishing any information to SHO.COM or other websites. 

While SHO.COM encourages children to consult their parents before furnishing data, parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address or other personally identifiable information without parental permission. 

CONTACT INFORMATION   
If you have any questions, comments or concerns regarding SHO.COM's privacy policy and/or practices, please visit [www.sho.com/contact](http://www.sho.com/site/util/contact.do) or write us at Showtime Networks Inc., 1633 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 ATTN: Legal Department. This policy, like the online medium itself, is subject to change and, as such, we encourage you to review this policy from time to time.
