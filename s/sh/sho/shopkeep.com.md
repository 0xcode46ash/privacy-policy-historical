## Overview

Protecting your privacy is very important to Shopkeep. We designed this Privacy Policy to make clear to you how we may collect, use and share your personal information. “Personal information” means any information that can be used to personally identify you. This does not include any information that has been aggregated or made anonymous. Please read this policy carefully in order to understand what we do with your information.

SHOPKEEP MAKES NOT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WITH RESPECT TO ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PAID FOR USING THE SHOPKEEP PLATFORM OR PURCHASED FROM SHOPKEEP AFFILIATED MERCHANTS.

## The Information Shopkeep Collects

User Provided Information: When you sign up with a Shopkeep affiliated merchant, the merchant will collect the personal information you volunteer, for example, your name, your address and your email address. When your payment to the merchant is processed, we only receive the last 4 digits of your payment credit card number or payment identification number. Your credit card number is otherwise encrypted by the swipe hardware used by the Shopkeep merchant and processed automatically. Shopkeep stores the information it receives about you in the portion of its database associated with the Shopkeep affiliated merchant that collected it.

Shopkeep will keep records of your transaction history and some information about your computer or the device you use to interoperate with the Shopkeep merchants that you frequent.

Automatically Collected Information: We may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), a unique device or user ID, version of software installed, system type, the dates, times and details of your transactions, and information from your account that you make publicly available.

Cookies Information: In order to enhance the Services can offer you, we may send one or more cookies – small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer.
