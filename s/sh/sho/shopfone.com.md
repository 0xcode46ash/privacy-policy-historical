Privacy Policy

AOL is committed to protecting its members' privacy and securely stores any information we may have about you. In addition to AOL's Privacy Policy, the following explains how AOL collects, stores, and uses information you provide through your use of the AOLbyPhone service: 

One feature of AOLbyPhone allows you to check your AOL e-mail by having our computer system read your e-mail aloud to you. No person reads, reviews, opens or otherwise monitors your e-mail. The process is entirely automated. 

In addition to the account number, password and other information you provide at registration, AOL's system automatically gathers information about which features of the AOLbyPhone service you use and how often you use them ("General Usage Information"). We may use General Usage Information to help personalize the AOLbyPhone service and enhance the speed at which you can access its features. For example, if you consistently use a certain feature of the service, we may use General Usage Information to shorten or customize the voice menu to reflect your familiarity with the service. Additionally, AOL may use General Usage Information to alert you to other features of the AOLbyPhone service. AOL may also use aggregate data based on our members' General Usage Information in order to determine how our members use different parts of the service and to improve the features and functionality of AOLbyPhone. AOL will not use General Usage Information for any other purpose other than to improve your experience on the AOLbyPhone service. 

AOL may use your AOLbyPhone registration data to update our records concerning your AOL membership. We may use this registration data, as well as data about the kinds of products you buy from AOL or how frequently you use the service, to extend special marketing offers to you. However, as described in the main AOL privacy policy, you may choose not to receive these marketing offers. Finally, AOL may use other information you have voluntarily provided on other AOL services to help personalize your use of AOLbyPhone (for example, stock portfolios you establish on AOL or my.aol.com). 

The telephone carrier you use to call the AOLbyPhone service, or another third party such as the manufacturer of your phone, may provide AOL with the phone number from which you are calling (unless you have instructed the carrier to block caller ID) and certain additional information, such as the location from which you are calling. AOL may use this information on a temporary basis during your session to personalize your AOLbyPhone experience, including, for example, to help deliver the local weather to you or to provide you advertisements about local products and services. AOL does not, however, store information provided by the telephone carrier. 

AOL uses state-of-the-art technology to keep your individual information as secure as possible. AOL also has put in place privacy protection control systems designed to keep your personal data safe and private. Be aware, however, that if you call the AOLbyPhone service from a wireless phone, the call runs the same risk of being intercepted as with any wireless service. Similarly, when speaking on a phone in a public area, you should be aware that others might overhear information relating to your account login and PIN number. You should exercise appropriate care to protect this information, or use the keyboard features. 

AOL will not share information you provide during registration or General Usage Information with third parties, except that AOL may share such information with partners who are working with AOL if doing so is necessary to provide the content or features of the service, or is necessary to complete a transaction you have requested. AOL may, however, release specific information about your account to comply with valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, on in special cases such as a physical threat to you or others. 

In the future, the AOLbyPhone service may provide a calling service feature that will allow you to make short telephone calls in connection with your use of AOLbyPhone. For example, if you go to the Restaurant Guides area and find a restaurant at which you would like to make a reservation, you might be able to ask the AOLbyPhone service to initiate a call to that restaurant. After finishing the call, you would be able to return to the AOLbyPhone service by keying in "**" on your touchtone pad. AOL will not intercept, monitor, or record the contents of any telephone call made using the AOLbyPhone service, though it may keep a record of the telephone number or identity of the establishment you called through the service. The telephony service for this feature is provided by a third-party. 

If the privacy policy for the AOLbyPhone service changes, we will post those changes at keyword "AOLbyPhone" so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
