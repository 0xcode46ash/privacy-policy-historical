    <h2>Our Commitment To Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice
      explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way
      your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it
      available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information
      may be requested.
    </p>
    <h3>1. The Information We Collect:</h3>

      <li>Address</li>
      <li>Email address</li>

    </ul>
    <p>

    </ul>
    <h3>2. The Way We Use Information:</h3>
    <p>
      We use the information you provide about yourself when scheduling a showing and share this
      information only with the party that has published the listing through our site. This party
      has, in accordance with our Terms of Use, agreed to use this information only for the purposes
      of scheduling and obtaining feedback on the listing you have elected to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      For account holders, we use your personal information only for the purposes of (1) contacting
      you regarding the ShowMojo service, and (2) processing subscription fees. We do not share this
      information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
    </p>
    <p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive.  Such addresses are not used for
      any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
    </p>
    <p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share
      with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited
      a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our
      registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those
      individuals.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Our Commitment To Data Security</h3>
    <p>
      To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of

      to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</h3>
    <p>
      Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.  For that reason, we never
      collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and
      no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
    </p>
    <h3>5. How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</h3>
    <p>
      You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a
      request that credibly shows error.
    </p>
    <p>
      To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity
      before granting access or making corrections.
