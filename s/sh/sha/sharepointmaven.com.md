## Our Marketing Mailings and How to Opt-Out

__We operate an email marketing program, used to inform subscribers about products and services supplied by us. Users may opt in to receiving such information via a registration form.

Email marketing campaigns published by us may contain tracking facilities within the actual email. Subscriber activity is tracked and stored in a database for future analysis and evaluation.

## Do Not Track (DNT) Disclosure

__Please note that while you may have the opportunity to opt-out of targeted advertising as discussed in the “How to Opt-Out” section above, and you may be able to control the use of cookies through your Web browser as described in the “Use of Cookies” section below, some Web browsers may also give you the ability to enable a “do not track” setting. This setting sends a special signal to the Web sites you encounter while Web browsing. This “do not track” signal is different from disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as browsers with the “do not track” setting enabled still have the ability to accept cookies. We do not respond to Web browser “do not track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.

## Privacy Protection for Children Using the Internet

Protecting children’s privacy is important to us. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information of those persons we actually know are under the age of thirteen (13) nor is any part of the Web site or the Services targeted to attract anyone under the age of thirteen (13). We request that all users of the Web site and the Services who are under the age of thirteen (13) not disclose or provide any personally-identifiable information. If we discover that a child under thirteen (13) has provided us with personally-identifiable information, we will delete that child’s personally-identifiable information from our records.

## Notice to Minors

In addition to protecting the privacy of children under age (13) we are committed to protect the privacy of minors.

Although we offer deletion capability for our Web site and Services, you should be aware that the removal of content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information posted through the Web site or Services.

## Data Security

We take reasonable steps to maintain the security of the personally-identifiable information that we collect, including limiting access to your personally-identifiable information to management only; however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Thus, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, so you do so at your own risk. Please note that non-encrypted communication using email is not secure. Thus, we cannot guarantee data security in email communication and, therefore, recommend using physical mail for confidential information.
