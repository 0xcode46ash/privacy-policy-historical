## Privacy Policy

Blogtronix LLC is absolutely committed to your privacy in any aspect and guards your personal and business information to the best of our capabilities. We know and see that the great and exciting growth of the Internet and all the types of online services has also brought reasonable concern for consumers about what information is collected, distributed and available about them, and we want you to be sure that we always consider and work with that diligent and honest commitment to all of our Internet activities.

We have taken, take and will take all the appropriate steps to protect your privacy while you are with us online. Whenever you provide personal or business sensitive information - demographic information, personal details, a credit card number to make a purchase, we always take reasonable steps to protect it, such as encrypting this information. We also take reasonable security measures to protect your personal and business information in storage.

We do not and will not provide any of your personal or business information to other companies or individuals without your specific request and permission. It is possible though that we may need to provide your name and delivery address to third parties that Blogtronix LLC uses for delivering specific services to you - like shipping companies if you have asked us to send something to you.
