#####  Use of Cookies 

The SharpSpring website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. In addition, you enable SharpSpring to obtain any other cookies used on your website in conjunction with the SharpSpring service. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize SharpSpring pages, or register with SharpSpring site or services, a cookie helps SharpSpring to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same SharpSpring website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the SharpSpring features that you customized.

#####  Security of your Personal Information 

SharpSpring secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We routinely scan our source code to check for weaknesses or vulnerabilities.
