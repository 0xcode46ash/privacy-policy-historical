Again, if you are concerned about attempts to match your IP address to your identity, you may wish to use an anonymous browsing service or attempt some means to obfuscate your real IP address.

Our policy is to only release the data we collect in the following circumstances:

* As required by law, such as in response to a valid request from law enforcement.  
* To designated third parties to resolve or investigate abuse complaints.  
* When the information is related to spiders or bots, usually when investigating technical issues.  
* For abusive users, we may release information to assist in attempting to block the abusive user or to complain to that user’s Internet Service Provider.  
* If necessary to defend legal claims against us by third parties.  
* When we deem it necessary to protect the property or rights of the user community, or this website.
