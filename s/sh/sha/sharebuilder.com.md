# ShareBuilder from Capital One

To learn how we collect, share and protect your information after you’ve applied for or obtained a consumer product or service from us, please download our [Privacy Policy](https://content.sharebuilder.com/mgdcon/core/agreements/CapitalOnePrivacyPolicy.pdf).

When we refer to "Contact Information" we mean your name, address, telephone number, employment status, fax number and email address. "Personal Nonpublic Information" refers to personally identifiable information about you and transactions in your account, including your Social Security number, account numbers, and information about your assets, accounts, transactions and tax status.

## Cookies

#### How ShareBuilder Uses Cookies

"Cookies" are bite sized pieces of data that a website can send to your browser and store on your computer. Our cookies don’t collect or contain personal information about you or compromise the confidentiality of your personal information.

Our system automatically gathers information about the areas you visit on our sites and about the links you may select from within our site to other areas of the Internet or elsewhere online. We use this information to understand how our users as a group use the services and resources on our sites. This way we know which areas of our sites are favorites of our users, which areas need improvement, and what technologies are being used so that we can continually improve our sites. We link this usage information to Contact Information or Personal Nonpublic Information in order to securely verify your identity, to personalize aspects of your experience on our web sites, to better understand which information or services are of greater value to our customers, and to send follow-up communications regarding our products and services to website visitors.

We may share aggregated statistical information with our partners, suppliers and other third parties, but we won’t share any names, individual navigation or other personal information.

#### Don't like cookies?

You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. You can also erase cookies already stored on your computer. If you choose not to accept cookies or if you erase them, our site (along with many others) and its features may not work as intended. For more information on working with cookies, you should consult the User Manual, FAQ or Help function of your specific browser and operating system software.

#### Third Party Cookies

While you’re browsing our web sites, you might be directed to web sites operated by third parties. These other web sites may send their own cookies to you and collect data or solicit personal information. We don’t control and are not responsible for what third parties do on their separate web sites, or how they handle information about you.

ShareBuilder works with some third parties that use their own cookies:

**Omniture** is a company we use to track and analyze the use of our site. ShareBuilder records user sessions and stores aggregated technical and navigational data. The recorded sessions are used to service and maintain accounts, and respond to customer inquiries. ShareBuilder owns this recorded and aggregated data and will not share personal non-public information with third parties. The aggregated data is analyzed by ShareBuilder and the results are used to improve web site design and functionality in order to deliver better products and services.

Although ShareBuilder doesn’t allow Omniture to capture or transmit any detailed transactional information, banking information, credit card information or other personal financial information, the data collected does include the nature of the service used (for example, whether you placed a trade, but not details about the trade), your email address and a unique customer identifier that ShareBuilder (not Omniture) can use to associate the data collected with individual customers.

[Click here](http://data.sharebuilder.com/optout.html) if you’d like to deactivate our ability to analyze your browsing behavior through the use of Omniture's web analytics services.

**Third-Party Advertising Companies** may serve ads on our behalf. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) is completely anonymous. If you’d like more information about this practice and your opt out choices, [click here.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices)

## Security

ShareBuilder takes the security of information very seriously and has established security standards and procedures to prevent unauthorized access to customer information. We use industry standard means such as physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, including data encryption and secure socket layer technology. We update and test our technology regularly to maintain and improve the protection of our customers' information. We restrict access to personal information to employees and service providers for legitimate business purposes to assist in providing services to you. Employees who violate our privacy policy are subject to disciplinary action.
