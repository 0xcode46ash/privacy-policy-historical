# The Sharper Image - Privacy and Legal Policy

  
**The Sharper Image Privacy Policy**

This is the Web site of Sharper Image Corporation  
Our postal address is:  
**650 Davis St.  
San Francisco, CA, 94111**  
We can be reached via [**care@sharperimage.com**](mailto:care@sharperimage.com). Or you can reach us by telephone at **1-800-344-5555** , our customer service line. 

**Data Collection**   
In several areas of our site, we ask you to provide information by filling out and submitting an online form. These areas include: 

  * Checkout, where we ask for name, address, email, credit card and other information needed to complete your order 
  * Catalog requests, where we ask for a name, postal address and email address 
  * Email Registration, where we ask for email address, first and last name and zip code 
  * Registration where we give you the option of saving your credit card information for faster online ordering. You also have the opportunity to save up to 99 ship-to addresses for gift giving purposes. 

Once you've registered, you may click on Account Info (at the top of any page) to edit or delete your personal information. All information relating to our customers is stored in a secure environment separate from our Web site. 

Currently, our third-party partner for data analytics is Coremetrics, a widely used service to online retailers. They automatically collect and aggregate non-personally identifying data on how shoppers use our Website; and they provide analysis on how we might improve our customers' shopping experience. For complete information (including how to opt out of participating), please go to [www.coremetrics.com](http://www.coremetrics.com/) and click on "Coremetrics is committed to privacy". 

**Data Use**   
The information we collect is used to improve our Web site, to notify consumers about updates to our Web site and for special offers and promotions. Also, sharperimage.com may provide aggregate statistics about our online sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these general statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

**Mailing Lists**  
We occasionally share our customer postal mailing list with select companies that might interest you. If you prefer that we not share your name, please click [here](mailto:removesharing@sharperimage.com?Subject=Remove%20from%20Sharing%20List) to send us an email to be removed from the list.  
Additionally, if you do not want to receive our catalog, please click [here](mailto:removecatalog@sharperimage.com?Subject=Remove%20from%20Catalog%20Mailing%20List) to send us an email to be removed from the list.

**Third Party**   
As a strict policy, sharperimage.com does not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share your email address with any other company or third party. From time to time we make portions of our customer postal mailing lists available to carefully screened companies. This may include your name and postal address, but never your email address. You can change your preferences at anytime by accessing the Account Info section of the Web site with your email account and password. 

If you supply us with your postal address online, you will only receive the information for which you provided us your address. By purchasing online, you are automatically added to our catalog mailing list. You may also receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. 

**"Cookie" Use**   
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide features such as welcoming you back to our site using your name and storing items in your shopping cart between visits. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features in our store, including placing items in your shopping cart and purchasing them.
