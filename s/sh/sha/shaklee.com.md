**Cookies**  
Some Shaklee Websites deposit certain bits of information called "cookies" in a visitor's web browser software. Cookies are sent back only to the Shaklee Websites that deposited them when a visitor returns to that site. Cookies can tell us how and when pages in a Shaklee Website are visited and by how many people. Cookies are not used to store personal information, such as social security and credit card numbers. Shaklee uses cookies:

  * To keep track of your shopping cart status;

We make public forums, such as chat rooms, message boards, and/or news groups ("Public Forums"), available to distributors. Please exercise appropriate caution in disclosing personal information in Public Forums since information disclosed in these areas becomes public information. The privacy provisions herein shall not apply to any personal information submitted via any of the Public Forums.

**Security**  
We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information you provide. When you place an order or give us personal information, such as name, address, telephone numbers, credit card or social security number, you are automatically on our secure server. Our secure server software encrypts the information you input before it is sent to us to protect your data against unauthorized access.
