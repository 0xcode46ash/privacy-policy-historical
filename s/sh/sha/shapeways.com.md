# Shapeways | privacy statement

We do not sell, rent or license your personal data to third parties. However, please be informed that we may share your personal data with other businesses (our service providers) for example to enable them to provide their services to us or to you (for instance handling your orders). We require these service providers to protect your personal data adequately. They are not allowed to use your personal data for any purpose not specifically authorized by Shapeways or by you.

You should know that these service providers may be located around the world, therefore by ticking the box at the time of registration you agree that your personal information may be transferred from your home country to third parties located around the world.

Your Choice to Disclose: You may choose to make certain details about yourself, such as your avatar, nickname visible on the online community of the website. We are not responsible for any personal data you choose to share on the online community since any personal data you share can be read, collected or used by other individuals in ways we are unable to control or predict, such as to send you unsolicited emails. 

As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us, such as communications relating to your account. Communications relating to your account will only be sent for purposes important to the Services, such as password recovery.

We do not currently collect financial information, as that information is collected and stored by our third party payment processor. However, we may from time to time request and receive some of your financial information from our payment processor for the purposes of completing transactions you have initiated through the services, protecting against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business.

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce our Terms and Conditions, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.

Except as set forth in this Privacy Statement, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
