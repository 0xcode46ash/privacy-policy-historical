This Privacy Statement sets forth the online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply to our Web site. By using the Shadow Shopper Web site, you consent to the policies and practices described in this Statement.

Your data will be stored and processed in whole or in part in the United States. If you access the Shadow Shopper Web site outside the United States, your usage of that site constitutes consent to the transfer of your data out of your country and to the United States.

Our site contains links to other Web sites over which we have no control. Shadow Shopper is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other Web sites to which you choose to link from the Shadow Shopper Web site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other Web sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information. This Privacy Statement applies solely to the information we collect on the Shadow Shopper Web site, and does not apply to information we collect in any other fashion.

INFORMATION COLLECTION

For all processes that require information collection, Shadow Shopper is committed to providing the highest level of security and privacy for Mystery Shopping professionals and customers. 

In some areas of our Web site, Shadow Shopper requests or may request that you provide personal information, including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, social security number, contact information, billing information and any other information from which your identity is discernible. In other areas, Shadow Shopper collects or may collect demographic information that is not unique to you such as your ZIP code, age, preferences, gender, interests and favorites. Sometimes we collect or may collect a combination of the two types of information. Examples of areas on the Shadow Shopper site where we collect personal or combined personal and demographic data are pages where you can open a Shadow Shopper account, sign up to use a service, post a resume, enter a contest, or purchase a product. In addition, Shadow Shopper may indirectly collect information about you when you use certain third party services on our Web site. Such information will be subject to, and treated in accordance with, the policies and practices described in this Statement.

We also gather or may gather certain information about your use of our site, such as what areas you visit and what services you access. Moreover, there is information about your computer hardware and software that is or may be collected by Shadow Shopper. This information can include without limitation your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and referring Web site addresses.

Shadow Shopper may sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive, cultural, behavioral, preferential and/or life style information about yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Statement. For example, such information may be used for the purpose of determining your potential interest in receiving email or other communications about particular products or services.

Please remember that if you post any of your personal information in public areas of Shadow Shopper, such as in online forums or chat rooms, such information may be collected and used by others over whom Shadow Shopper has no control. We are not responsible for the use made by third parties of information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of Shadow Shopper.

USE OF INFORMATION

We use the information we gather on the Shadow Shopper site, whether personal, demographic, collective, or technical, for the purpose of operating and improving the Shadow Shopper Web site, fostering a positive user experience, and delivering the products and services that we offer.

We may also use the information we gather to inform you of other products or services available from Shadow Shopper or its affiliated companies or to contact you about your opinion of current products and services or potential new products and services that may be offered. (The term "affiliated companies" is defined in the section of this Statement entitled "Contact Information")

We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail or other communications regarding updates at the Shadow Shopper site, such as new Shadow Shopper opportunities and additional listings which may be of interest to you. The nature and frequency of these messages will vary depending upon the information we have about you. In addition, at the time of registration for Shadow Shopper, you may have the option to elect to receive additional communications, information, and promotions relating to topics that may be of special interest to you. 

We have an area where you can submit feedback. Any feedback you submit in this area becomes our property, and we can use such feedback for marketing purposes or contact you for further information.

INFORMATION DISCLOSURE TO OTHERS 

We do not disclose to third parties your personal information, combined personal and demographic information, or information about your use of the Shadow Shopper Web site (such as the areas you visit or the services you access), except as set forth in the following four subparagraphs. 

1\. We may disclose such information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you indicate that you would like to receive information about the products or services of third parties at the time you register for a Shadow Shopper account, we may supply your contact information to third parties such as employers, shoppers, recruiters, data aggregators, marketers, or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or otherwise communicating with you. We may use data we have about you (such as the interests and preferences you have expressed) to determine whether you might be interested in the products or services of a particular third-party.

2\. We may disclose such information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf, such as individuals or entities hosting our Web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party.

3\. We may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Shadow Shopper or its affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public. 

4\. We may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of Shadow Shopper's business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event Shadow Shopper becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, Shadow Shopper or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court.

Shadow Shopper may also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to its Web sites with its clients, partners, and other third parties so that they may understand the types of visitors to Shadow Shopper's site and how those visitors use the site. 

BIOGRAPHIES

Since Shadow Shopper is a career site, we give you the option of putting your biography and job listings in our database.

We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume biographies and job listings only to paying employers, shoppers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We are not responsible for the use made of biographies by third parties who access such information while they are in our searchable database. You may remove your biography from our searchable database at any time. However, employers, recruiters, and others who have paid for access to that database or to obtain a copy of that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, may have retained a copy of your biography in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of biographies in these instances.
