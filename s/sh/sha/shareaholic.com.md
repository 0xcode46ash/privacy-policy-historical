# Privacy - Shareaholic

Your Privacy is of the highest concern to us.

Effective June 11, 2008

The Really Big Picture

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Shareaholic we have a few fundamental guiding principles:

  * We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
  * In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, kept private, and permanently deleted.  




Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:

Shareaholic, Inc. (" **Shareaholic** ") operates several websites including [shareaholic.com](http://www.shareaholic.com/), [buzzster.com](http://www.buzzster.com/), and [openshareicons.com](http://www.openshareicons.com/). It is Shareaholic's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our services.

This Privacy Policy covers Shareaholic's treatment of personal information gathered when you use any of Shareaholic's services.

Keeping Information Secure

Shareaholic takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures.

We restrict access to personal information to Shareaholic employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

Your Shareaholic account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You will need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain users choose to interact with our services in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Shareaholic gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at [buzzster.com](http://www.buzzster.com/) to provide a username and email address. In each case, Shareaholic collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the users interaction with Shareaholic. Shareaholic does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging with certain services.

Information we collect and how we use it

  * **Information you provide to us:** We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.

Spam stinks. So we do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent. We respect your privacy and hate SPAM too. ****

  * **Cookies:** To serve you faster and with better quality, we use "cookies" technology. Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which enable a Website to "personalize" itself for each user. We generally use cookies to reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer and to assist with customer tracking. Customer tracking data collected by us is used to optimize your experience by learning whether or not you successfully used Shareaholic. 

Shareaholic users who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Shareaholic's services, with the drawback that certain features of Shareaholic's services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

  * **Log information:** When you use Shareaholic, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you user Shareaholic. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may identify your browser.
  * **Links:** Shareaholic may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our services.
  * **Aggregated statistics:** We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information such as the number of users who engaged in a particular topic, correlations between sharing and item preferences, and how many users chose to share a piece of content. Such information does not identify you individually.  




Third Party Links

This Policy applies to all information that you provide to Shareaholic. However, when you visit websites to which Shareaholic links, you will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own privacy and security policy. If you choose to obtain certain services through a third party site, the data collected by the third party is governed by that third party's privacy policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services.

Information Sharing

Shareaholic will only shares information with individuals outside of Shareaholic in the following limited circumstances:

  * **Protection of Shareaholic and Others:** We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Shareaholic, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
  * **Business Transfers:** In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Shareaholic, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred.
  * **With Your Consent:** Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and you will be able to prevent the sharing of this information by opting out.  




Children

You must be at least 13 years old to use Shareaholic. We do not knowingly collect or use personal information about visitors under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, you can use the services offered only in conjunction with your parents or guardians.

Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, this policy may change from time to time. We will post any policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice on our site. By using our services, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy, and your continued use of our services will signify your acceptance of any changes to this policy.
