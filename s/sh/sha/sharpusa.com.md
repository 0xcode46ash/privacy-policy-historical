## Cookies

A 'Cookie' is a text-only string of characters that is temporarily stored in your computer's memory. Our Cookies are time sensitive. If the expiration of a Cookie is set to be longer than the time you spend on a site, then this string is saved in a Cookie on your hard drive for future reference, otherwise it disappears from your computer when your browser is closed. Cookies such as we use cannot retrieve information from your computer's hard drive, destroy files, or send viruses. When a Cookie is placed on your hard drive, it does not allow access to your personal information although it may be used to identify your computer. Sharp uses Cookies to track the pages that a user visits so that information can be customized to the visitor on a session-by-session basis, and so that future visits may be enhanced. It is a quick and convenient means of keeping site content fresh and relevant to the viewer.

## Web Beacons

In conjunction with Cookies, Sharp uses Web Beacons to monitor traffic generated from various forms of advertising such as banner ads, or to track general traffic. A Web Beacon is a graphic on a web page or in an email message designed to track pages viewed and messages opened. Web Beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-pixel by 1-pixel in size. In many cases, companies place Web Beacons on web pages to collect data about visitors. When a user requests a page on our site, the Web Beacon is retrieved/activated. Once the Web Beacon is retrieved/activated, it points to an external site to retrieve the image. At that time it can also pass along information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web Beacon was viewed and for how long, and the type of browser that retrieved the image. This information is then compiled and made available to Sharp. Web Beacons, along with Cookies, enable us to enhance your experience on SharpUSA and Sharp Direct.

## Security

Sharp takes precautions – including administrative, technical and physical measures – to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and misuse as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. SharpUSA and Sharp Direct use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases from Sharp Direct you must use an SSL-enabled browser. This assists in protecting the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is being transmitted over the internet. Although we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of any personal information collected, we will not be liable for disclosure of personal information obtained due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized acts of third parties. Please be aware that emails you send to us are not transmitted in a secure environment. Therefore we recommend that you do not send sensitive or financial information to us in an email.  
If at any time you would like to make a purchase, but do not want to provide your credit card information online, you may contact a sales representative over the telephone at 1-877-742-7704 to make your purchase by phone.
