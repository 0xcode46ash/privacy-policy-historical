# Privacy Statement | Daily giveaways and discounts | SharewareOnSale

Just like any other website on the internet, we run statistical plugins on SharewareOnSale.com to keep track of website statistics. These plugins track things like what is the most popular post, how many people visited SharewareOnSale on a certain day, how many people downloaded a certain software, etc. Any information collected by these statistical plugins is strictly on how users interact with SharewareOnSale.com. All data is only used for analysis to improve SharewareOnSale.com (e.g. figure out which topics people are interested in). Information from these statistical plugins is never sold, traded, or given away in such a way that may lead to your personal identification. All information from these statistical plugins is used in an aggregated manner to benefit SharewareOnSale.com. If you would like to know exactly what information these statistical plugins are collecting you can check them out for yourself: [Top 10](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/top-10/) and [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/).

We use WooCommerce to power our website and a record is kept of every download you get from us. These records are for your benefit (for us to provide you with support and for you to refer back to if needed — the records can be found in the Your Account section, if you have an account with us); we don’t sell or give this information to third-parties.

Outside of the statistical and WooCommerce usage mentioned above, ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (such as country, name, e-mail address, and IP address) SENT TO US IS ON YOUR OWN ACCORD, SUCH AS WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD A PRODUCT, E-MAIL US, POST A COMMENT, MAKE A FORUM POST, SIGNUP FOR EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS, OR REGISTER ON SHAREWAREONSALE.COM. HOWEVER DO NOT WORRY. WE DO NOTHING WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION (WE DO NOT SELL, TRADE, GIVEAWAY, OR DO OTHER BAD AND MEAN THINGS) EXCEPT TO SEND YOU E-MAILS (THESE E-MAILS WILL NOT BE SPAM) OR A SIMILAR KIND GESTURE; also if the situation demands it, your IP may be compared to that of others to determine if you are a spammer or a repeat offender under a different name. IF YOU DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE GIVING OUT YOUR REAL NAME AND E-MAIL ADDRESS THEN DON’T. WE DON’T CARE. The Internet was not designed to be a private place. IF PRIVACY IS A BIG ISSUE, USE A PROXY, OR OTHER TECHNIQUES, TO HIDE YOUR IP ADDRESS WHENEVER YOU SURF THE INTERNET. YOU ARE ALSO WELCOME TO USE A TEMPORARY E-MAIL ADDRESS. Just be careful when using proxies, because many proxies are not anonymous and can in fact hurt you, in terms of privacy and collecting your personal information, more than not using a proxy. To learn more about what an IP address is, read [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address).

For non-free (aka paid) products and downloads on SharewareOnSale.com, you may be sent directly to a developer’s website/shopping cart to make purchase or your purchase may be processed internally by our own checkout process. All payments via the website/checkout system of developers adhere to their own terms and conditions and privacy policies. All payments made on SharewareOnSale.com via our internal system are processed by third-party payment processing vendors: PayPal and Stripe. All your financial information is stored on their servers and they are responsible for its security.

To earn some revenue to support the efforts of SharewareOnSale.com, We run ads. One of our major ad platforms is Google AdSense ads. Google, and Google’s advertising partners, use special tricks to make sure they are doing good advertising. Here is the official legal blurb:

  * Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.
  * Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.
  * Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).



What Google does is out of our control. Sue them if you don’t like it.

By using SharewareOnSale.com we assume you accept everything mentioned here. If you don’t, leave now. We hate to see you go. =(
