# Privacy

## How your personal information is used by Equiniti  


We (Equiniti Limited and Equiniti Financial Services Limited) may keep the personal details that you or others give us during your relationship with us on an Equiniti database. These details may include:

  * information that you or your agents give us on application forms, in letters, via electronic messages or over the phone
  * what we know from providing you with any services and analysing any transactions you carry out through us
  * information that comes to us from credit reference and fraud detection agencies or services, and registration or stockbroking industry exchanges
  *  information we receive from our client companies or their agents.    




We may store, use and process your personal information in order to:  


  * assess any application you make to participate in any service we provide
  * provide you with services
  * identify other products and services that might be suitable for you
  * keep our records about you up to date
  * check your identity
  * prevent and detect fraud and/or money laundering
  * recover debts, and
  * carry out research and statistical analysis about our services and how we might improve them. Sometimes we may use an outside market research agency to do this for us, in which case we undertake to ensure that they appropriately protect any personal customer data we share with them.



Unless you tell us not to, we may share your information within the Equiniti group and we or they may contact you by email (where this is permitted) or post about:  


  * Equiniti group products and services we believe may interest you.  Our group includes all companies with the Equiniti name and associated companies
  * selected products and services from third party businesses we know and trust.



If you prefer not to receive this kind of information, simply let us know by visiting [www.shareview.co.uk/clients/shareviewoptout](https://web.archive.org/clients/shareviewoptout).

Under the Data Protection Act 1998 you are entitled to a copy of the information we hold about you on request, on payment of a fee. If you think any information we hold about you is inaccurate, don’t hesitate to let us know so that we can correct it.

The information we hold about you is confidential. We will only ever disclose it outside the Equiniti group:

  * at your request or with your consent
  * in line with what we have explained above
  * if the law requires or permits disclosure or there is a duty to the public to reveal it
  *  if we are asked to do so by the Financial Services Authority, the London Stock Exchange or any other relevant regulatory authority or exchange in the UK or overseas
  * to investigate or prevent fraud or other crimes
  * to our client company or companies for whom we act as registrar (directly or indirectly)
  * to our agents and others in connection with running accounts and other services for you
  * to any individual or company to whom we propose to transfer our business or any part of it
  * if we cease to act as registrar for one of the companies in which you hold shares and we are asked by that company to provide them with your email address so that they (or their agent) can contact you about the provision of an equivalent service by the new registrar appointed by them.  Your email address will only be used for this purpose and appropriate safeguards will be put in place to protect your personal data. 



We may administer accounts and provide you with some services via agencies in countries outside Europe, including Jersey and other countries such as India or the USA, where data protection laws and standards differ from those in the UK. But even if we are processing your personal details outside Europe

  * there will always be a contract in place to ensure that such information is appropriately protected, and
  * we will continue to be strictly bound by the UK’s Data Protection Act 1988.

## Monitoring  


We monitor and record some phone calls in case we need to check we have carried out your instructions correctly, to help maintain our quality standards and for security purposes.

## Protecting your privacy
