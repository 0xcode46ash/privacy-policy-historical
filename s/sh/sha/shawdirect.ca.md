Principle 1
Star Choice’s Accountability
Star Choice is responsible for all personal information under its control, including personal
information disclosed to third parties for processing. Star Choice shall designate an individual
who is accountable for the company’s compliance with this Policy.
1.1        The designated individual is responsible for Star Choice’s compliance with this Policy even
           though other individuals within the company may be responsible for the day-to-day collection
           and processing of personal information. Other individuals within the company may be
           delegated to act on behalf of the designated individual. Star Choice may designate separate
           individuals to be responsible for compliance with this Policy, in respect of customers and in
           respect of employees.
1.2        The identity of the individual designated by Star Choice to oversee the company’s
           compliance with this Policy shall be made known internally and shall be made available to
           customers upon request.
1.3        Star Choice shall use contractual or other means to protect personal information that has been
           disclosed to third parties for processing, for example, for billing purposes.
1.4        Star Choice shall implement policies and practices to give effect to this Policy, including:
           a)    implementing procedures to protect personal information;
           b)    establishing procedures to receive and respond to complaints and inquiries;
           c)    training staff to understand and adhere to Star Choice’s policies and procedures; and
privacypolicy.doc                                                                                       5


           d)    informing staff and customers of Star Choice’s policy and procedures.
Principle 2
Identifying the Purposes for Personal Information Collection
Star Choice shall identify the purposes for which personal information is collected at or before
the time the information is collected.
2.1        Star Choice collects personal information only for the following purposes:
           •    to establish and maintain responsible commercial relations with you and provide you with
                ongoing service;
           •    to understand your needs and eligibility for products and services;
           •    to recommend particular products and services to meet your needs;
           •    to develop, enhance, market or provide products and services;
           •    to manage and develop Star Choice’s business and operations, including personnel and
                employment matters; and
           •    to meet legal and regulatory requirements.
           Your personal information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent.
           The purpose of sharing information among the Star Choice companies is to help us identify
           your information, communication and entertainment needs, and to provide you with
           appropriate information and solutions.
2.2        Star Choice shall specify orally, electronically or in writing the purposes for which it collects
           personal information as part of its information management policies and procedures. These
           will include the delivery of direct-to-home satellite services, the marketing and delivery of
           new services, and purposes required or permitted by law. The purposes shall be stated in such
           a manner that the customer can reasonably understand how the information will be used or
           disclosed in order to make consent informed and meaningful.
2.3        When Star Choice proposes to use personal information for a purpose not previously
           identified, the new purpose shall be identified and documented prior to the new use, in the
           manner set out in 2.2 above. Unless the new purpose is required by law, the consent of the
           customer or employee is required before the information can be used for that purpose. (See
           Principle 3 – Consent)
2.4        Upon request, persons collecting personal information shall explain to customers and
           employees the purposes for which the information is being collected.
Principle 3
Obtaining Consent
Star Choice shall obtain consent from its customers and employees before or when it collects,
uses, or discloses personal information, except where inappropriate. Star Choice shall make
reasonable efforts when obtaining consent to ensure that customers and employees understand
how personal information will be used and disclosed by Star Choice.
3.1        Consent is required for the collection of personal information and the subsequent use or
           disclosure of this information. In most cases, Star Choice will seek consent for the use or
privacypolicy.doc                                                                                          6


           disclosure of the information at the time of collection. When Star Choice wants to use
           information for a purpose not previously identified, consent with respect to use or disclosure
           may be sought after the information has been collected, but before it is used.
3.2        Star Choice may collect, use, or disclose personal information without a customer’s or
           employee’s knowledge or consent in instances where legal or security reasons, or the welfare
           of an individual, might make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. For example, when
           personal information is being collected for the detection or prevention of fraud, seeking
           consent might defeat the purpose of collecting the information. All of the circumstances
           where Star Choice may collect, use, or disclose personal information without a customer’s or
           employee’s knowledge or consent are as specified and permitted by legislation.
3.3        Star Choice shall ensure that a customer applying for service is made aware of why the
           company needs the personal information and how the personal information will be used. To
           make the consent informed and meaningful, the purposes must be stated so that a customer
           can reasonably understand how the information will be used or disclosed.
3.4        Star Choice may not, as a condition of providing service, require a customer to consent to the
           collection, use or disclosure of personal information beyond that required to provide the
           service itself.
3.5        Consent can be either express or implied. The form of consent sought by Star Choice may
           vary, depending upon the circumstances and the type of information. In determining the form
           of consent to use, Star Choice shall take into account the sensitivity of the information and
           the reasonable expectations of the customer. Star Choice should generally seek express
           consent when the information is likely to be considered sensitive. Implied consent is
           typically appropriate when the information is less sensitive.
3.6        Customers may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and
           reasonable notice, by contacting Star Choice at http://www.starchoice.com/english/contactus.
           Customers may contact Star Choice for more information regarding the implications of
           withdrawing consent.
3.7        In general, the use of products and services by a customer, or the acceptance of employment
           or benefits by an employee, constitutes implied consent for Star Choice to collect, use and
           disclose personal information for all identified purposes.
Principle 4
Limiting the Collection of Personal Information
The collection of personal information by Star Choice shall be limited to that which is necessary
for the purposes identified by Star Choice. Information shall be collected by fair and lawful
means.
4.1        Star Choice shall collect only the amount and type of personal information needed for
           specified purposes that have been documented by Star Choice and identified to customers and
           employees.
4.2        Star Choice shall not mislead or deceive customers or employees about the purposes for
           which personal information is being collected.
privacypolicy.doc                                                                                       7


Principle 5
Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention of Personal Information
Personal information shall not be used or disclosed by Star Choice for purposes other than
those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the customer or employee, or as
required by law. Personal information shall be retained only as long as necessary for the
fulfillment of those purposes.
5.1        Star Choice shall keep personal information only as long as it remains necessary or relevant
           for the identified purposes or as required by law. Personal information that has been used to
           make a decision about a customer or an employee shall be retained for a period of time that is
           reasonably sufficient to allow the individual access to the information after the decision has
           been made and to permit any recourse under this Policy and applicable privacy legislation.
5.2        Star Choice shall destroy, erase, or make anonymous personal information that is no longer
           required to fulfill the identified purposes. Star Choice has developed guidelines and
           implemented procedures to govern the destruction of personal information.
5.3        Star Choice may disclose a customer’s personal information to:
           a)       a person who, in the reasonable judgment of Star Choice, is seeking the information
                    as an agent of the customer;
           b)       a company for the efficient and cost-effective provision of telecommunications
                    services, subject to confidentiality terms;
           c)       a company involved in supplying the customer with communications or
                    communications directory-related services;
           d)       a company or individual employed by Star Choice to perform functions on its behalf,
                    such as research or data processing;
           e)       another company or individual for the development, enhancement, marketing or
                    provision of any of Star Choice’s products or services;
           f)       an agent used by Star Choice to evaluate the customer’s creditworthiness or to collect
                    the customer’s account;
           g)       a credit reporting agency;
           h)       a public authority or agent of a public authority, if in the reasonable judgment of Star
                    Choice, it appears that there is imminent danger to life or property which could be
                    avoided or minimized by disclosure of the information; and
           i)       a third party or parties, where the customer consents to such disclosure or disclosure
                    is required by law.
5.4        Star Choice may disclose personal information about its employees:
privacypolicy.doc                                                                                          8


           a)       for normal personnel and benefits administration;
           b)       in the context of providing references regarding current or former employees in
                    response to requests from prospective employers; or
           c)       where disclosure is required by law.
5.5        Only Star Choice’s employees with a business need to know, or whose duties reasonably so
           require, are granted access to personal information about customers and employees.
Principle 6
Accuracy of Personal Information
Star Choice shall keep personal information as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as
necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.
6.1        The extent to which personal information shall be accurate, complete, and up-to-date will
           depend upon how Star Choice uses the information, taking into account the interests of the
           customer or employee. Information shall be sufficiently accurate, complete, and up-to-date
           so as to minimize the possibility that inappropriate information may be used to make a
           decision about the customer or employee.
6.2        Star Choice shall update personal information that is used on an on-going basis to fulfil the
           identified purposes including information that is disclosed to third parties.
6.3        Star Choice shall not routinely update personal information where such updated information
           is not needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.
Principle 7
Safeguarding Personal Information
Star Choice shall protect personal information with security safeguards appropriate to the
sensitivity of the information.
7.1        The security safeguards shall protect personal information against loss or theft, as well as
           unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification, regardless of the format in
           which the information is held.
7.2        The nature of the safeguards will vary depending on the sensitivity of the information that has
           been collected, the extent of the information, and the method of storage. More sensitive
           information will be safeguarded by a higher level of protection.
7.3        The methods of protection include:
                a) physical measures, for example, locked filing cabinets and restricted access to
                    offices;
                b) organizational measures, for example, security clearances and limiting access on a
                    “need to know” basis;
                c) technological measures, for example, the use of passwords and encryption; and
                d) investigative measures where required to safeguard the interests of Star Choice, its
privacypolicy.doc                                                                                        9


                    customers or its employees.
7.4        Star Choice shall make their employees aware of the importance of maintaining the
           confidentiality of personal information.
7.5        Star Choice shall dispose of personal information in a manner that prevents unauthorized
           parties from gaining access to the information.
Principle 8
Openness about Policies and Procedures
Star Choice shall make readily available to customers and employees specific information about
its policies and procedures relating to the management of personal information.
8.1        Star Choice shall be open about its policies and procedures with respect to the management of
           personal information. Customers and employees shall be able to acquire information about a
           company’s policies and procedures at minimal cost and without unreasonable effort. This
           information shall be made available in a form that is generally understandable. This
           information is available by writing to Star Choice, to the attention of the Privacy Officer.
           Contact details are available online at: http://www.starchoice.com/english/contactus.
8.2        The information made available by Star Choice shall include:
                a) the name, title and address of the individual who is accountable for Star Choice’s
                    policies and procedures and to whom complaints or inquiries can be forwarded;
                b) the means of gaining access to personal information held by Star Choice;
                c) a description of the type of personal information held by Star Choice, including a
                    general account of its use;
                d) a copy of any documents that describe Star Choice’s policies, standards, and/or
                    policies; and
                e) a description of personal information made available to related organizations,
                    including subsidiaries, affiliates or agents.
Principle 9
Providing Access to Personal Information
Upon request, and unless prohibited by law, Star Choice shall inform customers and employees
of the existence, use, and disclosure of their personal information and provide access to that
information. An individual shall be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the
