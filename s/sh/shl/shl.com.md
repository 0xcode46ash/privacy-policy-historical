__Other Technologies__ : We may use standard Internet technology, such as Web beacons (also called clear GIFs or pixel tags), and other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of our Sites and content presented via the Sites.

As with the social buttons we cannot prevent these sites, or external domains, from collecting information on your usage of this embedded content. If you are not logged in to these external services then they will not know who you are but are likely to gather anonymous usage information e.g. number of views, plays, loads etc.
