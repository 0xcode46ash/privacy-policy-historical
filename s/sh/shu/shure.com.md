# Shure - Privacy

### Privacy And Security

Shure Incorporated has created this policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to our Web site users' privacy, and discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for all Shure Incorporated Web sites. The long and the short of it is that we are firm believers in keeping your information your own. We will not sell or trade your personal information to any other company.

 **IP Address**

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site and to gather broad demographic information. We also use your IP address to help identify you and your shopping cart.

 **Cookies**

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. If you prefer to leave your cookies turned off, you will not be remembered by our shopping cart and you will need to re-identify yourself each time you shop. We reserve the right to use cookies for other purposes as well.

 **User Contact Information**

We use registration forms, order forms, and online surveys that require users to provide us their contact information such as name, address, email, etc. We may use this information to provide additional information about Shure that we feel will interest our users. We do not share or sell this data outside Shure.

Users are also offered the option to opt-out of receiving these messages if they so desire at the points where we request contact information. We also provide visitors with the option of removing their information from our database should they no longer wish to receive future communications from Shure. To do this, simply send an email to [info@shure.com](mailto:info@shure.com).

 **Third-Party Advertising Technology**

We use DoubleClick DART, a third-party advertising technology, on some sections and/or pages of our website to collect information when you visit our site and serve ads on sites upon which we advertise. This technology uses information about your visits to this website and the sites upon which we advertise (not including your name, address, or other personal information).

In the course browsing our site, a unique third-party cookie may be placed on your computer or recognized on your browser.

In addition, we use electronic images known as Web bugs (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or beacons), provided by our ad serving partner, that allow us to track general user traffic patterns. The information we collect and share through the use of tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable information.
