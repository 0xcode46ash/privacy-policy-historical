# Privacy Policy - Shudoo

Our privacy policy is very simple - we will NEVER share any information that you give us with a third party except to provide you with better service, where we are required to do so by law, or unless stated otherwise.

You may browse the shudoo.co.uk website without entering your personal details. However, at some stages on the website you may be asked for personal information to enable us to reply to any enquiries and/or process your order.

If you register an account with shudoo.co.uk we keep a record of your personal information including name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and if you place an order, some of your credit card details (i.e. without the CV2 security number). No transactions can take place without the card CV2 number. This information is stored in our database so we may recognise you as a registered customer and to speed up any future orders you place with us.

We also keep a record of your purchases, which enables us to improve our service to our customers. E-mail correspondence is saved so we may track questions or concerns you may have with our products or service.

Any information stored about you by shudoo.co.uk is used only to improve our products and service and we will use your personal information only for:

• Processing orders as effectively as possible  
• Business analysis to make your shopping experience with us in the future as quick & as simple as possible.
