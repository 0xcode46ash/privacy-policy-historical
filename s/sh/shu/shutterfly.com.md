Shutterfly is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for www.shutterfly.com.

[](https://www.truste.org/validate/6410)

TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this web site has agreed to notify you of:

  1. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the web site
  2. The organization collecting the information
  3. How the information is used
  4. With whom the information may be shared
  5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information
  6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Shutterfly's control
  7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.



If you feel that this company is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should first contact Shutterfly.

If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.

We at Shutterfly know how much you value your privacy, so we make sure that your privacy is protected any time you're using our services. You do need to give us some personal information so we're able to process your pictures and requests. However, we want you to know exactly what information we need, why we need it, and how we make sure that your information is protected. We want you to be able to enjoy Shutterfly experience safely and privately.

**Your Shutterfly account**  
When you sign up with Shutterfly, you establish a password-protected personal account for storing your digital images and managing print and other services. You and you alone control who may view the images stored in your Shutterfly account.

If you contact us via e-mail prior to signing up for an account, we will not use that e-mail address for any purposes other than responding to your inquiry.

**Information we need from you**  
In order to establish your private Shutterfly account, we need some personal information from you when you sign up:

  * name
  * e-mail address
  * password (to sign in to your own account)



When you order prints we also need a:

  * mailing address (to ship the prints to you or to the person(s) you choose)
  * billing name and address (for verification purposes only)
  * credit card number and expiration date



Shutterfly is the shipper for all products purchased on the Shutterfly website. We use [Signio](http://www.signio.com/) for credit card processing. Signio will not use your information for any purpose other than processing your order. We only save your credit card information when you enter it for the purposes of placing an order if you choose for us to do so.

If you want to share photos with friends, you need to enter their e-mail addresses. Shutterfly will e-mail the people you select and invite them to come to Shutterfly to view your photos. If they are not currently Shutterfly members, and you choose to require that they sign in to view your pictures, they will need to create a password, and accept the terms & conditions of the Shutterfly service. They will be able to choose whether or not they wish to receive further emails from Shutterfly.

If you use our Tell A Friend program to refer your friends, we will only use their email addresses to send the Tell A Friend announcement with your personal message. We will not add them to a mailing list, and will not send them further e-mail unless they sign up and choose to receive such communications from us per this privacy policy.

Within your Shutterfly account, you are given a private address book where you can store mailing addresses and e-mail addresses for your friends and family. Shutterfly will never use that information for any secondary purposes.

We may occasionally request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and mailing address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Shutterfly service.

**Changing your information**  
To update your personal information, simply sign in and go to 'Account info' from your personal home page. You may also contact our Customer Service team. You can make changes to your account information at any time.

**Protecting your information**  
Shutterfly uses industry best practices to protect your information and your privacy. When your password or credit card number are requested on the site, we use SSL to present secure pages to protect that information. We also guarantee that every order you make at Shutterfly will be 100% safe. This means that we will reimburse you for any fraudulent charges that are not covered by your bank and that result through no fault of your own from purchases made at Shutterfly while using the secure server.

You can tell if you are using a secure server by looking at the bottom of your browser window. In Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see a lock icon. When the symbol is unbroken or the padlock appears to be in its closed state, the page is encrypted and therefore secure. If you wish to take advantage of the latest encryption standards, be sure you have the latest version of the browser you're using. You can download the latest version from the Netscape or Microsoft Web sites. Beta versions of browsers are not recommended.

**Protecting your pictures**  
Only you decide if and when your pictures are shared. We are committed to keeping your pictures private and secure. Your pictures are never made publicly accessible, and are shared only by your explicit action.

**Protecting against accidental deletion of your pictures**  
To help you with accidental deletions, Shutterfly holds photos that you've deleted for at least 2 weeks, but no more than 45 days (we clean them out in the middle of each month). If you need to recover deleted photos please send us an e-mail. We'll restore all of the photos you've deleted in the last hold period and send you a confirmation e-mail.

**Passwords**  
Your account is protected by a password. You choose a password when you first start an account with us. Do not share your password with anyone else.

Your password needs to:

  * be between 4 and 10 characters long
  * include both numbers and letters
  * not contain symbols (*, $, #, %, etc.)
  * not be a word in the dictionary



Examples:  
Valid passwords: F3M8N1, Samue8l, B1962illa

Make sure to select a password that isn't obvious. A good password includes seemingly random letters and numbers, for example, F3M8N1. You can change your password at any time, and you can set a new password in case you forgot your old one.

**e-mail notification of new Shutterfly features and special offers**  
We will notify you about new features and services on Shutterfly ONLY if you request to receive this information when you register as a new user. You may subscribe or unsubscribe to this notification service through your account profile on the Shutterfly website.

We may send you site and service announcement updates with important information about the service. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements.

**Sharing your information with third parties**  
We will share your e-mail address with pre-screened third parties ONLY if you request to receive offers of interest from these companies when you register as a new user. You may subscribe or unsubscribe to this notification service through your account profile on the Shutterfly website.

**Cookies**  
Cookies are pieces of information that your browser receives from Web sites and stores on your computer's hard drive. Information in cookies includes preferences you select while visiting a particular Web site. For example, by storing cookies on your hard drive, you'll return to a specific Web site with the same settings you used on a previous visit.

Shutterfly never saves information such as your password or your credit card number on cookies. We do require cookies in order to manage and protect your Shutterfly session, and if you choose, to store your e-mail address (so you don't have to type it in every time you log in). If you have cookies turned off, you will not be able to access the Shutterfly service.

**Log files**  
Our servers store IP addresses for all connections to the service. This data is analyzed in the aggregate for administration purposes and is not linked to your personal account. Occasionally, we may use the IP logs to gather information that might help Customer Support respond to an inquiry by you about your account, but will not do so without an initial action by you.

**Pixel Tags**  
Shutterfly sends email messages to customers who are opted-in for such communications using a third party provider (DoubleClick). These messages may contain pixel tags (also known as "clear gifs" or "web beacons"). These tags provide statistical information to Shutterfly so we can better understand what communications are successful. The tags may indicate which email addresses responded to a particular email, but the statistics gathered are only used in aggregate.

**Legal exceptions to the rules**  
Only in the case of our good-faith belief that the law requires it or, to protect your or Shutterfly's rights or property, will we disclose customer information to proper law enforcement authorities even though you might have sent us an e-mail requesting that we don't share your information. This information may be necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone who may attempt to cause injury to another's rights or property.

**Making general information on groups of our customers available to other companies**  
Shutterfly may share very general information about our customers as a whole group with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we might say that a certain percentage of our customers live in California, while a different percentage live in New Jersey. We use this data to customize our service offerings and content based on your needs. This data is not personally identifiable.

**Notification of changes**  
If our privacy policy changes, we will e-mail our users announcing that the new privacy policy, and if applicable, provide users with a way to opt out of any changes to the way their personal information will be used.

**Staying current with your information and our policies**  
Shutterfly will do our utmost to keep all your information up to date, and to guard your privacy by continuously evaluating the enforcement and nature of our policies.

  * If any of your personal information changes, or you identify a mistake in our records, please use the account profile page on the Shutterfly website, or contact us and we will update our data right away.
  * Please contact us to communicate any questions or concerns.
