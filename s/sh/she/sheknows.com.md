We collect and store the following information about you: the IP address or name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are coming from an America Online account, or yale.edu if you are connecting from a Yale domain): the date and time you access our site; the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site; and your Operating System and Browser. We use the information to measure the number of visitors to the sections of our site, which, in turn, helps us make our site more useful. The browser information is used to develop and code pages so most people will be able to view the site correctly. We also maintain information volunteered by site visitors, including contest/sweepstakes entries; survey information; board/site registrations; additions to reviews, due date and other databases; notebook registration; and e-mail list membership.

If you believe your e-mail address was been subscribed to a list in error, please contact [feedback@myria.com](mailto:feedback@myria.com) with the e-mail address that was incorrectly subscribed and a note stating the error so we may correct this problem.
