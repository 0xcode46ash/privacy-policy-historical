We use the information to measure the number of visitors to the sections of our site, which, in turn, helps us make our site more useful.

If you believe your e-mail address was been subscribed to a list in error, please contact [feedback@SheKnows.com](mailto:feedback@SheKnows.com) with the e-mail address that was incorrectly subscribed and a note stating the error so we may correct this problem. (Unsubscription information is also included with each newsletter message.)
