**Privacy & Security**  
| **Secure Ordering**  
Your order and credit card information is encrypted to prevent anyone else from reading it. It is safer to order online through a "secure" site, than to have your credit card imprinted in a retail store or restaurant.  
| **Will Sheplers ever disclose my information?**  
No. Sheplers does not sell, trade, or rent any internet customer's personal information to others. In the event that there is a change to this policy, we will post that change here on our website.  
| **E-Mail Marketing from Sheplers**  
As a courtesy to our customers, Sheplers may contact you via e-mail to notify you of announcements or special offers that may be available. We promise not to contact you more than once per month. If you do not want to receive these notifications from us, please send an e-mail to [remove@sheplers.com](mailto:remove@sheplers.com?subject=remove) with the word REMOVE in the subject line.  
| **In Summary**  
Sheplers is committed to protecting your privacy. If you have questions or concerns regarding privacy, please contact us at [webmaster@sheplers.com](mailto:webmaster@sheplers.com?Subject=Privacy%20Concern).  
| **What about 'Cookies'?**  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent this. Sheplers does use cookie information to enhance your overall shopping experience.
