Privacy & Security 

Will Sheplers ever disclose my information?

Secure Ordering

Your order and credit card information is encrypted to prevent anyone else from reading it. It is safer to order online through a "secure" site, than to have your credit card imprinted in a retail store or restaurant.

E-Mail Marketing from Sheplers

As a courtesy to our customers, Sheplers may contact you via e-mail to notify you of announcements or special offers that may be available. We promise not to contact you more than once per month. If you do not want to receive these notifications from us, please send an e-mail to [remove@sheplers.com](mailto:remove@sheplers.com?subject=remove) with the word REMOVE in the subject line.

In Summary

Sheplers is committed to protecting your privacy. If you have questions or concerns regarding privacy, please contact us at [webmaster@sheplers.com](mailto:webmaster@sheplers.com?Subject=Privacy%20Concern).
