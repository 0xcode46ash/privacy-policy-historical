### Email Communications

Sheetmusicdirect.com uses "clear gifs" (also known as pixel tags) and other techniques to record information about our email communications. A clear gif is an invisible graphic file that we include in most of our HTML-based emails. 

When a message with a clear gif is opened, your email program will access Sheetmusicdirect's servers to retrieve the image file, allowing Sheetmusicdirect to record and store information such as: 

  * date and time the email was opened,
  * if a user is capable of receiving HTML emails.



Our HTML emails also record information on which links within an email have been clicked on. We use this information to optimise our email communications, and provide a better service to our customers. 

If you wish to opt-out of receiving HTML emails from us and would rather receive text emails (which we do not track), please follow the instructions given in our newsletters, or contact [newsletter@sheetmusicdirect.com](mailto:newsletter@sheetmusicdirect.com).

### Anti-Spam

Sheetmusicdirect.com is opposed to the sending of unsolicited email, otherwise known as "spam". Sheetmusicdirect will not sell, exchange or distribute members' confidential information from our opt-in email lists to any third party. 

All emails sent by Sheetmusicdirect that are not directly related to an order placed on our site (ie where you have opted to receive our newsletter) will have instructions on how to unsubscribe or opt-out of our mailing list in the footer of the message. 

Sheetmusicdirect is committed to following the electronic mail guidelines (Regulations 22 and 23) of the Privacy And Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003.
