# Privacy Policy

    

At Shelf Reliance, we recognize the importance of your personal privacy. In the paragraphs below, you'll find basic information about the types of personal information we receive and collect when you use Shelf Reliance's services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard information. If you have any additional questions or comments about our policy, please feel free to [contact us](http://beta.shelfreliance.com/contact-us).

Our site's registration form requires you to give us contact information (like your name and email address) and a unique identifier (your login name). Your contact information is used to contact you only when necessary. Unique identifiers are collected for use as account numbers in our record system. Passwords are used for authenticating your access to the site and modifying your personal information.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Web site. We use cookies to remember you between visits so you don't have to log in each time. We may use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information.

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Your Shelf Reliance password is not stored in our database. Instead, your password is irreversibly encrypted using RSA's MD5 algorithm. This means that a hacker who breaks into the Shelf Reliance server and steals the database will not be able to discover your password.
