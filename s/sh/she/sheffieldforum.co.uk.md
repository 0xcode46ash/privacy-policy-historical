**Automatic Collection of Data**  
17\. The Website automatically captures and stores the following data when you visit the Website: your IP address, when you last visited the Website and when you last posted.  
18\. All networks connected to the Internet communicate in “IP” (Internet Protocol), which is a technical standard that allows data to be transmitted between two devices. “TCP/IP” (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is responsible for making sure messages get from one host to another and that the messages are understood. An IP address is a string of code which identifies your personal computer and tells the Internet that you are connected.  
19\. We use Google Analytics to analyse traffic on the Website, including the number of visitors to the Website and the number of page views. This helps us gauge traffic and the popularity of certain pages.  
20\. We may use cookies for collecting information on the Website. Cookies are messages given to an Internet browser by an Internet server. The browser, in a text file called cookie.txt, then stores the message. Each time the browser requests a page from the server, this message is sent back. A cookie's main objective is to identify users and personalise their visit by customising web pages for them, for example by welcoming them by name next time they visit the same website.  
21\. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use anonymous information (i.e. not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
