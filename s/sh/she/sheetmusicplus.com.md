**Information Collected**  
When you order, we need to know your name, email address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. When you sign up for our free newsletter or other information services, we need only an email address, which we use to send the information you requested. If you refer someone to our site through the SheetMusicPlus Tell-a-Friend service, we ask for your email address and that of the recipient in order to complete your request. We will never disclose or send promotional email to recipient addresses provided only to the Sheet Music Plus Tell-a-Friend service. We do not save or store email addresses submitted using tell-a-friend service.

**Use of Information Collected**  
We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and optimize layout of the store. We personalize your shopping experience by using your purchases to shape our recommendations about products that might be of interest to you. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information we provide easy options to not receive it. If you already subscribe to our emails, each email contains a link to [opt-out](http://notes.sheetmusicplus.com/store/email_unsubscribe.html?cart=3416054728162303) of future mailings. If you use more than one email address, remember to unsubscribe from each email address that you have given to us.

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses and browser types to monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and optimize layout of the store. IP addresses are not linked to any personally identifiable information on a permanent basis. We do record the IP when an order is placed for security. However since IP addresses generally change for visitors due to the nature of the internet they are not used for any purpose other than for prosecuting a fraudulent order.

**Gift Certificates**  
When you order a gift certificate, we need to know your name, email address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This information allows us to process your order and to notify you of your order status. When ordering an email gift certificate we also need the recipient's name and email address to send the gift certificate. When ordering a postal mail gift certificate, we need the recipient's name and mailing address to send the gift certificate. 

**Contact Us**  
When you contact us through our Contact Us page, including the Instant Comment feature, we only use any information given to reply to your request or comment. Rest assured, we do not use this information to send you unsolicited email. 

**Protection and Security of Customer Information**  
When you place an order at SheetMusicPlus, your personal information and credit card information is safe. That's because we've taken steps to ensure a secure and superior shopping environment. We use state-of-the-art secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology that protects the transmission and storage of your credit card information.

SheetMusicPlus.com uses VeriSign digital certificate technology to assure that your transactions are executed safely on our secure servers. VeriSign Inc. is the leading provider of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and digital certificate solutions used by enterprises, web sites, and consumers to conduct secure communications and transactions over the internet. VeriSign independently verifies the identity and background of a business prior to issuing digital key certificates. These certificates enable you to be certain that transactions entered on our site are encrypted so that your data can only be read by our secure servers. You may click on the Verisign link in the left column to see our current Verisign SSL security certificate.

**Use of "Cookies"**  
At times we use a feature of your Web browser to send your computer a "cookie," a small data file that's stored on your hard drive. We do not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information from your computer. We use cookies to enhance your experience at SheetMusicPlus, and to give you better, more personalized service once you've purchased or registered. We use this information for internal use only; we don't share it with others. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

**Testimonials**  
When customers compliment our site, we contact them via email and ask permission to post the compliments in our Testimonial Section. When we ask for testimonial permission, we also ask for permission to print personal contact information, including name, email address, city and state. Customers can choose to include any or none of the contact information. This information is only used to post on our site.

**Third Party Disclosure**  
We are committed to protecting your privacy. NoteAble Holdings Inc., as the sole owner of SheetMusicPlus.com, does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and processing credit card payments. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of SheetMusicPlus customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. You must sign up to receive such offers. If you have previously signed up and wish to change this preference just [opt-out](http://notes.sheetmusicplus.com/store/email_unsubscribe.html?cart=3416054728162303).

**Business Transfers**  
NoteAble Holdings, Inc. is the sole owner of SheetMusicPlus. As we develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that NoteAble Holdings, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 

**Affiliates and Affiliated Businesses**  
When you sign up as an affiliate we need your name, email address, mailing address and the primary URL address of your website. This information allows us to track visitors from your site and to send you any commissions from sales. Aggregate sales data is shared with affiliates so commissions can be paid. Aggregate sales data does not include personally identifying information.

We work closely with our affiliated businesses which we do not control. In some cases, these businesses operate stores at NoteAble Holdings, Inc or sell offerings to you at SheetMusicPlus.com. In other cases, NoteAble Holdings, Inc., operates stores, provides services, or sells product lines jointly with these businesses. For example, [Sheet Music Logistics](http://www.sheetmusiclogistics.com/) provides fulfillment services for our partners. You can tell when another business is involved in your transactions, and we share customer information related to those transactions with that business.

**Links**  
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any another site. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**Your Consent and Notification of Changes**  
By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by SheetMusicPlus and it's owner NoteAble Holdings, Inc. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
