### Information We Collect

We collect information from you in several ways, including when you choose to share information with us by entering it on our sites or applications, through the postings that you make, and by using automated processes. We also collect information about your transactions with us, such as purchases and returns.

#### Information You Provide to Us

We may ask you and you may choose to provide certain personal information to us, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, mailing and billing addresses and telephone number. We use Authorize.net to process payments, and Sundial does not store any credit card or other payment data. Please click here to view the Authorize.net privacy policy. You may also choose to provide us with information about your gender, marital status, occupation, family or other details. We may collect this information in various places, including account registration forms, during the checkout process when you make a purchase, through “contact us” forms or in other parts of our websites and applications.

#### Postings You Make

You may choose to make postings, such as product reviews, comments, or other content, on our sites and applications. Any content that you choose to post on our sites and applications, including information about you such as your name or your photo or likeness, will be publicly available for viewing and potential use by others. We may use the content that you post for any purpose(s) that we deem appropriate, including advertising, marketing, publicity, and promotional activities, and we may choose whether to attribute such content to you when we use it. For full terms and conditions regarding such postings (sometimes called “user content” or “user- generated content”), please read our Terms of Use.

#### Automated Information Collection

We may automatically collect certain information when you visit our sites or use our applications. This information may include your IP address (or other unique device identifier, including one that we may assign); certain details about your browser, operating system, and hardware; your location, if available; the URL that referred you to our site; your activities on our site, including your preferences; and other logging information, such as the date and time of your visit. We may use a variety of tracking technologies to automatically collect information, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, browser fingerprinting, GPS, iBeacons, and ETags (or “entity tags”). A cookie (or “locally shared object”) is a data file placed on your device when you visit our site. Your browser, or other software (including Adobe Flash), may allow you to reject or remove cookies, but if you do so, some features of our sites may not work properly, and we may not be able to remember your preferences the next time that you visit. We also use web server logs to collect and store information about site usage. When you use our mobile applications or visit our sites from a mobile device, like a smartphone, we may also collect additional information from your device, including your location, device identifier, and information about your mobile network.

#### Analytics Services and Targeted Ads

We use third-party analytics services, including, but not necessarily limited to, Google Analytics. These services may track details about your online activities over time and across different sites. These services help us to improve our sites and the products and services that we offer you. These services may also allow us and others to provide you with targeted advertisements or other content that you may be interested in based on your online activities. You can learn more about Google Analytics and your choices at this link. If you would like to learn more about targeted ads that may be based on your online activities, and the choices that you may exercise for certain sites and advertisers, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance.

#### How We Use the Information That We Collect

We use the information that we collect from you to process transactions, such as your purchases and returns, and to provide you with information that may be of interest to you, such as e-mail newsletters, special offers, or details regarding new products, services or upcoming events. We also use the information that we collect to process your account registration and to enable you to use certain site features and participate in online sweepstakes, contests or other promotions. We may also use the information that we collect to customize your experience on our sites or applications, to provide customer support, to enforce our Terms of Use and to provide you with content or advertisements that may be of interest to you, as described in the section above on Analytics Services and Targeted Ads.

#### How and When We Share Information with Third Parties

We may share the information that we collect with third parties for a variety of purposes. For example, we may share information with service providers who assist us in our business operations. We may also share information where required by law or to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, government request or other legal process. We may also share information with third parties, including law enforcement, to protect our sites and applications and to enforce our Terms of Use. We also reserve the right to share the information that we collect with our subsidiaries and affiliates and with any subsequent owner in the event of a merger, consolidation, sale of our assets or other change in our business.

#### Co-Branded Areas

We may provide certain parts of our sites and applications in association with third parties, such as promotional partners. These “co-branded areas” will identify the third party. If you choose to use these co-branded areas, we may share your information with the identified third party, and that third party may also collect information from you, in addition to the information that we collect, as described above. You should review the privacy policies of those identified third parties to understand how they collect and use information.

#### Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions

We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions on our sites and applications, and these activities may require specific registration. By participating in these activities, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern them, and those rules may require that you allow information, including your photo, likeness or other details, to be shared with third parties, made public or used for advertising, marketing or other promotional purposes. You should review the official rules regarding information collection and sharing for each of these activities before you choose to participate.

### Direct Marketing Partners and Your Choices

We may share the information that we collect, including your name, e-mail address, mailing address, or other details, with third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you would prefer that we not share information about you with such third parties for direct marketing purposes, you may opt-out by sending an e-mail to legal@sundialbrands.com, or by writing to Sundial Brands LLC, Attn: Legal Dept., 11 Ranick Drive, South Amityville, NY 11701. When making such a request, please include enough information in your request to help us identify you in our records, such as your name, account name, e-mail address and mailing address.

## Third-Party Sites & Services

### Interactions with Other Sites and Services

Our sites and applications may allow you to use your account from other online services, including social media providers like Facebook and Google. If you use accounts from other services on our sites or applications, those third parties may share information about you with us, and we may share information that we collect with them. Our sites and applications may also include features from third parties that allow you to interact with other online services, including social media. For example, we may use third parties to allow you to send messages or tweets or to make postings on social media sites, like Facebook. If you use these features, then we may share information about you with those third parties, and they may collect additional information. You should review the privacy policies for such third parties to understand how they collect and use information.

### Links to Third-Party Sites

Our sites and applications may include links to third-party websites or other online services. We are not responsible for these other sites and services, and they may collect and use information about you. You should review the privacy policies for such third parties before using their sites or services to understand how they collect and use information.

### Third-Party Tracking and Do Not Track

Third parties may use tracking technologies in connection with our sites and applications, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these third-party technologies because we may not control them and we are not responsible for them. Do Not Track is a technology that enables users to opt out of tracking by websites they do not visit. Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to Do Not Track technology.

### Updating Your Information

Our sites and applications may allow you to update the information that we collect from you, such as the contact information that you provide when you register for an account. You may also request that we update your information by sending an e-mail to us at support@sundialbrands.com. Our sites and applications may also allow you to update your e- mail preferences. If you would prefer not to receive e-mail newsletters or other messages from us, you may use the “unsubscribe” features that are included in such messages or contact us at support@sundialbrands.com.

### How We Protect Your Information

We use commercially reasonable and industry standard security technologies and safeguards to protect the information that we collect and use. For example, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for our registration and ordering functions, and we utilize a PCI-certified service provider to process credit card payments. We also expect our service providers to protect information in the same manner. However, no data transmission over the Internet, mobile networks, wireless transmission or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed 100% secure. Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us.

### Transfer of Information to the United States

Our sites and applications are operated in the United States and are intended for users located in the United States. The privacy and data protection laws in the United States differ from those of other countries. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that the information that we collect will be transferred to and processed, stored, and used in the United States, and that by using our sites and applications, you consent to such transfers and processing.

### Children’s Privacy

Our sites and applications are intended for general audiences, and we do not knowingly seek or collect personal information from children under the age of 18. In accordance with the Child Online Privacy Protection Act, in the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any personal information from or about a child, please contact us at support@sundialbrands.com.

### Privacy Policy Changes

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time and we will post notice of any such changes on our website. Your use of our sites or applications after the effective date constitutes your acceptance of the amended terms and conditions. We reserve the right to apply the amended terms to the information that we have already collected, subject to any legal constraints.
