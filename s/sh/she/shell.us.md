Your information may be collected by Shell US or by a third party, such as a co-sponsor or a vendor involved in, or providing services in connection with, a promotion, or an e-commerce partner in the case of a credit card application or payment (e.g. Citigroup).

If you make a purchase or enter a promotion on our site, Shell US will collect your personally identifiable information, and you are deemed to consent to us providing your information to third parties who provide certain services such as processing of credit card transactions, customer service, promotions, order fulfillment and/or prize delivery, as applicable.

(As more fully described below in Use, Disclosure, and Sharing of Information - Personally Identifiable Information, these third parties are prohibited from using this information for their own marketing purposes and/or from sharing, selling, or otherwise distributing any personal data of our customers, unless you choose to opt in for such additional uses and/or disclosure by the third parties, under their respective privacy policies.)

###  Customer Service 

Some services may offer support and technical assistance through customer service centers via telephone, online chat, or e-mail.

###  Non-Personally Identifiable Information 

From time to time, Shell US may use and share with third parties aggregate, non-personally identifiable user information to show general demographic and preference information among users of this site.

###  Personally Identifiable Information 

Shell US uses information about you to deliver the services that you request, to keep you informed about changes affecting our services or your account, to inform you of other services or promotions in which you might be interested, and to improve and enhance our site and services.

  
If you opt in to receive e-mail from us, you can always opt out of future marketing messages by following the directions in each message to "unsubscribe" or by [sending an email to the Shell US site](https://forms.shell.com/home/forms/usa/aboutshell/contact_feedback/form_us_feedback.html "sending an email to the Shell US site"), or by sending postal mail to this address: [Shell Oil Company, 910 Louisiana, Ste. 4442B, Houston, TX 77002].

However, if you choose to opt out of marketing messages, we reserve the right to contact you regarding your account status, technical support, product information, changes to account terms, and any other matter that might affect our service to you and/or any products you purchased from us or registered with us, as applicable.

As stated above in Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect -  Promotions and Purchases, Shell US may also work with third parties to provide some services on our sites.

In connection with those services, you are deemed to consent to us sharing your information with third parties who provide services such as issuing Shell US credit cards, processing credit card transactions, customer service, promotion administration, order fulfillment and/or prize delivery, as applicable.

Third parties who provide, or participate in, services on this site are prohibited from using our customers' personally identifiable information for marketing purposes and/or from sharing, selling, or otherwise using such information, unless you choose to opt in to marketing, sharing, or other uses by the third parties.

If you do not want your information to be used for marketing (or other purposes unrelated to the provision of services you have requested) by a third party who participates in a service on one of our sites, do not opt in to such use by that third party when you register to participate in the service.

Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy.

If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.

Where we disclose your personal data for purposes which are different to those described above we will obtain your consent prior to disclosure.

Except as set out in this privacy policy, Shell US will not disclose any personally identifiable information without express permission unless legally entitled or required to do so (by legal process or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime or to comply with applicable laws) or in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of Shell US’ assets.

###  Keeping our records accurate 

We aim to keep our information about you as accurate as possible.

  * [If you would like to review or change the details you have supplied us with, please send an email.](https://forms.shell.com/home/forms/usa/aboutshell/contact_feedback/form_us_feedback.html)



###  Security of your personal data 

We have implemented technology and policies with the objective of protecting your personal information from unauthorised access and improper use and will update these measures as new technology becomes available, as appropriate.

###  Use of your personal information submitted to other web sites 

We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other web sites even if:

  * you accessed the third party web site using links from this site; or you linked to this site from a third party web site. 
  * We recommend that you check the policy of each site you visit and contact the owner or operator of such web site if you have any concerns or questions. 



###  Data transfers 

Personal information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Shell or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of the United States.

By way of example, this may happen if any of our servers are located in a country outside of the US or one of our service providers is located in a country outside of the US. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the US.

If we transfer your information outside of the US in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected. In addition, if you use our services while you are outside the US, your information may be transferred outside the US in order to provide you with those services.

###  Will this privacy policy change? 

From time to time we may make changes to this privacy policy to reflect changes in our services and customer feedback. When we post changes to this policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the bottom of the policy.

If there are material changes to this policy or in how we will use your personal information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change, by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this policy.
