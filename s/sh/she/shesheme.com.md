# SheSheMe.com

Shesheme.com is firmly committed to maintaining the privacy and protection of your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines our efforts to maintain your privacy. 

**Why Did You Receive An Email From Us?**

You receive mailings from shesheme.com for two possible reasons:

  * Your email address has been provided to us as someone who has expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving information in the future ("opt-in"); 
  * You have purchased or registered or otherwise have an existing relationship with us. 



We respect your time and attention by controlling the content and frequency of our mailings. 

**How Your Privacy Is Protected**

shesheme.com uses security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data you have provided to us.

**Usage and Sharing**

We do not sell, share, or rent individual personal information with anyone without your advance written permission or unless ordered by a court of law. We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information, for purposes of contacting you or sending you emails based on your request for information and to contracted service providers for purposes of providing services relating to our communications with you. We may transfer the information that you have provided to us if shesheme.com is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, shesheme.com will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

**How Can You Stop Receiving Email From She She Me?**

Each email sent contains an easy and automated way for you to stop receiving email messages from shesheme.com in the future. If you would like to do this – to “opt-out” — simply follow the links at the bottom of every email message. 

If you have received unwanted or unsolicited email sent via the shesheme.com system or purporting to be sent via the shesheme.com system, please forward a copy of that email with your comments to [customerservice@shesheme.com](mailto:customerservice@shesheme.com). We will look into the matter immediately.
