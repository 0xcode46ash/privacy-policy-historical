Sheridan is committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal information whether you are browsing for information or conducting business with us electronically.

Sheridan is responsible for the personal information under its control and complies with the 10 principles of PIPEDA to the best of its ability. All Sheridan staff members are responsible for compliance to this policy when handling personal information.

**Principle 2 - Identifying purposes**

Unless it is self-evident the purposes for which personal information is collected shall be identified at the time the information is collected.

Principle 4 - Limiting collection**

When you visit our web sites, we will not collect your personal information unless you choose to use and receive online products and services that require it. We will only collect the information that is absolutely necessary for the identified purpose.
