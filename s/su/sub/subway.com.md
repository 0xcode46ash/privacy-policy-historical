When you make a purchase from the Online Subway Store, our affiliate the Franchisee Shipping Center Co., Inc. will also collect your street and billing addresses, your phone number, and credit card information. Depending on what you purchase, we may also need to collect other personal information, like your clothing size.

If you fill out a job application, we will also forward your job application information to the party or parties that you specify.

Information Collected using Technology

We may collect some information about you using technology, so it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being collected.

An IP address is often associated with the place from which you enter the Internet like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your school. This information is not personally identifiable. We may use information collected through technology to make our sites more interesting and useful to you. We normally don’t combine this type of information with personally identifiable information. However, we may combine this information with personally identifiable information to identify a visitor in order to enforce compliance with our terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers, or others.
