# Official SUBWAY.com Privacy Policy

This privacy policy discloses how Doctor’s Associates Inc. collects, protects, uses and shares information gathered about you on our web site and the web site for the SUBWAY® Card. Currently, the SUBWAY® Card is being administered by Ontain Corporation on our behalf. We hope that this disclosure will help increase your confidence in our sites and our level of customer service. 

While visiting the SUBWAY® web site and the SUBWAY® Card web site you may be asked to provide information that personally identifies you. This information is gathered on a voluntary basis to better serve you.

You may choose not to provide personal information and you still will be able to visit most of the SUBWAY® web site but you will not be able to register your SUBWAY® Card at the SUBWAY® Card web site. Doctor’s Associates Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on the SUBWAY® web site and the SUBWAY® Card web site. We collect personal information at several different points on our Web site. The following items are a sample of areas in the SUBWAY® web site where personal information is required in order for us to assist you:

  * Job Opportunities with SUBWAY® franchised locations
  * Subscription to Friends of SUBWAY® e-mail newsletter
  * Request Information Concerning Purchase of a SUBWAY® franchise
  * Sign Up for a Free Seminar about SUBWAY® franchises
  * Prospective Landlord Site Referrals
  * Customer Service
  * Purchases from the Online SUBWAY® Store



**Information You Provide**

For the areas of the SUBWAY® web site where the collection of personally identifiable information is necessary, you will know because you will have to fill out a form. For most activities, we collect only your name and e-mail address. If you request a Franchise Brochure we will also need your address and telephone number to send you information about franchise opportunities. When you make a purchase from the Online Subway Store, our affiliate the Franchisee Shipping Center Co., Inc. will also collect your street and billing addresses, your phone number, and credit card information. Depending on what you purchase, we may also need to collect other personal information, like your clothing size. If you are participating in a contest we may also need to collect your shipping address to forward any prize won to you. If you fill out a job application, we will also forward your job application information to the party or parties that you specify. Additionally, we will forward customer complaints or feedback concerning specific restaurants, to the owner(s) of the SUBWAY® restaurant. Otherwise, we do not provide your information to third parties. You may unsubscribe from all SUBWAY® mailing lists at any time.

If you fill out an Application for Additional Information to become a SUBWAY® franchisee, we will seek extensive additional personal information. Such information will be used solely for the purpose of determining your qualifications to become a SUBWAY® franchisee. 

If you have not opted out of receiving marketing materials, we may also use, but will not disclose, your personal information to promote and market additional goods, services and special offers from us and our affiliates.

You can choose not to allow us to use or disclose your personal information for direct marketing purposes by indicating your preference at the time of collection, by responding to the promotional email in the manner provided for or by contacting our Privacy Officer in the manner described below.

Typically, we will seek consent for the use or disclosure of your personal information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when we want to use information for a purpose not previously identified).

The form of consent that we seek, including whether it is express or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of the individual in the circumstances. 

You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. If you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, please contact our Privacy Officer in the manner described below. We will inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent.

We will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes for which the information is being provided.

**Information Collected using Technology**

When you visit the Web site, we may collect some information about you using technology, so it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being collected. For instance, when you come to our site your IP address is collected so that we know where to send information you are requesting. An IP address is often associated with the place from which you enter the Internet like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your school. The following information is logged by our web servers during visits to the Web site: IP addresses, type of operating system, time and duration of visit, web pages visited and browser type. We do not link server log information to any other information in a way that would enable the identification of visitors to the Web site. Server log information is analysed by us in order to improve the website and to customize the website for users. In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes; for example, to detect unauthorized activity on the website. In such cases, server log data, containing IP addresses, would be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities. 

**Cookies**

When you visit our Web site, we place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser directory of your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. These pieces of information allow the Web site to remember important information that will make your use of that site more useful. Internet companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. We use cookies to help improve your future visits.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won’t have access to many features that make your experience on our web site more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.

**SUBWAY® Card Program**

Holders of SUBWAY® Cards may voluntarily register their cards through the SUBWAY® Card web site, by mail, or by telephone. If you choose to register your card, we collect personal information including your card number, name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and date of birth. Your purchase history may also be linked to this information. We use this information as part of our Lost/Stolen Card Program and to provide you with targeted offers from us, the SUBWAY® restaurants that you dine at, or from selected third parties, i.e. suppliers of products offered through the SUBWAY® system whose offers we will forward to you. If you do not wish to receive promotional materials with your use of the SUBWAY® Card you may update your preferences at www.mysubwaycard.com, call us at (800) 888-4848, or write to us at Subway Global HQ, Customer Care, 325 Bic Drive, Milford, CT 06460.

Please read the privacy policy of any third party site before providing them with any personal information.

**A Note to Parents/Guardians**

While we are very happy to have you visit the SUBWAY® web site with your children, the SUBWAY® web site and the SUBWAY® Card web site are general audience sites that are not designed nor intended to collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

We would like to help you protect your children’s privacy. Please speak with your children about the importance of safeguarding their personal information. We urge you to monitor and supervise your children’s on-line activities. At the SUBWAY® Card website we do not accept any information from children under the age of 13 and we ask that a parent or guardian register any card purchased for a child under the age of 13 in their parent’s or the guardian’s name.

**Disclosure and Sharing of Personal Information**

Except as described in this privacy policy, we will not disclose your personal information to a third party, unless you request or otherwise consent to such disclosure or disclosure is required or authorized by law. 

We may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist us in providing services to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described in this privacy policy. Our service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance and are required to protect personal information disclosed by us and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this privacy policy.

Although we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information as follows:

> **(i)** when required by law to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order, or legal process served on us;
> 
> **(ii)** to enforce our policies or agreements including the collection of amounts owed to us;
>

**Changes**

In the future, we may modify this privacy policy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. However, if we are going to use personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communications with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will we use their personal information in this new manner.
