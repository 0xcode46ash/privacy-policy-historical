Your privacy is very important to us.  This Privacy Policy discloses how Doctor’s Associates Inc. (“DAI”) and its affiliates collect, protect, use and share personal information gathered about you, in conformance with the applicable law. All personal information is collected in a fair and non-intrusive manner, with your voluntary consent. Personal Information is not accessible to anyone outside the specific function for which it is collected.  DAI respects the privacy of employees and job applicants, franchisees, development agents, Subway® customers and other visitors to our websites who may choose to provide personal information.  We recognize the need for appropriate protection and management of personal information that you provide to us.  This Privacy Policy will assist you to understand what types of information we may collect, how that information may be used, and with whom the information may be shared.

In an effort to comply with the law, and our commitment to protect your personal information, we provide the following, which discloses our policies. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not govern the privacy policies and procedures of DAI’s independently owned and operated SUBWAY® stores. 

**What type of information do we collect?  
**Personal Information is any information concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. 

Personal Information shall include but is not limited to: identifying information such as name, home address, home telephone number, e-mail address, Social Security number, financial information and employment-related information such as may be found on resumes, applications, background verification information, or in employment references.  

DAI takes measures to maintain the confidentiality of your Social Security Number, to protect your Social Security Number from unlawful disclosure, and to limit access to your Social Security Number.  DAI will not make your Social Security Number available to the general public, print your Social Security Number on any card, require you to provide your Social Security Number to access any products or services, transmit your Social Security Number over the Internet unless the connection is secure or your Social Security Number has been encrypted, or require the transmittal of your Social Security Number to access our Website without requiring additional authentication.

We will not collect Sensitive Personal Information, except to comply with Affirmative Action data requirements.  Sensitive Personal Information can include but is not limited to: information pertaining to gender, disabilities and veteran status. 

**Cookies – Internet Users  
**In addition to Personal Information, we use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain web pages to help analyze our web page flow and measure promotional effectiveness. Cookies are pieces of information a website sends to an individual’s hard drive while they are viewing the website. Cookies allow the website to remember important information that will make your visit to the site more useful. We use cookies to help improve your future visits. If you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or if you wish to turn off all cookies, use the options on your browser to assist you. The “Help” option on your browser may assist you in changing your cookie preferences. Please note that by turning cookies off, you will not have access to many features available on our website.

**Children and Data Collection  
**DAI adheres to the federal privacy protection standards as stated in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).  We care about the safety of children. We will not knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information. Children under 13 years of age are required to obtain the express permission of a parent or guardian before submitting any Personal Information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail address, and phone number) over the Internet.  If a child has provided us with personally-identifiable information without the consent of a parent or guardian, the parent or guardian of that child should contact the Privacy Officer immediately at [ privacyofficer@subway.com](mailto:privacyofficer@subway.com). We will use reasonable efforts to promptly delete the child's information from our servers.

**A Special Note about Children who reside in the State of Maine, USA  
**DAI adheres with the Maine state law titled "An Act To Prevent Predatory Marketing Practices against Minors". The law applies to the collection and use of personal information for marketing purposes of children who are under the age of 18.  DAI’s website [ www.subway.com](http://www.subway.com/) is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 18 years of age. It is possible that due to fraud or deception by others, we may unknowingly receive information pertaining to children under 18 years of age. If this is the case, the parent or guardian of the minor must notify the Privacy Officer immediately at [ privacyofficer@subway.com](mailto:privacyofficer@subway.com). Once we have verified the accuracy of the information received by the parent or guardian regarding the child under 18 years of age, we will promptly delete the child’s information from our servers. 

**Our Use of Your Information  
**We use your Personal Information to facilitate the services you request. We have tailored our Privacy Policy to adequately inform you of the use of your Personal Information. 

**Collection and Use of Employee Personal Information  
**DAI also collects Personal Information from its employees and applicants (human resource data) in connection with administration of its Human Resources programs and functions.  These programs and functions include, but are not limited to: job applications and hiring programs, compensation and benefit programs, performance appraisals, training, access to DAI facilities and computer networks, employee profiles, internal intranet employee directories, Human Resource recordkeeping, Affirmative Action data, and other employment related purposes.

It is the policy of DAI to keep all past and present employee information private from disclosure to third parties. There are certain business related exceptions and they are: 

  1. To comply with county, state or federal agency requests; 
  2. Inquiries from third parties with a signed authorization from the employee to release the information, except in situations where limited verbal verifications are acceptable (see below);
  3. Third parties with which DAI has contractual agreements to assist in administration of company sponsored benefits. 



**Verifications of Employment  
**Prospective employers, state agencies, financial institutions, and residential property managers routinely contact DAI requesting information on a former or current employee's work history and salary. All such requests of this type shall be referred to and completed on a confidential basis by the Human Resources Department or Payroll Department. 

For written verification of employment requests, information will be provided on the form only when it is accompanied by an employee's signed authorization to release information. The form will be returned directly to the requesting party and filed as part of the Human Resources or Payroll Department’s confidential records.

**Medical Information  
**DAI is compliant with federal HIPAA regulations and only utilizes information related to the company sponsored healthcare plan on a "need to know" basis for administration of the healthcare plan.

A franchisee and prospective franchisee’s information may be shared with the Development Agent in their area. A Development Agent is an independent contractor of DAI or one of its affiliates.
