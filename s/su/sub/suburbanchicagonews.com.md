**Privacy Policy**

This "Web Site" is sponsored and hosted by Digital Chicago, Inc. Click here for a list of the Web Sites governed by Digital Chicago's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use (collectively, "Digital Chicago" or "we" or "us"). Digital Chicago respects the privacy of its users. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use your information, and your choices. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected by Digital Chicago at its Web Sites, and does not cover any information collected offline or elsewhere by Digital Chicago (unless specifically stated), Hollinger International, its or their affiliates or any other company. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review our [Terms of Use,](https://web.archive.org/web/20040415101656id_/http%3A//www.suburbanchicagonews.com/aboutus/terms.html) which governs your use of Digital Chicago's Web Sites. Your use of our Web Site indicates to us that you have read and accept our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

**_Information Digital Chicago Collects_**

**Personally Identifiable Information:** We may ask you to provide us with personal information about yourself, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your name, address, or e-mail address), which we refer to as "PII," at various times and at various places on this Web Site, such as when you register for newsletters, subscribe for home delivery, or choose to participate in a contest, sweepstakes or survey. We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information or information regarding your interests, hobbies or similar information. In addition, as part of our current and planned services, we may, at any time, add features to our Web Site that require you to register or otherwise provide PII, including credit card information, or we may require registration or a subscription fee to gain access to any portion of our Web Site. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in many of the Web Site's features. If you provide us with PII of a friend, such as name or e-mail address, (for example, in order to e-mail an article to a friend), or a friend has provided such information about you, we will not use such PII to send additional marketing materials. 

We may combine the information about you that we collect at our Web Sites with information available to us from other sources, including information received from promotional partners or other third parties. We may also combine any PII with other information we collect on our Web Site, including cookies and search terms users enter on our Web Site, which we may use for internal reporting and monitoring, improving our Web Site and products, or to target advertising.

**Digital Chicago does not knowingly collect information from children under thirteen (13) years of age:** This is not a web site directed to children under the age of 13, and Digital Chicago does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, do not send any information about yourself to Digital Chicago. If Digital Chicago discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided Digital Chicago with PII, Digital Chicago will delete that child's PII from its system. 

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information:** When you visit this Web Site, our servers automatically collect certain web site usage information. Web site usage information is non-identifying information that describes how our visitors use and navigate our Web Site, and it includes the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stays. We also collect the information automatically sent to us by your browser, such as browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Web Site, and IP address. We also may determine the technology available through your browser in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page. 

**Cookies:** Like most web sites, this Web Site sometimes makes use of browser "cookies." Digital Chicago does not save PII in cookies, but we may link the cookie to any PII or other information we collect. In addition, we or our third party advertising networks may use cookies in connection with the serving of advertisements. For example, cookies may be used to control the number of times a user sees a particular advertisement or to target an advertisement to those users that will likely be the most interested in it. We do not have access to cookies set by third parties or the information that they may contain. 

**Web Beacons.** Our web pages or e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a web beacon, which is sometimes also called a "web bug" or "clear gif", and which allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain limited information about the viewer of the web page or e-mail message (such as the type of browser downloading the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed, as well as the URL of the page the web beacon comes from). Web beacons are typically very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel) and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail message, including an advertisement or HTML content, can act as a web beacon. Digital Chicago may use web beacons for a number of purposes, such as to count visitors to our web pages or to monitor how our users navigate our site, and we may include web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters in order to count how many newsletters (or particular articles, links, etc.) we sent were actually opened. Digital Chicago does not link the information collected by its web beacons to your PII. In addition, third parties that serve ads or content onto this Web Site or within our emails may use web beacons. Digital Chicago does not have control over web beacons used by such third parties and does not have access to whatever information they may collect. 

**_Third Party Advertisements and Content_**

When you are on our Web Site, certain content, including advertisements, may be created or hosted by a third party. Such third parties may drop cookies and/or use web beacons, which may be used to identify some of your preferences or to recognize you if you have previously had contact with them. In addition, we use third party advertising networks to serve ads on our Web Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, [click here.](http://www.247realmedia.com/privacy.html) Some of the content or ads served to you by a third party and/or third party advertising network may contain cookies or web beacons that are set by those third parties. We do not control the use of such technology by third parties, the information they collect, or how they use such information. Digital Chicago does not disclose your PII to third parties serving ads or other content on this Web Site in connection with the serving of such content. 

**_Digital Chicago's Use and Disclosure of Collected Information and Your Choices_**

**Use by Digital Chicago:**

Digital Chicago may use your PII to provide you with requested goods, services or content, to contact you in connection with a sweepstakes or promotion, or for other purposes disclosed when you provide your PII. In addition, we will send you special offers via email if you indicate that you would like to receive such information when you register with us. If you wish to unsubscribe from our e-mail newsletter or change the information you receive, [click here.](http://www.suburbanchicagonews.com/forms/headlines.html)

We may also contact you regarding any problems or questions we have relating to your use of our Web Site, or, in our discretion, notify you of changes to our Privacy Policy, Terms of Use or other policy or terms that affect you and your use of our Web Site. Digital Chicago may also use information collected about our users to provide customized content, advertising, products and services, or to improve the content and navigation of our Web Site, or for other internal purposes. In addition, while you are on our Web Site, we may use demographic and preference information to allow advertisements on our Web Site to be targeted to the users most interested in them. 

If you submit a letter to the editor or other content to be published in one of our publications, whether such publication originates online or offline, we may publish your name or other information in connection with publishing the letter to the editor or other content.

**Sharing User Information and Disclosure to Third Parties:**

Unless otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy or at the time you provide your information, Digital Chicago will only share your PII with third parties under the following limited circumstances:

**Affiliates.** Digital Chicago reserves the right to share your information with and among the Digital Chicago Web Sites, as well as with our parent and affiliated companies.

**Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions.** If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, your PII may be disclosed to third parties in connection with such promotion at least as required by law, including, without limitation, on a winners list. Also, by entering a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, we may require you to consent to the use of your PII or other information, such as voice or likeness, in advertising, promotional and marketing materials. In addition, we may offer certain promotional content, such as a sweepstakes, sponsored by or co-branded with a third party, who may obtain the PII that you submit, but only where specifically stated on the registration page for such promotion. Please note that Digital Chicago has no control over such a third party's use of this information, and any such third party is not subject to this Privacy Policy.

**Third parties providing services on our behalf.** Digital Chicago may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on its behalf. Examples include, without limitation, fulfilling orders, sending communications on our behalf (including our e-mail editions), analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, creating, hosting and/or running contests/sweepstakes/games and providing customer service. These third parties may have access to our users' PII in order to provide these services to us or on our behalf.

**Legal action.** Digital Chicago may disclose information about its users, including PII, when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, or to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Web Site and applicable laws. Digital Chicago may also disclose user information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability or to protect or enforce the rights, interests or safety of the Web Site, our users or others.

**Corporate change.** Digital Chicago may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose user information, including PII, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of substantially all assets, or other fundamental corporate change.

**Aggregate information.** Digital Chicago may disclose non-identifying, aggregated user statistics to third parties for a variety of purposes, including describing Digital Chicago's services, marketing, and providing a better user experience on the Web Site. 

**_Security_**

We store the information we collect from you on limited access servers, and we take steps to maintain the security of our servers and to protect your PII from unauthorized disclosure. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Digital Chicago cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Digital Chicago and you do so at your own risk. 

**_Links_**

Please be aware that when you are on our Web Site or viewing an email from Digital Chicago, you could be directed to other web pages or online content through links that take you outside our service and are beyond our control. For example, you may encounter links from sponsors or partners, which may include Digital Chicago's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. If you "click" on a link to such a third party, the "click" takes you to a third party's web site. These other web sites may set their own cookies, collect data, and/or have their own privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected by Digital Chicago on our Web Site, and we encourage you to review the privacy policy of any other web site you visit. 

**_Consent to Transfer_**

This Web Site is operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using our Web Site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.

**_Acceptance Of Terms_**

By using this Web Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. **Digital Chicago reserves the right to modify, alter or otherwise update this Privacy Policy at any time.** We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back from time to time. Of course, unless you consent otherwise, Digital Chicago will use your PII consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time you submitted your PII.

**_Contact Us_**

If you have any questions, comments or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at [jwcary@suntimes.com](mailto:jwcary@suntimes.com).
