OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT   
Subaru Canada, Inc. ("Subaru") values its relationship with you, our existing or potential customers, suppliers, employment applicants, dealers and partners, and is committed to maintaining the security, confidentiality and privacy of your personal information. Subaru has developed a **Personal Information Privacy Policy** incorporating the principles set out below, to reflect its on-going commitment to you. Subaru has ensured that its Privacy Policy is in compliance with Canadian privacy laws which apply to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. 

  
**"Personal Information"** as used in this Privacy Policy means information about an identifiable individual. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the collection, use or disclosure of business contact information (for example the name, title, business address and telephone number of an employee of an organization), to Subaru's employees, or in part to certain publicly available information.

Accountability for Subaru's compliance with its Privacy Policy rests with Subaru's _[Privacy Officer](http://privacy.mysubaru.ca/)_ , even though other individuals within Subaru may have responsibility for management of personal information or may be delegated to act on behalf of the Privacy Officer.

Subaru will be responsible for personal information in its possession or custody, and will also use reasonable contractual or other available means to provide a comparable level of protection when the information is being processed or managed by a third party on Subaru's behalf.

  
In general, Subaru has collected, and will continue to collect, use and disclose personal information for purposes authorized or required by law, as well as for the following purposes: 

    * to administer your transaction; 
    * to provide to you with products and services related to your current and future vehicles; 
    * to assist you to finance or lease vehicles; 
    * to administer customer notification programs; 
    * to evaluate your satisfaction with their products and services;
    * in accordance a consent you have provided us or our dealer on our behalf
    * to maintain accurate customer records to satisfy legal and industry-wide regulatory obligations
    * to make annual filings and reports with regulatory bodies, shareholders and creditors
    * to respond to your inquiries;
    * to distribute _Six Star Review, The Magazine for Canadian Subaru Owners_ and similar Subaru magazines and publications
    * to permit carefully selected third party providers of products and services related to your current and future vehicles to provide their goods and services to you, such as roadside assistance providers or satellite radio providers
    * to permit Subaru, our dealers and/or carefully selected third parties to contact you by mail, email, text, cell/telephone, or other means of telecommunication to provide you with news, information, updates, advertising, and promotions about products and services that may be of interest to you
    * to analyse the operations of dealers, suppliers and business partners
    * to allow you to participate in Subaru vehicle test drives
    * to share some of your information under strictly limited and confidential circumstances with our affiliates, dealers, representatives, suppliers and Subaru business partners such as the Canadian Automobile Association (CAA) who assist us in providing products and services and allow us to more effectively carry on our business
    * to establish, administer and document training, development and educational requirements and programs 
    * to establish, administer and document incentive programs 
    * to evaluate potential suppliers and their staff, make decisions about entering into product and/or supply relationships with them, and to monitor, assess and address these relationships 
    * to evaluate potential dealers and their staff, make decisions about entering into dealer relationships with them, and to monitor, assess and address these relationships 
    * to evaluate potential partners and/or co-suppliers and their staff, make decisions about entering into relationships with them, and to monitor, assess and address these relationships 
    * to implement and manage security programs and internal controls (including computer monitoring and video surveillance) 
    * to protect Subaru, and its customers, suppliers, dealers and partners, from theft, fraud and similar risks 
    * to assist dealers in carrying on their business and related products and services, such as warranty and non-warranty services for vehicles, vehicle parts, extended warranty arrangements and financing of vehicle purchases
    * if we engage a third party to provide services to us (such as marketing, IT or storage services)

  
The way in which Subaru obtains your consent to collecting, using or disclosing your personal information will vary depending upon its sensitivity and legal requirements. We may ask for your consent or our dealer may obtain a consent on our behalf. Your consent also may be implied or implicit through your conduct when it is reasonable and legally permissible for us to do so. 

We will honour any specific consents you provide to us regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information. You may withdraw or change your consents at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions, by giving to Subaru reasonable notice. In appropriate cases, Subaru will inform individuals of any implications of withdrawing consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Subaru reserves the right to retain, collect, use, and disclose your personal information and to contact you where Subaru is legally required or permitted to do so. 

Subaru will not, as a condition of the supply of services, require an individual to consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information beyond that required to fulfil the specified purposes. 

In certain circumstances as permitted or required by law, Subaru may collect, use or disclose personal information without the knowledge or consent of the individual. These circumstances include the following: to investigate a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a law; where collection or use is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way; for debt collection; to act in respect to an emergency that threatens an individual; or to comply with a subpoena, warrant or court order.

If you want to unsubscribe from Subaru and/or certain non-Subaru third parties contacting you by mail, email, text, cell/telephone, or other means of telecommunication to provide you with news, information, updates, advertising, and promotions about products and services that may be of interest to you, and/or correct your personal information, please click here  [privacy.mysubaru.ca](http://privacy.mysubaru.ca/)

  
Subaru will limit the amount and type of personal information collected to that which is necessary for the purposes of the collection. 

Personal information will be retained only as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes of the collection or as required or permitted by law, and at the end of such time will be destroyed or made anonymous. Personal information which has been used to make a decision about an individual will be retained long enough (for at least one year after using it) to reasonably allow the individual access to the information after the decision, and long enough to exhaust any access request or a challenge an individual may bring under applicable privacy laws.

  
All individuals generally have a right to access their personal information in Subaru's possession or custody. Upon receiving a written request (mail, e-mail or fax) addressed to Subaru's _[Privacy Officer](http://privacy.mysubaru.ca/)_ clearly identifying the requested information with adequate identification of the requesting individual, Subaru will inform the individual of the existence, use, and disclosure of the personal information and give the individual access to that personal information. If Subaru is not able to provide a list of the organizations to which it may have actually disclosed the personal information, it will provide a list of organizations to which it may have disclosed the information.

Subaru will respond to an individual's written access request, with information in a form that is generally understandable, within a reasonable time (generally within 30 days) or will provide an explanation if additional time is required to fulfil the request. Subaru's response will typically be provided for a minimal handling fee which Subaru reserves the right to vary depending on the nature of the request and the amount of information involved. Subaru will inform the individual of the approximate cost to provide the response, and will provide the information upon receipt of payment.

Individuals can question the accuracy and completeness of their personal information and request that it be amended as appropriate. If an individual demonstrates in a reasonable manner the inaccuracy or incompleteness of their personal information, Subaru will amend the information as required. If a request is not resolved to the satisfaction of the individual, Subaru will record the substance of the unresolved request. Where appropriate, the amended information or the existence of the unresolved request will be transmitted to third parties having access to the information in question.

In some situations, Subaru may be permitted to refuse or not be able to provide access to certain personal information, and will upon request provide an explanation. Exceptions to the access right which are permitted or required by applicable privacy laws include: information that contains references to other individuals or contains confidential commercial information (where such information cannot be severed from the record); information collected in the course of investigating a breach of an agreement or in the course of a formal dispute resolution process; and information that is subject to solicitor-client privilege.

If you need to obtain a copy of the form to be used to make access requests to Subaru for your personal information which Subaru may hold, please click here: [SCI Access Request Form](http://privacy.mysubaru.ca/requestPIEN.pdf)

  
Subaru will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the personal information it uses on an ongoing basis is accurate, complete and up-to-date as necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used, including information that is disclosed to third parties, and information that is used to make a decision about an individual.

  
Subaru protects the personal information it holds or controls, by establishing reasonable security arrangements against loss, theft, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, copying or modification. Subaru will make its employees aware of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of personal information, and will exercise care in the disposal or destruction of personal information. Examples of safeguards include physical measures (such as locked filing cabinets and access cards), organizational measures (such as security clearances and restrictions on employee access to files and databases) and technological measures (such as passwords and firewalls).

  
Subaru may transmit personal information outside of Canada, including to the United States, for processing by Subaru, its affiliates or third party service providers for some or all of the purposes described above. While outside of Canada, personal information may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities of the foreign jurisdiction. If you have questions about Subaru's policies and practices regarding the use of affiliates and service providers outside of Canada to collect, use, disclose, or store personal information, please direct them to Subaru's Privacy Officer at the contact information at the end of this Privacy Policy. 

Subaru will make the following readily available: general information concerning our Privacy Policy; how to gain access to your personal information; the type of personal information held by Subaru; a general account of the use and disclosure of the personal information; and how to contact our [Privacy Officer](http://privacy.mysubaru.ca/).

Since Subaru may review its policies and procedures, Subaru may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and the revised Privacy Policy will be effective on posting the revised Privacy Policy on our website with a note of the date the Privacy Policy was revised. It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly.

Subaru will, on request, provide information regarding its procedure for addressing any complaints made with respect to Subaru's application of privacy laws. Subaru will investigate all written complaints, and if it finds a complaint to be justified, Subaru will take the appropriate measures, including, if necessary, amending our policies and practices.

Please direct any questions about the complaint procedure or any other aspect of this Privacy Policy to Subaru's Privacy Officer at:
