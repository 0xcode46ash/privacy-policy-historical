# Privacy Policy — Subbable

When signing up for and logging into Subbable, we will ask you to sign up and log in using your Google Account. From that account, the only information we collect is:

We use that information to help you personalize your experience and to notify you about information relevant to your Subscriptions.

When you pay to Subscribe, your payment is processed securely through Amazon Payments, and Subbable never collects any personal or financial information directly from you based on that transaction.

Subbable will keep a record of how much you have spent and what, if any, perks you have ordered.

Subbable does not and will not sell, trade, or transfer your information to an outside party. We may provide your email address to Creators you have Subscribed to.
