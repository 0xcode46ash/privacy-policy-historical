**Cookies**

As part of our approach to providing personalized services on the Site, SugarCRM uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small data file sent to your browser from a web server to be stored on your hard drive that allows easier access the next time the same page is visited. For example, a cookie is sent when you register or sign in to this site. The use of cookies provides benefits to you, such as eliminating the need for you to enter your password frequently during a session, or where applicable re-enter items you place in a shopping cart from visit to visit if you do not finish a transaction on an earlier visit. For these purposes, our cookies are tied to personally identifiable information. 

If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you can configure your browser so that it notifies you whenever a cookie is received so you can decide each time if you accept them or not. However, the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain features and choosing to reject cookies may reduce the functionality of the site. Your browser help should include precise instructions explaining how to define the acceptance of cookies. 

**Aggregate Information**

The Site may track the total number of visitors to the Site, the number of visitors to each page of the Site, browser type, IP addresses, External Web Site(s) (defined below) linked to, and SugarCRM may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. SugarCRM may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

**Disclosure**

SugarCRM provides users’ personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that SugarCRM engages to assist in providing SugarCRM products and Services to users and our partner entities that are not within SugarCRM’s corporate family. For example, SugarCRM provides user’s personally identifiable information to a credit card processing company to process user’s payment or to SugarCRM subcontractors to assist with products and Services. These third party service providers are prohibited from using users’ personally identifiable information for their own marketing purposes. SugarCRM may also disclose users’ personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to parent, subsidiary and affiliate entities within SugarCRM’s corporate family. In addition, SugarCRM may disclose users’ personally identifiable information if SugarCRM reasonably believes we are required to do so by law to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, legal process, or regulation, other government authority and/or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights. 

SugarCRM will not sell a user’s personally identifiable information to any company or organization; except that SugarCRM may transfer a user’s personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which SugarCRM participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of SugarCRM's assets to which this Site relates.
