### The Information We Collect

The information gathered by [www.summerlinhospital.com](http://www.summerlinhospital.com/) generally falls into two categories: (1) information supplied by visitors to the site when they register or initiate transactions, and (2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through the uhsinc.com site. Third-party providers, whose sites are featured on and accessed via our site, may gather information as well.

The information you provide us helps us to respond to your expression of interest in employment. It also assists us in providing you with your requested physician referral, the programs and services available to those who sign up for Senior Advantage, and the conveniences associated with Regie, our on- line pre registration program.

If you submit an Application for Employment we require various demographic information including your name, age, address, telephone number; information about your work history, education, particular skills or training, honors and awards, and your professional licenses. We also ask for employment references, and your consent to various terms and conditions of employment.

If you complete our Senior Advantage Application form, we ask for demographic information including your name, address, telephone number, age, and date of birth. We also ask for your Social Security and Medicare Part A Claim numbers, and the identification of any supplemental insurance carrier. We discourage supplying us with your personal medical information on this form.

When you supply us with a Direct Doctors Plus Referral Request, we ask for various demographic information including your name, age, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and gender. We ask you whether you would like us to respond to your request by e-mail or phone, and we ask for an identification of your primary health insurance plan. Additionally we ask about your physician preferences for gender, specialty, and qualifications. Lastly, we ask for the name of your family doctor, a description of your specific medical concerns, and whether or not you have previously seen a physician about your concerns.

When you elect to pre register for hospital services by completing our Regie, on line registration form, we ask for much of the same personal information we request during registration at the hospital: Name and primary language of the patient; name of person completing the registration form and his/her relationship to the patient; whether the patient has an advance directive or a durable power of attorney; an identification of the health care services requested; identification of the patient primary care, and admitting physicians; name and address of employer; diagnosis or the reasons for seeking treatment, a history of the patients prior hospital admissions; name, address, telephone and social security number(s), occupation, and employer of person responsible for paying the bill; emergency contact information; and an identification of the primary and secondary insurance plans of the person responsible for paying the bill.

### Email Addresses

If you provide us your email address, from time to time we may send you emails about job opportunities with our company that we believe will interest you. We will not share your email address with providers of products or services. If you do not wish to receive email about job opportunities, please indicate when you give us your email address that you'd prefer not to receive such information. If you provide us with your e-mail address, we may also use your email address to answer any email you send us, or to follow up on your visit concerning Senior Advantage, Direct Doctors Plus Referral, or Regie, our on-line pre registration program. Such follow-ups may include inquiries on transactions or submissions of information that appear incomplete.

### Browser Level Information

Our Web server automatically collects your IP address when you request pages from our server. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell us who you are. We also collect information on the operating system you're running on your computer and the Web browser software you're using to access our site so we can optimize our site for the most popular operating systems and Web browsers. And, because we like to know how you found our site, we keep track of where you came from.

### Pop-up Surveys

This site does not presently employ pop-up ads, nor do we request information from users for surveys.

### Information Collected by Third Parties

Our site may include links to other Web sites, and provide access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don't control. When you access another Web site or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through our Web site, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting or the provider of such products or services. The provider's privacy practices may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of our provider partners via a link either from the site's home page or from the pages on which the products or services are offered, you should contact the provider directly for more information.

### Security

Generally, the information we collect from our visitors is stored in databases we control. Physical access to the servers on which we store visitor information is restricted. We don't share your personal information with anyone, except as may be necessary to verify your education, experience, and other qualifications for employment.

Pre-Registration Information: To protect the privacy of your personal information, we encrypt this information for transit over the Internet using a Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") connection. The personal information you submit in order to pre-register at our hospital for treatment and/or tests is stored on a single server to which access is restricted to authorized hospital personnel. Once retrieved from the server data base, these personnel will enter your personal information into the hospital's computer system, to which access is restricted.

On Line Employment Application: We collect employment related information in one of two ways. After acquiring a user name and password, you may submit an Application For Employment in pdf format. That information is stored on a server maintained by our internet service provider who e-mails the document containing your employment related information to personnel in the hospital's Human Resources Department specifically Authorized to access it. In the alternative, the hospital may maintain a Profile form which you would complete and submit via a secure internet connection directly to the hospital's Human Resources Department. There personnel authorized to access that information review it, and follow up if warranted.

Senior Advantage Discount Program: If you submitted an application for the benefits of this Program, you completed and submitted a form with personal information over a secure ("SSL") internet connection to a server maintained by our internet service provider where it remains encrypted until submitted to authorized, hospital personnel who decrypt it for follow up.

Direct Doctors Referrals: In this instance the personal information contained in your application for a physician referral is submitted over a secure connection to a server maintained by our internet service provider. Over this secure connection, it is accessed by authorized personnel and used to follow up.

Information you submit through use of your own e-mail program is not secure. As effective as modern security practices are, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet.

Additionally, please note that most web browsers allow use of an SSL connection. If your browser does not support use of an SSL connection, or if you prefer not to send your personal information over the Internet, you can mail it to the appropriate address noted on the [Employment page](http://www.summerlinhospital.com/Employment/Employment) of this web site.

### Disclosure of Information

The personal information supplied by applicants for employment is shared selectively with individuals in the Human Resources Department of the hospital, and it may be shared as well with recruiting and hiring managers in our home office, and at our affiliated hospitals who have a business reason to know of the information because of their assigned duties.

Information collected in our on-line pre registration program, Regie, is collected in a central and from where it is delivered to the hospital, and accessed by the admitting staff with specific duties and responsibilities for registration of patients.

Personal information acquired in the Senior Advantage program is collected in a central server, and distributed to authorized Senior Advantage personnel at the hospital. It is also shared with authorized Senior Advantage personnel for each of the other hospitals comprising the Valley Health System.

Information we gather for Direct Doctors Plus Referral is also collected in a central server and distributed to selected personnel in the direct doctors program of the Marketing Department at our home office. After the referral is made, the material is secured and not generally shared any further.

Additionally, we may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, our customers, the public or Universal Health Services. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that Universal Health Services, one of its affiliated units, or substantially all of its assets are acquired by another company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred assets.

### Retention of Information

The information submitted through this site is retained in accordance with state and/or and federal laws, and document retention policies of this hospital and/or its parent company.
