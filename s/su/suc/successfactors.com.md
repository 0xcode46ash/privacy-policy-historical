#### Privacy Policy of SuccessFactors

SuccessFactors has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy and security. Privacy and security on the performancemanager.successfactors.com web site (the "Site") is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our customers, we have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this Statement and will provide notification of the change at least thirty (30) business days prior to the change taking effect.

##### Collected Information

In general, you can visit our Web site without giving SuccessFactors any personal information. There are cases, however, where SuccessFactors may ask you for personal information. For example, we do this when you request information or when you register for an event. This information may include such information as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number or company information. This information is used to contact you with marketing or promotional information from us.

We require users of the services ("Services") offered on our Site to give us information, such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. SuccessFactors uses the information that we collect to set up Services for individuals and their organizations. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with any third parties.

Except as we explicitly state in the SuccessFactors Subscription Service Agreement, we do not disclose to any third-party the information provided. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the web Site but they are not permitted to collect any information nor does SuccessFactors share any user information with these parties.

Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data and information ("Data"). SuccessFactors will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as provided in the SuccessFactors Subscription Service Agreement, or as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the Subscription Service Agreement, or as may be required by law. Customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password.

##### Cookies

When you interact with the SuccessFactors Website we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to our Web site, our Web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers have visited the Site previously.

Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Cookies come in two flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.

SuccessFactors uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in. This information allows SuccessFactors to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are required in order to use the SuccessFactors application. SuccessFactors uses persistent cookies, that only SuccessFactors can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a SuccessFactors customer. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Website but will not be able to successfully use our service.

##### Third-Party Sites

The Site may contain links to other web sites. SuccessFactors is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other web sites. Customers and visitors will need to check the policy statement of these others web sites to understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information. It is the responsibility of the user to keep such information private and confidential.

##### Security

Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. When our Site is accessed using Netscape Navigator, or Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.0 or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that Data is safe, secure, and available only to you. SuccessFactors also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Site in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, SuccessFactors offers unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.
