# SuccessFactors Privacy Policy

## Introduction

SuccessFactors recognizes the need for appropriate protections and management of your personal information that you provide to us. We are committed to the highest standards in protecting and safeguarding your right to privacy while using and interacting with our Web site. SuccessFactors has therefore established this Privacy Policy to assist you to understand how SuccessFactors collects and uses personally identifiable information about our customers collected on the SuccessFactors Web site. By using our Web site or providing any personal information using our Web site, you are agreeing to the collection and use of information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.

While you can access most areas of our Web site without submitting any personal data, there are certain areas of our site that request specific personal information including name, phone number, and e-mail address. Our intent is to allow you as much control as possible over your personal information.

### Data Collection Overview

Our server software gathers in log files, general demographic information from all users of our Web sites. For each visitor to the SuccessFactors Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes the visitor's domain name, browser type, operating system, referring domains, entry page, exit page, and average time on the Web site. This information is used for internal purposes only in helping us improve our Web site and helps us understand our visitors' needs.

We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of marketing companies to help us collect and/or log Internet Protocol addresses, Internet domain names, the web browser and operating system used to access the SuccessFactors Web site, the files visited, the time spent in each file, and the time and date of each visit. We use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing companies. Cookies are identifiers that can be sent from a Web site via your browser to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Thereafter when you visit a Web site, a message is sent back to the Web server by the browser accessing the Web site.

We use cookies to personalize the experience of our visitors, provide support to customers, record visitor preferences, provide personalized and specialized content, record session information, track visitor clickstream behavior throughout the Web site, and customize site content based on your browser type, operating system, and preferences. By gathering such information to supplement our records, we learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing companies log the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can opt-out" of this Web site analysis tool by disabling your cookie.

If you choose to receive company or product information, you will need to complete our online request forms. The online forms provide site visitors with an opportunity to request product downloads and demos, view SuccessFactors white papers, register for free SuccessFactors online seminars, and enroll for various services. These forms require your name, company name, e-mail address, company address, phone number as well as other information to help us determine and respond to your needs related to the products and/or services requested.

We may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on our Web site in which we ask persons who choose to participate for contact information (like an e-mail address) or demographic information (like a zip code, industry or country). We may use the data we collect from you in these contests and promotions to send you promotional material about our company or our partners. Your contact information collected from these contests and promotions may be used to administer the contest and notify winners and contact you when necessary.

From time to time, we may share your e-mail address with our partner organizations and companies for service, sales, support, and marketing purposes. If you do not wish to receive marketing e-mail from us or our partners in the future, you may opt out as described below.
