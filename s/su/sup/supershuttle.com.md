# Welcome to SuperShuttle.com

At SuperShuttle, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information you provide to secure your SuperShuttle reservation. 

At some point in the future, we may use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new SuperShuttle services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If we do so, you'll be provided an opportunity to unsubscribe from this mailing list. 

SuperShuttle does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We may choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, but you can tell us not to by sending a blank e-mail message to [never@supershuttle.com](mailto:never@supershuttle.com) from the email you'd like removed. In addition, we also may market certain third party services through our site. If you accept the offer, we will pass your relevant personal information, including name and credit/debit card number to that third party. If you have previously requested that your personal information not be shared with third parties, but then later consent by accepting a third party marketing offer available through our site, we will share your contact and billing information with that specific third party. 

Also, SuperShuttle may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. SuperShuttle may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of SuperShuttle.com, our users, or others.
