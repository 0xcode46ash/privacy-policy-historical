## Privacy Policy

**Westlake Products, Inc. Privacy Policy - June 2007**

Westlake Products, Inc. (the "Company") respects your privacy. In that regard, we have created this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect when you visit our site, why we collect it, and how it is used. By using this Web site, you consent to the data practices prescribed in this Privacy Policy. The Company's Privacy Policy governs the privacy guidelines for the Company's Web site at https://www.luckysearch.com (the "Site"). Terms capitalized herein but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Company's [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/super_points/tos). 

### What information does the Company collect?

"Personal Information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, first and last name, home or other physical address, credit card information, an email address, phone number, or other contact information, whether at work or at home. 

In a few areas on our Site, in providing the Services and online customer support tools, we ask you to provide Personal Information that will enable us to enhance your use of the Site or for purposes such as facilitating correspondence with you, registering your entitlement to access certain special features of the Site, or to complete transactions. It is always your choice whether or not to provide that Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Site. 

For example, when you use the referral features of the Site (the "Referral Program"), we may ask you to provide information such as your email address and your user and/or password information at another website or service. This will allow us to access your friends' email addresses. In return, you and your friends will be given the opportunity to make purchases or take advantage of other Company offerings, and make referrals to their friends. The emails your friends receive in this regard will be sent by us on your behalf. This feature helps us spread the word about our offerings. During and after participation in the Referral Program you and/or your friends may receive additional communications from us or our vendors in relation to the Referral Program and you and/or your friends' participation in it. We may use the data we collect in connection with these communications for the operation and ongoing maintenance of the Referral Program and the services we offer through the Site. You and your friends may opt-out of participation in the Referral Program at any time via opt-out links in all communications made to you and your friends through the Referral Program or by logging into your account and clicking on the "help & support" link at the bottom of the page and stating your request in the form provided. 

We may also automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, which could include your IP address, cookie information, browser information, and the page you request. 

### How does the Company use Personal Information?

Among other things, we want to help you quickly find information on our Site and alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new products and services from the Company. The Company may enhance or merge your information with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you. 

Periodically, we may send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. These mailings may be sent electronically or in physical form. Only the Company (or agents or contractors working on behalf of the Company and under confidentiality agreements, or other Members) will send you these mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your Personal Information. Or, at any time you can easily opt-out of receiving further marketing from the Company by contacting us and requesting to have your name removed from our marketing lists. In addition, with respect to mailings sent via email, you may also click the "unsubscribe" link in the email to have your email address removed from our marketing list. All requests to unsubscribe will be handled in a prompt and efficient manner and in accordance with applicable law.

This information is collected to help improve website flow and usability. In addition, we track click-through information, including IP addresses, to our Site from the reports and emails we sent to our customers.
