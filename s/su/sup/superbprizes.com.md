If you choose to use our services, we may require you to provide information as indicated on the forms throughout the Site. 

**Ad Serving Partners**   
Website operators that license our ad serving technology pass information to us so that we may serve relevant advertisements to you. 

**Publisher Partners**   
When you complete a registration or offer form that is hosted by one of our website publisher partners on our behalf, the website publisher partner may submit all or a portion of the information that you submitted on the form to the Company.

We may receive information about you from third party marketing partners that provide us with consumer data.

_USE OF INFORMATION_

Our partners and we may link your name, address and email address to other information, such your web activity on this and other sites and past purchase information. By providing your personal information here, some of your future web activity will be known to our partners and us, and will be used to show you more relevant online advertisements. We may use the collected PII and Non-PII for any legally permissible purpose in our sole discretion, including but not limited to those explained below. 

**Relevant Ad Serving**   
We may serve advertisements to you based, in part, on your IP address, the demographic and geographic information you submitted to the Company during the website registration process, your web activity on this and other sites, and past purchase information about you that we obtain from affiliated entities and from third parties.

**Customized Offers/Pre-fill Offers**   
Our technology may select certain offers for you to view based on the information we have about you.

We may not show all of the pre-filled data fields to you. 

**Secondary offers**

The cost of the free reward is absorbed by the sponsoring companies featured on this site. Users who opt-in to the offerings from these companies are also electing to receive additional information from these companies. The companies may request additional demographic and/or personally identifiable information for their use in subsequent marketing and promotional activities. 

_CONSUMER CHOICES_

**Marketing Communications**   
By completing and submitting a registration form you are consenting to receive marketing communications from us and our third party marketing partners. If, after you have shared your information with the Company, you decide that you do not want to receive marketing communications from the Company and its third party marketing partners, you can discontinue the communications by [clicking here](http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) and following the opt-out instructions. If you have registered or submitted information under more than one e-mail account, you must submit separate unsubscribe requests for each account. 

Please note that under the CAN-SPAM Act, an advertiser is required to provide an opt-out mechanism for consumers to unsubscribe from future emails about the advertiser. Although not required to by law, many email marketers also include an opt-out mechanism to enable consumers to be removed from their mailing list. This has caused some confusion for consumers in opting out. The table below clarifies which opt-out mechanism you should use. 

| **To Receive No Further Emails...**|  **Opt-Out Mechanism to Use**  
---|---  
From the advertiser| Advertiser's  
From the email marketing company| Marketer's  
From the advertiser or email marketing company| Both
