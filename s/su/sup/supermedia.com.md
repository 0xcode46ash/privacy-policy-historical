This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 4, 2010, and was last updated April 22, 2010. Our business changes constantly. This Privacy Policy will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the version of the Privacy Policy containing such changes on This Website.

• Non-Personally identifiable information you knowingly Provide

You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide.

As you browse the site, our web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via web server logs, we monitor statistics such as: 

  * How many people visit our site 
  * Which pages people visit on our site 
  * From which domains our visitors come (e.g., aol.com) 
  * Which browsers people use to visit our site

**What about pages that ask for personal information?**  
When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific purpose, we use the information for that purpose (such as to provide the service or information the visitor has requested). For example, you may be asked to give us individual information to purchase a product or service, receive information and manage online account registration. The information may include your zip code, phone number, account number, billing account number, a credit card number, mother’s maiden name, e-mail address, organization URL, personal ID, password, security question & answer, registration code and mailing address. 

If you choose to use our Chat feature to receive online support, we may collect your email address, phone number, address, account number and/or customer number and any information you choose to submit that would allow us to resolve your issue. We would respond to you via the Live Chat dialogue box or via email depending on the issue and length of time required to resolve your concern.

**What happens to information when I fill out registration forms?**  
The registration forms request accurate contact information (like name and e-mail address) and preferences that help us better serve you.

Users are free to delete Web site cookies. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. To disable cookies, see "Setting Cookie Preferences" at the end of this policy. 

However, some Web sites and ad serving companies have the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion.

Your password is set at a minimum of six characters, which provides added protection for your personal information. On secured pages, this site uses SSL encryption of at least 256-bits. When we collect any sensitive data from you, such as credit card number, those pages will be encrypted. 

**  
What security measures are in place to restrict access to personal data?**   
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

There are a variety of security measures in place that limit internal access to data stored by This Website. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only and requires an employee to have a secure ID and password to access the information. In addition, logs are reviewed regularly to spot any inconsistencies. The Web site is continually updated with the latest known security patches that are periodically published by our system vendor. Any information that you give is password protected. For your protection, the system automatically locks out a user after 3 incorrect tries and after 20 minutes of idle time per secure session. If you forget your password, you will be prompted to supply your customer ID number and your password will be e-mailed to you. 

If you have any questions about security on This Website, you can send us an email at spinfo@SuperMedia.com or contact Client Care at 866-558-0400, Monday-Friday, 7am to 8pm CST.
