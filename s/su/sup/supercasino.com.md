We are regulated by the Alderney Gambling Control Commission and are registered with both the Bailiwick of Guernsey’s Data Protection Office and the Information Commissioner’s Office in the United Kingdom. Should we for any reason elect to change this Privacy Policy the changes will be posted here, so that you are always kept informed of how we collect and use the information, and when we may disclose it to others.

However, this information will only be used within the regulatory rules and guidelines that govern this site.

### 2\. Uses Made of the Information

2.1 Information held about you is used in the following ways:

2.1.1 To set up and look after your account (including checks made to age verify you and to guard against fraud);

2.1.2 By us to administer the Games you play, inform you if you have won a prize to inform you of a bonus awarded to you, and advise you how you can find out who has won a prize;

2.1.3 To build an accurate profile of you to try to ensure that the content on our website is presented in the most effective manner for you and your computer;

2.1.4 To contact you when we need to give you some information about your account or when we have an offer that you can use with your account;

2.1.5 We may also mention you in our promotional material or on the site if you win £10 or more. However, we would only ever mention an abbreviation of your name, your town and county. Your full name would never be used, nor any other information that could identify you without your permission.

2.1.6 Personal details collected about you when you visit this site may also be shared with the following: reputable marketing partners selected by us (but we will never share your data with a third party company for products not related to your account unless you have explicitly allowed us to); a reputable data storage company, with whom we will hold/store your data; any company that we may sell all or part of our business to; any competent legal, regulatory or law enforcement authority including the Alderney Gambling Control Commission and the UK Gambling Commission or the Financial Intelligence Service (FIS). In the case of a regulatory or legal authority, you will not be told of this disclosure or the reasons why and you'll be waiving any and all rights that you may have in connection with such disclosure.

2.2 To opt out of marketing you will need to change this option in the preferences section of your account after registration. We may share your information with other third parties only where it is necessary for the operation of your Account, for example, with any outsourced Data Storage Company, Call Centre agents who may need access to your Account, your bank and authentication agencies that carry out identity checks.  
Some Games may be offered from jurisdictions outside of the European Economic Area. If so, this will be made clear on the website. Some jurisdictions do not provide the protections offered by Data Protection Act 1998 and, if you choose to play such Games, you consent to the transfer and processing of your personal information in such countries.

2.3 In addition we may provide aggregate statistics about our sales, customers, traffic patterns and other site information to third parties, but these statistics will not include any information that could personally identify you.

2.4 We do need to reserve the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with applicable laws and to comply with requests from government bodies or regulators (such as the Alderney Gambling Control Commission), to operate our systems properly or to protect ourselves or our users. In particular we use third parties to validate your registration information, so occasionally we may have to share the info you give us to confirm your identity. This third party will check your details against their databases and will keep a record of this. They'll also keep your personal details and may use them in the future to assist other companies with identity verification. You need to agree to all of this as well as authorising us to confirm the accuracy of your details using government-issued ID. In addition, if you breach our terms and conditions, we may share your personal details with our professional advisers or other appropriate third parties.

### 3\. Access to Information

We have strict procedures covering the storage and disclosure of your information in order to prevent unauthorised access to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law. You are entitled to exercise your right to access the information held about you but we may ask for proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.

### 6\. General

On our website we have links to other websites - to point you in the direction of other information or advice. However, you need to be aware that these sites may have different security or privacy policies to us. We cannot be responsible for any information you give to them. Netplay TV Group Ltd is an Alderney based company. Although Alderney is in the Channel Islands it is not, by a strange quirk of history, part of the European Economic Area - so when you register with us you are accepting that your personal details will be sent out of the EEA. However, the authorities in Alderney make us stick to the same rigorous data protection standards as those in the UK. We in turn ensure that anyone we use to manage your data also sticks to data protection standards similar to those in the UK.

This privacy policy forms part of our website Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Alderney and subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of Alderney.
