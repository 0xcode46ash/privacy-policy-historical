There are a limited number of situations requiring us to disclose your personal information to others without first receiving your consent: (1) when ordered to do so by a subpoena or court order; (2) if you violate or breach an agreement with us; (3) if we believe conduct by you will harm the property or rights of Superfish; (4) under exigent circumstances to protect the physical safety of Superfish its employees, users, or the general public. 

Security Information  
Our site/service has physical, electronic, and managerial security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We take many measures to protect this information while it is stored: 

  * We monitor system and application activity logs to identify any unusual activity, from authorized or unauthorized individuals accessing our systems or making changes to stored information. We regularly perform preventative system maintenance and monitoring to ensure the security of our data systems.
  * Our employees sign confidentiality agreements and only our employees who need information to perform their job and who have passed background checks are granted access to personally identifiable information or any other confidential data.
  * Servers are divided such that critical machines, such as data storage, are not exposed to the web.



No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
