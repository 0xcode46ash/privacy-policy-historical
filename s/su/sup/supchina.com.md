# Privacy policy - SupChina

Welcome to the website and online service of Sup China Inc. and its affiliates, which own and operate Sup China (“Sup China,” “we,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy applies to our websites, including www.supchina.com (collectively, our “Service”). We provide this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information that apply to our Service, as well as your choices regarding the collection and use of information. Please take a few moments to read the sections below to make sure you understand our policies.

  1. **How We Collect and Use Information.**



Through our Service, we seek to provide information about China, Chinese culture, and the Chinese financial markets. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our [Terms of Use](http://supchina.com/terms-use-agreement/).

  2. **Types of Personal information you provide us directly.**



We may from time to time ask for personal information such as your name and email address if you sign up for the Sup China newsletter, email alerts or otherwise correspond with us (in which case we will also retain our responses).

  3. **Personal information we may receive from third parties.**



We may receive personal information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our website or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook, by “following,” “liking,” or adding the Sup China application to a third party social network, that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Sup China. This information could include, but is not limited to, an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to Sup China’s websites or Service.

  4. **Use of personal information.**



We may use the personal information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may also send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers that we believe may interest you. If you do not want to receive such email messages, we will give you the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your personal information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.
