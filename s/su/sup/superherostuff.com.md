# Safe and Secure Shopping Guarantee

### Our Online Privacy Policy

You know and trust SuperHeroStuff.com and we value your trust. We want you to know how we collect, use and protect information about our online guests. This privacy policy will tell you:

  * What information we collect.
  * How we may share information.
  * How you can limit our sharing of information.



**What information about guests do we collect?**  
We receive and may store any information you enter on our website or give to our website in any other way. For example, we collect information you provide when you place an order, register with us, send us an e-mail or call us, enter a sweepstakes, or enroll or participate in a club or service such as gift registries. This information may include: 

  * your name.
  * your mailing address.
  * your e-mail address.
  * your phone number.
  * your credit card number.
  * It may also include any other personal or preference information you provide to us.
  * It may also include information you submit about other people; for example, the name and address of a gift recipient.



We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through e-mail. This practice, called "phishing", is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond.

**Information from Other Sources**  
We may receive information about you from other sources. This may help improve the personalization of our service to you by providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you.

**Automatic Information**  
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our website. For example, we use "cookies" like many other websites. Through "cookies" we obtain information when your web browser accesses our website (see "What are 'Cookies' and how do we use them?" section below for details). There are utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously. Although we cannot provide you with a personalized experience or certain services at our website if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.

**What are "Cookies" and how do we use them?**  
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser.

The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our website's best features, so we recommend that you leave them turned on.

Cookies allow us to provide storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. In order to provide the best guest experience possible, we also use cookies for reporting and analysis purposes, such as how guests are shopping our website, performance of our marketing efforts and your response to those marketing efforts, and the delivery of relevant marketing messages to each guest. We may also use cookies to manage SuperHeroStuff.com banner advertisements displayed on other websites across the Internet.

**Does our website share information it receives?**  
We share information we collect at our website within the SuperHeroStuff.com family. The SuperHeroStuff.com family may use this information to offer you products and services that may be of interest to you.

**Eâ€“Mails**  
If you provide our website with your e-mail address, you may receive e-mails from us. If you do not want to receive marketing or promotional e-mails from us, please click here. You may still receive select e-mails from us if you have requested them through one of our site services such as eNewsletters, Weekly Ad Reminders, Gift Reminders, or Available to Order Notifications. You can discontinue these e-mails by canceling your subscription to these services. You may still receive e-mails from other members of the SuperHeroStuff.com family if they received your e-mail address from other sources or as a result of their transactions or experiences with you. Please call **1-866-787-4376** or contact us if you have further questions about our e-mail unsubscribe process.

**What about links to and from other websites?**  
Our website may offer links to other sites. Other sites have their own policies regarding privacy. If you visit one of these sites, you may want to review the privacy policy on that site. In addition, you may have linked to our website through another site. For example, in certain cases you may have linked to SuperHeroStuff.com.com through banner advertising on another site. In such cases the site you linked from may collect information from people who click on the banner or link. You may want to refer to the privacy policies on those sites to see how they collect and use this information.

**Security & Secure Sockets Layering (SSL)**  
Our website uses Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to encrypt your personal credit information, including your credit card number, before it travels over the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. Because we use SSL, placing an order online at our website is just as safe as giving your credit card number over the phone.

**Warning about Fraudulent E-mails**  
"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through e-mail.

**Safe Shopping Guarantee**  
Our security measures are designed to prevent anyone from stealing and using your credit card number. In addition, consumer protection laws protect you against the unauthorized use of your credit card. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, if your credit card is used without your authorization, your liability for those fraudulent charges cannot exceed $50. So, if someone steals your credit card or your credit card number, your liability is limited to $50 no matter how much the thief charges to your account. If your credit card provider does hold you liable for any part of this $50, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50. We will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at our website while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
