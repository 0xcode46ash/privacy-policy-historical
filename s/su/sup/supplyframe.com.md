### Privacy Policy

Privacy is very important to SupplyFrame. That's why our technology and the way we use it exceeds all the industry standards for protecting your privacy online. Through our services, we do not install software on users' computers, or track keystrokes. We do not collect personally identifiable information unless that collection it is clearly marked and you are given a choice to opt-out having the information stored.

Please feel free to view our Privacy Policy in detail below. If you have questions or concerns regarding our stance on privacy, please e-mail [privacy@SupplyFrame.com](mailto:privacy@supplyframe.com).

### Privacy Regarding Clients of SupplyFrame's Services

This document is intended to inform you, the end user, about how SupplyFrame handles information we process on behalf of our Web site owners, advertisers, and service providers who use our services (our "Clients") as part of our data analytics services and information we process for our network advertising services. This document also explains our own practices for our corporate Web site.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact our Privacy Officer at [privacy@SupplyFrame.com](mailto:privacy@supplyframe.com).

SupplyFrame reserves the right to change how we handle information we process on behalf of our Clients as well as our own practices in regard to SupplyFrame's services or corporate Web site.

### What Does SupplyFrame Do?

We provide data analysis and audience segmentation services based on information provided by our Clients regarding their customer interactions, including those on the Client's Web site or online advertisements. We create usage/behavior/interest-based categories called "segments". Segments are unique groups of users that are created using Client-defined criteria that enable the Client to selectively serve targeted advertisements and otherwise profile users of that Client's site(s) or advertisements. Our solution may include traffic pattern and behavioral trend evaluations to enhance the usefulness and marketing power of our customers. 

We may provide targeted advertising services using non-personal information that is gathered across multiple, unaffiliated Web sites that use our network. Much like our data analytic services provided for specific Web sites, we create network segments that are used to serve targeted advertisements and profile users in our network.

### What Information Do We Collect for Our Clients and How Do We Use It for Our Data Analytics Services?

Our Clients, and our own sites, may collect information about their customer interactions using cookies, action tags, and other methods. Cookies are small text files that identify your computer. Web site owners use cookies to, among other things, monitor site usage, customize site features, identify a user's computer operating system and browser, and complete transactions. An action tag (also known as a "clear gif" or "Web beacon") is a small, graphic image on a Web page that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a site by collecting the IP address of the computer that the tag is sent to, the URL of the page the tag comes from, and the time it was viewed. Tags also may be associated with cookie information.

A Client may provide information that it collects, including personally identifiable information, to SupplyFrame. We also may collect data on behalf of a Client using tags. Information that we collect and compile directly from users includes "clickstream" data such as behavioral data, IP addresses, log files, and other traffic data. We do not collect any personally identifiable information directly from any user, whether using cookies or action tags. As part of our analytics and segmentation services, we may place a cookie on your browser when you visit the Client's Web site or view an advertisement of the Client.

We use data that we collect on behalf of the Client, only to create segments and reports for the Client. Additionally, we make information that we receive from a particular Client available only to that Client.

We may provide our analytic or segmentation services to Clients that are network advertisers or service providers. Clients may use a process whereby data is collected over time and across the Internet to determine or predict user characteristics, behavior, or preferences typically for use in ad delivery (called "Online Preference Marketing" ["OPM"]). On behalf of and at the direction of an OPM Client, we may collect non-personal information that the Client may use for OPM purposes on behalf of its customers, including advertisers and Web site owners. OPM Clients are responsible for notifying you of these collection practices and making opt-out procedures available (if any).

A Client may correlate or merge information that we report to it with personal information already collected or accessible by that Client. On behalf of a Client, we may correlate or merge personal information provided by the Client with non-personal information that we collect for that Client. Our Clients are responsible for notifying you whether they correlate or merge personal information to non-personal information that they collect or that we or any other third party collects on their behalf.

SupplyFrame firmly supports and encourages our Clients to adopt privacy policies that fully inform the Client's customers or users about the Client's information collection practices and use of SupplyFrame's services. You should familiarize yourself with the privacy practices of any Web site you visit to understand what information the site collects, how the information is used, what choices you have, how to access the information, and how it is safeguarded.

### Do We Disclose or Permit Access to Our Client's Information?

We keep all data that we receive from and store for our Clients strictly confidential. We are contractually obligated to maintain such confidentiality. We do not permit access to the information except as directed by our Client.

### What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It for Our Network Advertising Services?

Separate from our data analytics services, we provide OPM or network advertising services. For these services, we use a process whereby data is collected over time and across the Internet to determine or predict user characteristics, behavior, or preferences typically for use in ad delivery. Our Web tags, beacons, or cookies may collect non-personal information that may be used for OPM purposes on behalf of our customers, including advertisers and Web site owners. SupplyFrame may use our analytic and segmentation services to create industry trend reports. These industry trend reports may be shared with clients or with the public. 

### Do We Disclose or Permit Sharing of Information That We Collect for Our Network Services?

The non-personal user information that we collect to create segments and profile information for our network service is only shared with a client. An OPM Client may share these segments in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Client's respective privacy policy and subject to such other contractual restrictions imposed by SupplyFrame. To provide our network advertising services, we do enable our customers to customize the segments and other user characteristics that they will use to serve and deliver advertisements. 

### How Do We Store Information?

SupplyFrame takes reasonable steps to assure that all Client information sent to us from our Clients is secured from unauthorized interception and to protect it from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction in storage while under our control. While we have taken efforts to guard information, we cannot guarantee that it will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.

### Links to Other Web sites

This Web site contains links to other Web sites that are not owned or controlled by SupplyFrame. Please be aware that we, SupplyFrame, are not responsible for those Web sites and those Web sites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. We recommend you examine the privacy statements posted on those other Web sites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personally identifiable information.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

SupplyFrame reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, notify you here, or by means of notice on our home page, or other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

### Legal and Other Disclosure

We may share personal information when we believe such action is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., legal process or a statutory authorization); to enforce or apply our customer agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for services; to protect our rights or property, or to protect users of those services from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such services; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of information without delay.
