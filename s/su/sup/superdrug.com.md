# Privacy Policy at Superdrug

## Introduction

Superdrug Stores plc are committed to protecting your privacy. 

Please read this policy carefully as it explains how we use your personal information. If you have any questions about or comments on this policy, please contact us at 0800 096 1055 before using this website.

We may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure you are happy with any changes. 

## What information do we collect and why? 

In general, you can visit our website without giving us any information and we won’t know who you are. If you are one of our anonymous visitors, please bear in mind that we may still:

  * Record the areas of the website which you visit; and ****
  * Collect information about your computer such as which browser you are using, your network location, the type of connection you are using (e.g. broadband, ADSL etc). ****



We do this by using Cookies, but we can’t tell who you are.

Additional services may be available if you register with our website (including if you register for our [Beautycard](http://www.superdrug.com/beautycard/introducing-the-superdrug-beautycard-your-new-shopping-essential/page/beautycard/)). In this case, once you register we will know who you are, and your activities on our website and information about your computer may be linked to you on our systems. You may also give us:

  * Contact information - your name, address, postcode, email address and telephone/mobile number;
  * General information about you - your interests, experiences with products and services and your contact preferences;
  * If you are registering as a [Beautycard](http://www.superdrug.com/beautycard/introducing-the-superdrug-beautycard-your-new-shopping-essential/page/beautycard/) member, information to help us send you the promotions that we think fit you the best including your favourite products, hobbies, your birthday and family members (for example, children’s names and birthdays).



The main reason we use this information is to provide you with our products and services (whether available via the website or offline). 

If you have opted-in to receive marketing from us then we will also use this information to send you communications (including extra points promotions if you’re a [Beautycard](http://www.superdrug.com/beautycard/introducing-the-superdrug-beautycard-your-new-shopping-essential/page/beautycard/) member). These will all be sent by Superdrug but may contain offers and information from other companies that we think you may be interested in, including from our sister company The Perfume Shop Limited. Rest assured, we will never share your details with other companies to let them send you their marketing directly. For more information on our marketing activities, see our Privacy Promise at the end of this policy.

We may keep copies of any correspondence you send us including questions, feedback, complaints and any problems you have reported, as well as your registration history with us (including [Beautycard](http://www.superdrug.com/beautycard/introducing-the-superdrug-beautycard-your-new-shopping-essential/page/beautycard/) registration), competition submissions and responses to our online questionnaires. This is to allow us to respond to you if appropriate, and for our internal record keeping and product development.

Finally we may also use your information for market research and analysis purposes, but this will be on an anonymised basis (so no one will know who you are).

## Who do we share this information with?

We may share your information with:

  * Companies performing services on our behalf (such as marketing agents, recruitment agents and service providers such as our website host) who will only use the information to provide that service to us. These organisations may provide services to us from other countries, which may mean that personal information is transferred to those other countries;
  * Other members of our corporate group (the A S Watson group of companies) for market analysis purposes (but only on an anonymised basis);
  * A purchaser or potential purchaser of our business or assets;
  * Organisations which we need to share information with either for legal reasons, to prevent or investigate criminal activity, or to protect our or our customers’ rights (for example the police, the courts, fraud investigation organisations, insurers, solicitors, auditors and financial advisors); and
  * Credit checking organisations. 



## How to get copies of or amend the information we have collected

You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998. We may charge a small fee for this (which will be no more than £10). If you would like a copy of the personal information we hold about you please write to Customer Services, 118 Beddington Lane, Croydon, Surrey, CR0 4TB.

If you need to update any details relating to your [Beautycard](http://www.superdrug.com/beautycard/introducing-the-superdrug-beautycard-your-new-shopping-essential/page/beautycard/) registration then you can either update them online at [superdrug/beautycard](http://www.superdrug.com/beautycard/introducing-the-superdrug-beautycard-your-new-shopping-essential/page/beautycard/), or by calling our Loyalty Helpline on 08445 464747*. If you think any other information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, please call us on 0800 096 1055 as soon as possible so we can correct or update your information. 

## Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect about you.

We may link to other websites which are not within our control (including for example, the website of our sister company The Perfume Shop Limited). Once you have left our website, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement for the website you’re visiting.

## Cookies

We use cookies on our website. Cookies are files that store information on your computer hard drive or browser that mean that we can recognise that you have visited our website before. They make it easier for you to maintain your preferences, and by seeing how you use our website we can try and tailor your experience to fit your preferences. We can also measure how easy our customers find our website to use, so that we can make it as easy as possible for you. 

You can, should you choose, disable the cookies from your browser and delete all cookies currently stored on your computer. On Microsoft Internet Explorer, this can be done by selecting “Tools/Internet Options” and reviewing your privacy settings or selecting “delete cookies”. This may, however, prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

## Phishing

Phishing is the name given to attempts to steal personal details and financial account details from a website user. “Phishers” use fake or “spoof” emails to lead users to counterfeit websites where the user is tricked into entering their personal details, such as credit card numbers, user names and passwords. Please note that Superdrug will never send you emails asking for such details, and our staff will never ask you for your password. 

If you do receive an email like this, or are asked for your password by anyone claiming to work for us, please forward the email or report the incident by calling us on 0800 096 1055 or by writing to us at Customer Services, 118 Beddington Lane, Croydon, Surrey, CR0 4TB

## When you apply for a job with us 

When applying for a job with us through our website you will provide information about yourself, such as your CV. We will use this information to assess your suitability for employment by us and in any subsequent interviewing process. 

We will keep copies of the information you submit and any further correspondence in order to progress your job application and as a record of our employment and fair access processes. If you are a successful candidate then we will keep your information for the purpose of your employment with us. We may also keep information about unsuccessful candidates so that we can contact them in the future about other vacancies we think may be of interest. 

We sometimes employ external recruitment agents to help with the recruitment process. We will always retain control of your information (including CVs you may submit) and the recruitment agent must act in accordance with our instructions when using that information.

## Our Privacy Promise

If you have registered with us (including as a [Beautycard](http://www.superdrug.com/beautycard/introducing-the-superdrug-beautycard-your-new-shopping-essential/page/beautycard/) member) you can receive exclusive offers, bonus points and other promotions. As mentioned before, these will all be sent by Superdrug but may contain offers and information from other companies that we think you may be interested in, including from our sister company The Perfume Shop Limited. 

Rest assured, we won’t send you these, or any other marketing unless you have given us your consent to do so and we will never share your personal details with other companies to let them send you their marketing directly.

## How to Unsubscribe

You can unsubscribe from receiving any marketing from us at any point using one of two methods:

  * changing your communication preferences on your online account on our website
  * via the unsubscribe link that you’ll find at the bottom of every marketing email we send



Please note that if you unsubscribe from us then you won’t receive any further marketing from Superdrug; however if you have separately given your permission to receive marketing from other companies, for example The Perfume Shop Limited, then you will still receive marketing from those companies unless you also unsubscribe from them.

* Calls to our Loyalty Helpline are charged at 5p per minute from landlines (but are likely to cost more from mobile phones)
