# Privacy Policy | Supercuts

The Supercuts mobile application makes use of the Google Maps API, which is covered under the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).

"Personal information" means information that specifically identifies you as an individual, such as your full name, telephone number, e-mail address, postal address, or certain account numbers. This website may include web pages or registration forms that give you the opportunity to provide us with personal information about yourself. You do not have to provide us with personal information if you do not want to; however, that may limit your ability to use certain functions of this website or to request certain services or information.

**Analytics**  
We use third party web analytical services such as Adobe Analytics, to measure activity across our website. Adobe Analytics records information about website visitors across our e-mail and online platforms including IP addresses, browser types, referring pages, pages visited and time spent on a particular site. We receive and use this information to improve and tailor the user experience on our website based on your past and present interactions on our site. If your e-mail address is on our mailing list, we may link analytics information to your e-mail address and follow-up with you by e-mail for example in situations where you might have begun but not completed a process of registering, enrolling for a service or an online check-in.
