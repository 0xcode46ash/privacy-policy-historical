# SuperPages.com: About Us & Help: Privacy Policy

Â  | 

**Straight talk about Internet privacy** Verizon New Media Services, Inc. ("Verizon") respects your right to privacy. When you visit this site you may provide information on two different levels about your visit: 

  * Anonymous statistics collected as you browse the site, and 
  * Personal information you knowingly give us.



**What information does the Web site gather?  
**Please be assured that we do not collect personal information about you from the website unless you provide it to us. This means that you can visit our Web sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself (such as your e-mail address). 

As you browse the site, our web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:

  * How many people visit our site 
  * Which pages people visit on our site 
  * From which domains our visitors come (e.g., aol.com) 
  * Which browsers people use to visit our site



None of this information is associated with you as an individual (see information about cookies below). We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make the Web site easier for you and other visitors to use. 

**What about pages that ask for personal information?  
**When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific purpose, we use the information for that purpose (such as to provide the service or information the visitor has requested). For example, you may be asked to give us individual information to purchase a product or service, receive information, manage online account registration, or apply for a job. The information may range from your zip code, to your phone number, account number, a credit card number, age, gender, mother's maiden name, social security number, e-mail address, organization URL, resume, or mailing address.

When visitors use our Web site to order services, we may use this personally identifiable information as we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published number), or to evaluate your service needs and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. If you do not want us to contact you, you can remove your name from our telephone or mail solicitation lists by clicking on [Contact Us](http://www.superpages.com/about/contact.html). Please note that this removes your name from SuperPages, however, to be removed from other websites in the Verizon family of companies ("Verizon Family"), contact them directly. 

**What happens to information when I fill out registration forms?**   
The registration forms request accurate contact information (like name and e-mail address) and preferences that help us better serve you. Your name and e-mail address are used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. You may change your email, user ID or password online; or you can choose to remove your name from our user list by going to Contact Us and emailing us a request to remove your name. 

To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand the site's capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. We will update this privacy statement as policies change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area. 

**Do you sell or give my information to companies outside of the "Verizon Family?"**   
We do not sell or disclose personally identifiable information obtained online about our visitors, to anyone outside of the "Verizon Family" unless you specifically authorize it, to complete a transaction that you initiated, it is required by law, or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property. If you provide personally identifiable information to us in the context of an event Verizon sponsors with another company, such as a contest, or if you register on a co-sponsored site or feature, you may also be providing the personally identifiable information to the co-sponsor. This will be made clear to you before you submit the information and you can decide whether or not to participate. 

Verizon may share non-personally identifiable information with non-"Verizon Family" companies in order to assess the results of a promotion or event or to enhance your online experience. For example, we may provide statistical information that is not identified with you: 

  * The number of people who visit the website, which pages were visited and for how long, and the referral URL. 
  * When we host co-branded versions of the superpages.com site (or portions of the superpages.com site). Our co-branded sites may also contain clear GIFs (electronic images that allow this site to collect anonymous information about your visit to the site). 
  * Non-personally identifiable information may also be disclosed to non-Verizon-Family companies if it is required by law, or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property. 



**This information does not contain any information that would personally identify you.**

In addition, Verizon may support features and content that appear on other companies' web sites that you may visit. These companies may collect information about you, but Verizon does not have control over the collection practices of these companies. If you are visiting a web site which indicates that it is "powered by superpages.com," please read the privacy policy of that web site for its policies regarding information collection and usage.   
**  
Does this site send e-mail to site visitors?**   
At times, online surveys are conducted in which you can choose to participate. In addition, we may use e-mail to communicate with our customers, to respond to visitors' e-mail, to confirm orders placed online, and to send information that a visitor has requested. Occasionally, we may use opt-in e-mail lists from third parties to promote our latest specials. If you receive an unwanted e-mail from us, you can click Contact Us and simply ask us to remove you from our list.   
**  
Do you accommodate links to other sites?**   
This website contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites. We are committed to safeguarding customer privacy on our website. Verizon may, however, host (or contract with third parties to host) web site advertising linked to the superpages.com site (the "Verizon-Hosted Web Site Ad(s)"). If you provide personally identifiable information while visiting any Verizon-Hosted Web Site Ad, you will also be providing the personally-identifiable information to the advertiser. In addition, Verizon may share non-personally identifiable information collected from any Verizon-Hosted Web Site Ad with non-"Verizon Family" companies in order to complete a transaction that you initiated or to assess and report the results of the ad. Verizon is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by the advertiser.   
**  
What is Verizon's position regarding online advertising and third party ad servers?**  
Verizon accepts advertisements from third parties that serve advertising into the SuperPages site. Verizon may use "clear gifs" provided by such third parties in the pages containing the ad(s) that Verizon sends to your browser. These "clear gifs" provide usage pattern information about the ads to third parties. The data does not contain personally identifiable information. 

As part of the online advertising process, we may use information supplied from third party ad serving companies as well as other third party companies in several ways such as to:

  * gain a better understanding of the type of individuals viewing or visiting different web sites
  * evaluate and prioritize site selection when developing online media plan
  * geographically target advertising 
  * deliver product and pricing advertising/information applicable to the customers' state 
  * gauge the effectiveness of our online advertising 



**Non Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically**   
A cookie is a small, encrypted data string our server writes to your hard drive that contains your unique User ID for our Web site. Cookies help us to identify returning visitor's to our websites, which allows us to give you a more personalized, useful experience on our website. 

Cookies help Verizon to enhance the user's online experience and are used to:

  * deliver the appropriate geographic message 
  * manage frequency of ad exposure; avoid over delivery of the same message
  * tailor an advertisement to better match your interests and preferences 
  * ensure that you see the correct products and pricing applicable to the state in which you live 
  * understand advertising effectiveness 



However, customers are free to delete website cookies. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. To disable cookies, see "Setting Cookie Preferences" at the end of this policy. 

However, you need to understand that some websites/adserving companies have the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you reenter the same site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the adserving company/network, and specifically provide personal data. 

Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent adserving companies from reestablishing history on a visitor. The visitor must either continue to decline cookies each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out. When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie. This new cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future. Opt-out cookies do not contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify your computer uniquely. 

Customers who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their browser advise them each time a web site attempts to send a cookie to your system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie.

Customers who choose to "opt out" after deleting cookies will receive an anonymous/non personally identifiable cookie. 

**Who do I contact if I am concerned about online advertising and privacy?  
** All concerns or questions about your privacy related to online advertising should be addressed through our Customer Care Center which can be reached by clicking on [Contact Us](http://www.superpages.com/about/contact.html). 

**Does Verizon use the information provided online to profile its customers?**   
The combination of offline and online information provided by the customer has the ability to enhance the customer experience, and make the consumer's interaction with Verizon more meaningful and relevant. Verizon requires notification of any consumer profiling or purchasing behavior being captured by Verizon online and combined with offline information be clearly stated to the consumer at the time of online data collection. The consumer will have the ability to choose not to have that information aggregated and be part of subsequent marketing campaigns by so indicating at the point of the application, or by choosing to Opt-Out of future marketing campaigns from Verizon by clicking on [Contact Us](http://www.superpages.com/about/contact.html). 

**Please note:**   
We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or to comply with a legal process served relating to our web site.

What security measures are in place to restrict access to personal data?

** There are a variety of security measures in place that limits internal access to data stored by the Verizon site. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only and requires an employee to have a secure ID and password to access the information. In addition, logs are reviewed regularly to spot any inconsistencies. The site is continually updated with the latest known security patches that are periodically published by the system vendor. Any information that you give is password protected. For your protection, the system automatically locks out a user after 3 incorrect tries and after 20 minutes of idle time per secure session. If you forget your password, you will be prompted to supply your customer ID number and your password will be e-mailed to you.   
**  
What information is stored by the site or in cookies?**   
Registration information, bill and online shopping, data and contact e-mail addresses are stored in Verizon databases which are physically secure environments that are not accessible via the Internet. This information is only available to you through the use of a secure ID and password, and the information is transferred from our databases for your viewing.
