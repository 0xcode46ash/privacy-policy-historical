# About SuperPages® Services

We at GTE are constantly striving to provide excellent service to you, our customers and business partners, while building a long lasting relationship with you. To achieve these goals, we occasionally need information about you when you visit our site.

First and foremost, GTE respects your right to privacy. When you visit SuperPages®, you may be providing information to GTE on two different levels about your visit: 

  * Anonymous statistics collected as you browse the site, and
  * Personal information you knowingly give us.



We want you to be aware of how we handle this information.

**Statistics about your visit**

As you browse the site, GTE's computers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via web server logs and browser cookie files, we monitor statistics such as:

  * How many people visit our site 
  * Which pages people visit on our site
  * From which domains our visitors come (e.g., "gte.net" or "aol.com")
  * Which browsers people use to visit our site



While we gather this information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use. 

**Personal information you knowingly give us**

Within GTE SuperPages® you may be asked to give us personal information, such as when you ask a question that requires a response, or request rate information online. This information may range from your generic zip code, to your specific account number, e-mail address and phone number. 

GTE would like to assure you that we do not: 

  * Collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us.
  * Sell the names and addresses of our customers [site users] to outside vendors.



GTE does:

  * Safeguard customers' information from unauthorized access.
  * Collect, maintain and use customer information as necessary to provide the most helpful and personalized products and services to meet customers' needs.
  * Honor customers' requests to remove their names from our telephone or mail solicitation lists.
  * Maintain confidentiality of personally identifiable customer information when undertaking projects with other companies.



GTE has always valued your privacy, and we reinforce this belief throughout our organization. Your information will be protected as described unless the specific web page says otherwise. If you have further questions about our privacy policy, please [contact us](http://superpages.com/about/contact.html).
