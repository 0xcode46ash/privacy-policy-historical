# Store Policy - Privacy Policy - SuperMediaStore.com

We are committed to protect your privacy online the best we can. We have created our Privacy Policy ("Policy") Statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of our shoppers. Questions regarding this policy should be directed to _customerservice@supermediastore.com_.

**What information does SuperMediaStore.com collect?**

In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, we collect two forms of visitor information: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Some of this information is collected by third parties who may be placing and reading cookies on visitors’ browsers, or may use web beacons or similar technologies to collect information in connection with promotions or programs such as the Google Trusted Stores program. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a customized, smooth, and efficient shopping session.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

This refers to information that does not, by itself, identify you as a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based on where you have shopped for on our web site in several ways. This information is then compiled and analyzed on both an individual and an aggregate basis. Such information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") information as well as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route or reroute information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, which allows web servers to locate and to identify your computer. Computers require an IP addresses in order for users to communicate over the Internet.

**Shopping**

We collect IP addresses for the purpose of system administration, gathering broad demographic information, enabling ads to be served on our web site, reporting Non-Personally Identifiable Information to our advertisers, and for monitoring the level of activity on our site. We collect information from site visitors, such as the URLs they came from, their IP addresses, domain types (e.g., .com or .org), browser types, country, state, possible telephone area code where their servers are located, the pages viewed by customers during their visits, and any search keywords entered on our site.

**Ordering**

When you order from us, we collect personally identifiable information from you. If you order one of our products or any services, we will collect your name, user name, account password, e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, product information, payment information, order number, referring URL, and IP address. We collect such information in order to fill your order, and also in order to get in contact with you regarding your order and/or to send you promotional materials. Before you submit your order, you will have the opportunity to review the order and make any changes in addition to the information that is already entered. Such changes might be automatically kept for future use. **_We do not accept any walk-in orders. Will Call orders are accepted and you must select that option upon check-out in order to receive the information needed to come and pick up your order at our Will Call counter._**

**Security Measurement**

All online transactions at SuperMediaStore.com are processed with 128-bit industry-standard SSL encryption held by the SuperMediaStore.com Store SSL Authorization Certification Encryption Key. When you enter your private information into the order form, it is transmitted across the Internet in a 128-bit highly encrypted (scrambled) form, and then decoded when it gets to SuperMediaStore.com (where your information will be safely and confidentially kept). When viewing your data, your information is also protected by a store password and a store secure key and will be encrypted until it gets to us. For more information about security issues regarding transactions please contact  _customerservice@supermediastore.com_.

**Online Surveys and Polling**

In order to improve our services, we ask some of our customers to voluntarily complete surveys, which may be collected by an independent third party. That surveyor collects Non-Personally Identifiable Information for the sole purpose of providing reports to SuperMediaStore.com about our shoppers' interests and opinions. Answers from individual surveys are kept confidential, although Non-Personally Identifiable Information is collected and will be disclosed to third parties. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, simply refuse such service when asked.

**Contact Information and Third Party Data**

If you contact SuperMediaStore or our customer service representatives by telephone, e-mail or letter, we may keep a record of your correspondence or comments. If you report a problem with our site, we may collect information which specifically relates to you. If you contact us through our feedback area or by calling one of our customer service representatives, we may ask for your name and e-mail address in order to send you a reply. If other users or third parties send us correspondence regarding your activities or purchases on our site, we may keep the information on file.
