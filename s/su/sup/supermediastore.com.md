This refers to information that does not, by itself, identify as a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based on where you shopped at our web site in several ways. This information is then compiled and analyzed on both personally and an aggregatly basis. Such information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") information as well as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route or reroute information based on the IP address of the destination. In another word, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, which allows web servers to locate and to identify your computer. Computer requires a IP address in order for user to communicate over the Internet.
