#### SupportSoft Privacy Policy

[_"What is Support.com (SupportSoft) doing on my computer?"_](https://web.archive.org/map/whatwedo.asp)

SupportSoft respects your privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of your personal information such as your name, e-mail address and address. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. SupportSoft has created this policy to inform you how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings.

### Notice and Choice

We intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit SupportSoft on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. We do log your Internet address to give us an idea of which parts of our Web site you visit and how long you spend there, but we do not link your Internet address of your computer to anything personally identifiable.

There are times when we request that you voluntarily provide information such as your name, e-mail address and address. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you on the Internet. Generally this information is requested when you register for an online service or when you provide information in connection with an online transaction. If you consent to receiving information from us, you will always have the option to "opt out" of receiving additional information.

### Use of Cookies

We use "cookies" to personalize your Web browsing experience. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that if you would rather not store the information for future use.

### Use of data

SupportSoft does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We may choose to do this in the future with trustworthy third parties and amend this policy. SupportSoft may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patters, and related site information to reputable third parties, but this data will not include personally identifiable information. SupportSoft may also release information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with legal or regulatory requirements; (2) enforce or apply terms of the SupportSoft Web site user agreement; or (3) protect the rights, property or safety of SupportSoft or others.

### Accuracy of data

We do our best to maintain the accuracy of personal information you supply to us. In the future we hope to have tools that will allow you to review and update your information in the future.

### Security of data

This site has reasonable security measures in place to protect the unauthorized access loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

### Policy Subject to Change

If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always kept informed of what data we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Please check this page for changes from time to time to make sure you are aware of our latest privacy practices.

### Consent

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by SupportSoft. Because SupportSoft operates globally, we make information we gather available to our worldwide business units. For those of you visiting us from the European Economic Area, please note that the personal data you enter will be transferred outside the European Economic Area for use by SupportSoft and its affiliates for any of the purposes described above. By using our Web site and providing us with your personal data, you consent to this transfer of your personal data.

### Contact SupportSoft

We are committed to protecting your privacy. If you have any comments, questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at [privacy@SupportSoft.](mailto:privacy@SupportSoft) We will address any issue to the best of our abilities. Thank you for your support of these policies and of SupportSoft
