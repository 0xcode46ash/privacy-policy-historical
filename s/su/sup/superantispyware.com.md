Personal Information includes information like your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and non-public information that is associated with the foregoing. Personal Information does not include information that pertains to you, but cannot reasonably be used to identify you. 

We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. Support.com has created this policy to inform you how your Personal Information will be treated if you use our web sites, software or services. In general, you can visit our web sites without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personally identifiable information from you.

Accordingly, we follow the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Principles") with respect to all such data. The Principles can be found at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>. If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy ("Policy") and the Principles, the Principles will govern.

We may combine information that we have about you with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. Support.com automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Support.com cookie information, and pages you request.

During your use of our software and services, our systems may also collect information from your computer that is not used to identify you, but is helpful in our efforts to provide the features or services you have requested. This includes information such as the type of computer and processor you are using, which version of the operating system is installed, the configuration of your computer in terms of other application programs used, your computer’s Media Access Control address, whether any security software is installed and if it is up-to-date, and information on how you use our products.
