**Normal Website Usage**

You can visit Suzuki 's Website to read product information or use our online tools (calculators, configurators, etc.) without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. The only information we collect and store during normal Website usage is the name of your Internet service provider, the browser and type of machine you are using, the Website that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time of those requests.

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**

There are instances where Suzuki requests personally identifiable information to provide the Website visitor a service or correspondence (eg, e-newsletters, promotions, mailed brochures). This information, such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, type of request and possibly additional information, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data by Suzuki and is used to fulfill your request. Suzuki makes every effort to ensure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information using industry-accepted data collection and encryption methodologies such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). 

**Use of Cookies**

Cookies are pieces of information that a Website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes so that we may track site and user activity. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most major Websites. By showing how and when visitors use the site, cookies help Suzuki to better determine which areas of our site are popular and which areas are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of our site - like the Suzuki Direct Finance Online Loan Applications, and the Finance and Buying Power Calculators - will not function properly if you do so. However, we will not be able to recognize you as a visitor over time.
