For example, if you win a sweepstakes or receive compensation from Suzuki, Suzuki is required to include your social security number on government tax forms. Suzuki maintains electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect personal information. In addition, our Suzuki affiliates, Suzuki dealers, Suzuki merchandise licensees, and other sources such as those that provide lists of potential vehicle purchasers or current owners may provide the information they have regarding you or your vehicle to us so that we may serve your needs better.
