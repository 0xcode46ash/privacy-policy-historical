While using such products or services, you are using products or services that are not affiliated with or controlled by Affility Media. Affility Media is not responsible for those people or companies, the content of their products or services, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer. Providing links or otherwise enabling access to third party products or services does not constitute sponsorship of, or affiliation with those people or companies.

## 2.2.3. Cookies, Beacons and Tracking

Affility Media may use "cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tags, locally shared objects, clear GIFs and web beacons. Affility Media treats information collected by cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.

A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that is sent to the Users' computer. Affility Media’s cookies do not include personal data and may be used to: (1) facilitate Users’ login authentication, (2) help Users navigate around the Affility Media’s websites, (3) monitor how many people are using the Service, and (4) store Users preferences and track trends. 

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can disable cookies or set your browser to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use the Service. 

Affility Media may also use Flash cookies (locally shared objects) and HTML5 storage (locally stored objects). Locally shared objects are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember your settings to personalize the look and feel of the Service. Locally shared objects only collect data in the aggregate. 

You may prevent locally shared objects from being placed by disabling locally stored objects in your browser or by visiting www.adobe.com. Locally stored objects, such as HTML5 Web Storage, are used for similar purposes as cookies but typically may contain a greater amount and different types of data than browser cookies.

Affility Media may also use web beacons and pixel tags to count Users who have visited certain pages or viewed certain advertisements. Web beacons, like cookies, do not include personal data. E-mails and other electronic communications Affility Media sends to you may contain pixel tags that enable Affility Media to track your usage of the communication, including whether the communication was opened and/or what links were followed.

## 2.2.4. Server Logs

Affility Media’s servers may log information about your use of the Service, such as: (1) your search activity, pages viewed, the date and time of activity; and (2) any information provided by your computer or mobile device in connection with your use of the Service, such as your browser type, browser language, IP address, mobile carrier, unique device identifier, location, and requested and referring URLs. 

## 3\. Who We Disclose Personal Data To 

## 3.1. Disclosure of Personal Data 

Affility Media does not sell, rent, share or trade personal data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, in providing the Service, Affility Media may disclose personal data to other companies or individuals in the following limited circumstances:

  1. If Affility Media receives your consent; 
  2. If Affility Media has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such personal data is reasonably necessary to: 
    1. satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; 
    2. enforce applicable Terms of Use including investigation of potential violations thereof; 
    3. detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; 
    4. protect against imminent harm to our rights and/or property; or 
  3. As required or authorized by applicable law.



## 3.2. Data Processing 

Affility Media may also disclose personal data to its affiliated companies, contractors or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal data on its behalf. Affility Media requires that these parties agree to process such personal data based on Affility’s Media instructions and in compliance with the Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

## 3.3. Sale of Business

As Affility Media continues to develop and grow, we may buy or sell parts of a business, which could include personal data as one of the transferred business assets. If Affility Media becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, it will provide notice before personal data is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## 4\. Choices for Personal Data

If Affility Media proposes to collect, use or disclose personal data for any purpose other than those described in this Privacy Policy, Affility Media will obtain the Users’ prior consent or offer the Users an effective way to opt out of the use of personal data for those other purposes.

You may choose to withdraw your consent to the use, collection or disclosure of your personal data as outlined in this Policy at any time. If a User withdraws his or her consent, then Affility Media may no longer be able to provide the same level of Service. 

Users are also given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their personal data used for specific purposes such as receiving newsletters or other information from Affility Media. 

Withdrawals of consent will not have an effect on personal or other data that Affility Media has used or disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such withdrawals.

## 5\. Information Security 

Affility Media takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. Affility Media employs physical, electronic and/or procedural safeguards to protect its systems and all personal data under its control against unauthorized access and use. All safety and security measures are appropriate to the sensitivity level of the information collected.

## 6\. Accuracy and Access/Control over Personal Data

Affility Media processes personal data only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy. Affility Media may take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal data processed is accurate, complete and current, but Affility Media is not responsible for verifying the correctness of personal data. 

Affility Media will allow you to access your personal data in the custody or control of Affility Media, and you may request that Affility Media: 

  1. update or correct such personal data; 
  2. change your preferences with respect to communications and other information received from Affility Media; or
  3. delete your personal data on Affility Media’s primary system, by submitting a request to [Customer Support](https://web.archive.org/contact). 



Affility Media will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. Affility Media may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law of for legitimate business purposes. Such updates, corrections, deletions and changes are only effective as of the date they are made and will not effect other information that Affility Media maintains (including archived data and other back-ups), or information that Affility Media has provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy, prior to such update, correction, deletion or change. 

## 7\. Retention of Personal Data

Affility Media stores personal data collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy only as long as is reasonably required to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected or as required or authorized by law.

Affility Media may still retain some of the data to the extent such retention is necessary to resolve disputes, enforce Affility Media’s user agreements, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of the Service.

## 8\. Changes to this Policy

Affility Media reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review it frequently. If Affility Media makes material or significant changes to this Privacy Policy, Affility Media may post the amended Privacy Policy on, or within, the Service or on our Website along with the date it was last modified.
