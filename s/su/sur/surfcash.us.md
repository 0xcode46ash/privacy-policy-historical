For purposes of this policy, Surfcash Traffic Exchange users are divided into three separate categories: Visitors: People who come to our site and look around, but don't join Members: People who sign up for our Traffic Exchange service Referred members: People who sign up 'beneath' an existing member, or who are bought into a downline. These policies are subject to change change. Most likely, we will add new user classes, where the user will be notified in advance that they are 'opting in' to an email list, and be given the choice to 'not opt in', or to subsequently 'opt out'. Information collected on Visitors No personal/private information will be stored about individuals using our search system to find websites. We will be collecting some information about: What browser types are accessing the website How they arrived at this website (i.e.: who/what referred them here) What part of the world they are connecting from (i.e.: Kansas, Texas, Britain, .com, .net, .org) This information will be kept as statistical measure only, so we can learn how to better tailor our services for our users. If the visitor came through a 'referral link', we will attempt to store a cookie on their browser that indicates who referred them. This is to provide credit to the referrer if the visitor joins. Information collected on Members of our free services When a person fills in the Join form, we require, store and record their name and electronic mail address, along with the ip address and reported host name of the terminal making the request. When that person logs in to use our services, we store a temporary electronic 'cookie' on their browser to maintain session information while they are using the service. If they elect 'automatically log me in', we will also store their user name and password in a cookie on their browser. We will not sell, rent, or otherwise distribute any email addresses from our databases*. Information collected on Referred members When a person joins Surfcash Traffic Exchange after having been referred by another member, the originating member is notified in an email of the member of their 'referral'. \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *: "our databases" refers to the email and or physical contact information we have for Surfcash Traffic Exchange members. We will not share this information unless presented with a legal subpoena for governmental inquiry.
