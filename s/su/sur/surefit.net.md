# Sure Fit - Promotions - Privacy Policy

How will Sure Fit notify you of privacy policy changes?

1\. What information do we gather and how do we use it?   
If you order a catalog, or a product from our web site, enter a contest, or promotion, answer a survey, or use other features of our web site, we may request that you provide certain personal information. 

Contact Information -  
The personal information that we collect may include your contact information - your name, postal, and e-mail addresses, and telephone number. We may use your contact information for a variety of purposes, including:  

  * Fulfilling your order and notifying you of its status 
  * Sending you Sure Fit catalogs, notices about new products, and special offers we think you'll find valuable 
  * Administering a contest or promotion that you have entered on our web site 
  * Sending you complimentary gifts for completing a customer survey on our web site 
  * Setting up your personal password protected shopping account on our web site 
  * Notifying you occasionally about important changes to our web site 



Placing an order online will automatically set up your account with SureFit.com if you select a password during the checkout process. You may also choose not to have Sure Fit remember your information. However, having an account with us will make your checkout quicker and easier. 

If you would rather not receive our special e-mail offers and updates, please do not enter your email address on the catalog request page. If you are already receiving our special offers and updates and no longer wish to receive them, please click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any e-mail update that you receive from us and you will be taken off our list. You may call us toll free at 1-888-787-3348 or send an [e-mail](https://web.archive.org/web/20021210082447id_/http%3A//www.surefit.net/customerservice/contact.cfm?) and we will remove you from our lists promptly. We do not rent, sell, or trade e-mail addresses. 

If you wish, you can opt-out of certain kinds of communications while continuing to receive other materials that you desire. So if you want to opt-out of our e-mail promotions while still receiving our catalog through the mail, just let us know. 

You may update your contact information by calling us toll free at 1-888-787-3348 or sending us an [e-mail](https://web.archive.org/web/20021210082447id_/http%3A//www.surefit.net/customerservice/contact.cfm?). If you have a password-protected account with Sure Fit, you may update your contact information online anytime. 

Financial Information -  
If you place an order, we will collect billing information, usually your credit card number and expiration date. If you wish, Sure Fit will store your credit card information for you in a password-protected account, which will allow you to checkout more easily next time you order from us. We never share your credit card number or use it for any purpose besides fulfilling your order. To read more about our security policy, click here. 

Other Personal Information -  
If you answer a survey on our site, we may ask for personal information besides your contact information, such as your preferences or interests. We analyze this information in aggregate form, looking for market trends among our customers, rather than analyzing information about any individual customer. 

Web Site Use Data -   
We collect and aggregate data about how people use our web site so that we can provide a better experience for our visitors. When you visit us, our web server recognizes your domain name but not your e-mail address. We do not tie the data we gather about web site usage to any particular individual - the data is used in aggregate form only. 

**Will Sure Fit disclose the information you provide to outside parties?**  


We do not sell, rent, or trade e-mail addresses. 

If you receive our printed catalog, Sure Fit may occasionally share your mailing address with carefully selected partners. If you do not wish to receive our printed catalog, or if you do not want Sure Fit to share your postal information with our partners, please contact us and we will put you on our do not share list. Call us toll free at 1-888-787-3348 or [e-mail us](https://web.archive.org/web/20021210082447id_/http%3A//www.surefit.net/customerservice/contact.cfm?). 

Sure Fit may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, web site traffic patterns, and similar information to our consultants and reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will not include any personally identifying information. 

In the unlikely event that Sure Fit is sold, or substantially all of its assets acquired, customer information may be one of the transferred assets. 

**How does Sure Fit protect customer information?**  


At Sure Fit, protecting your information is a priority. We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving customer payment data. We also have security measures in place to protect customer data on our servers against unauthorized access. To read more about our security policy, click here. 

**What about cookies?**  


Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies allow our web site to remember you and your preferences when you return to our site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that and disable the cookie. 

Our cookies allow us to recognize you as a returning visitor and to retrieve items in your shopping cart and on your wish list from prior visits. We also use cookies to analyze traffic to our site and track the pages visitors view so that we can improve the content and layout of our website. The information we collect through cookies is used in aggregated form only. 

**How will Sure Fit notify you of privacy policy changes?**  


If our privacy policy changes, we will update this statement accordingly and provide you with the ability to opt-out of any new uses of your personal information. We encourage you to review this page periodically for the latest information on privacy practices at SureFit.com. Last updated May 2002. 

Links to Other Sites -  
We provide links to other sites that we think you'll enjoy. These sites operate independently of Sure Fit and have established their own privacy and security policies. We encourage you to review these policies at any site you visit. 

Children's Privacy -  


Sure Fit does not knowingly solicit or collect information from anyone under the age of thirteen. Sure Fit requires children over the age of 13 to consult with their parents before furnishing any data to us. 

Privacy Promise -  
If you feel that this site is not following its stated privacy policy, you may call us toll free at 1-888-787-3348, or [e-mail us](https://web.archive.org/web/20021210082447id_/http%3A//www.surefit.net/customerservice/contact.cfm?), or write to us at Sure Fit, Inc. / Slipcovers By Mail, Customer Service, 7339 Industrial Boulevard, Allentown, PA 18106.
