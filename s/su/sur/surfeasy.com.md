## Privacy Policy

Last Updated April 18, 2016.

SurfEasy believes in privacy and online freedom and that it should be very clear how we manage and protect your personal information. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us.

We might need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our business or operations.

## The SurfEasy Private Network

The core of our service is the SurfEasy Private Network which provides private and secure data transmission. If you are using the SurfEasy Private Browser, we route your browser Internet traffic through our network. If you are using the SurfEasy Virtual Private Network (VPN) Service, we route all of your Internet traffic through our network. In each case, our software browser or client establishes and maintains an encrypted tunnel between your browser or device and our network.

The SurfEasy network is a No Log network. SurfEasy does not store users originating IP address when connected to our service and therefore cannot identify users when provided IP addresses of our servers. Additionally, SurfEasy cannot disclose information about the applications, services or websites our users consume while connected to our services; as SurfEasy does not store this information.

SurfEasy may need to collect the following operational data in order to operate our Services.

Aggregate bandwidth usage for billing, network operations and support. Temporary usage data to assist with debugging a problem with the service. This information is not retained once trouble shooting is resolved. We perform automated rules-based traffic management for the purposes of maintaining and improving our service. Applying these rules may require real-time analysis of Internet and data traffic including destination websites or IP addresses, originating IP addresses. However, no log is maintained regarding this information as it is a real-time process. The SurfEasy website uses cookies, tracking pixels and related technologies. Cookies are small data files that are served by our platform and stored on your device. Our site uses cookies dropped by us or third parties for a variety of purposes including to operate and personalize the website.

The SurfEasy clients may use in-app analytics technologies, like Google Analytics, to help improve and simplify the overall app, design and service. For the VPN in Opera Browser for Desktop, we create a subscriber ID (generated in sequential order across all subscribers) that allows us to manage that user on our system. If that user clears their browser cache/history, theyâ€™re assigned a new generated subscriber ID. SurfEasy is required to comply with law enforcement where subpoenas, warrants or other legal documents have been provided. We may collect and disclose personal information, including your usage data, to governmental authorities or agencies, including law enforcement agencies, at their request or pursuant to a court order, subpoena or other legal process, if there is a good faith belief that such collection or disclosure is required by law.
