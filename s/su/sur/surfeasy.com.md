# Privacy Policy | SurfEasy

## Privacy Policy

SurfEasy believes in privacy and online freedom and that it should be very clear how we manage and protect your personal information.  This Privacy Policy details how we collect and use your personal information and our commitment protecting it.

## Buying From SurfEasy.com

At SurfEasy.com you can purchase a SurfEasy USB key and access to our proxy network service.  To process purchases we need to collect personal information for billing, shipping and service configuration.  Here’s how we collect and treat that information.

  * SurfEasy uses a third party shopping cart, recurring payment management solution and merchant payment processor to complete your purchase.   For purchasing the product we use Shopify as a shopping cart, Recurly as our recurring payment management solution and BeanStream as our credit card processor.
    * See Shopify’s privacy statement here: <http://checkout.shopify.com/legal/privacy.html>
    * Find Recurly’s privacy policy here: <http://recurly.com/legal/privacy>
    * See BeanStream’s privacy policy here: <http://www.beanstream.com/public/privacy.asp>
  * When your order for a SurfEasy key is placed we send the name, address and phone number to our shipping provider Shipwire for fulfilment
    * You can find their privacy policy here: <http://www.shipwire.com/help/privacy/>
  * SurfEasy does not store your credit card information.
  * SurfEasy receives and stores certain information about who has purchased our products and services.  This information is provided by the third party providers listed above and includes your name, address, payment status, email address, phone number and other personal information you provide during the checkout.   The purchase of your SurfEasy key or service from our website does not associate your personal information with your SurfEasy usage.



Does SurfEasy.com use Cookies?  
Like most companies, we use cookies to improve the quality of our website experience.  A cookie is a small data file that a website or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive when you visit the site.  A cookie cannot read information off your computer’s hard drive.   You can also set your web browser not to enable cookies.  We do not link the information stored from cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit on our website.

## Buying From an Authorized Distributor

You may purchase our products and services from authorized distributors.  If you do so, the privacy policy of the distributor will apply to the personal information they collect from you.  Our distributors will provide us with the information we require to enable your subscription and provide you with ongoing support.  This information includes your name, address, payment status, email address, and phone number.

## Using the SurfEasy Service

In order to create an encrypted connection all of your browsing traffic runs through a SurfEasy managed proxy network.  SurfEasy takes your privacy very seriously and as such has prepared the following privacy policy detailing how we treat your browsing data.

  * SurfEasy’s browser and client establish and maintain an encrypted tunnel between your SurfEasy browser and our proxy network.  Web browsing from your SurfEasy browser uses this tunnel.
  * SurfEasy does not store information that links you to websites, IP addresses or downloads while using the SurfEasy service, except in the following cases:
    1. For troubleshooting purposes – from time to time it may become necessary to temporarily maintain usage data to assist in debugging the system or address a problem with the service. This usage data may include such information as, including but not limited to, the date and time of your login and the IP addresses you visited. This personal information is not retained once the troubleshooting is resolved.
    2. To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.  SurfEasy may maintain usage for an individual user or account if there is a good faith belief that the response is required by law.  See our Privacy Policy  for further information on the extent to which we may disclose your personal information in connection with legal requests and otherwise to prevent harm.
  * SurfEasy may disclose personal information to governmental authorities or agencies, including law enforcement agencies, at their request or pursuant to a court order, subpoena or other legal process, if there is a good faith belief that the response is required by law. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of Canada where SurfEasy has a good faith belief that the response is required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, that the law in question applies to users from that jurisdiction, and where the laws are consistent with generally accepted international standards on human rights.  We may also share personal information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect SurfEasy and its customers from people violating our service Terms of Use. This may include sharing personal information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.
  * SurfEasy maintains a record of the total bandwidth use for an individual account for the purposes of services billing.  This information only maintains the total bandwidth used and does not contain any information identifying the individual websites or IP addresses visited or the originating IP address.
  * SurfEasy performs automated rules based traffic management for the purposes of reducing network latency, improving overall customer experience, improving security, managing network capacity and for other service related reasons.   Applying these rules may require real-time analysis of browser session information including the destination website or IP address, originating IP address and applying rules associated with how the SurfEasy proxy network completes the connection to that site.
  * SurfEasy respects the encrypted connections of websites and IP addresses accessed through our service.  SurfEasy does not in any way perform any sort of “man in the middle” style interception, monitoring or other form of traffic analysis of encrypted connections such as HTTPS.



## Affiliates, Subsidiaries & 3rd Party Service Providers

SurfEasy may use affiliates, subsidiaries and third parties for the purpose of providing its protected browsing service.  Service providers involved in providing SurfEasy protected browsing services are never associated with third parties providing billing services and do not have access to customer identifying information provided for purchase of SurfEasy products or service.  Service providers are located in Canada and outside Canada, and as a result, your browsing information may be processed or transferred globally.  We take all reasonable measures and precautions to protect your personal information when it is being handled by our service providers.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy.

SurfEasy is dedicated to continually improving its service by adding new functionality, products, services and programs. Because of those improvements – along with changes in the law, technology and within SurfEasy’s business – SurfEasy reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy we will post those changes to our website.  If there is a material change to how we use your personally identifiable information, we will notify you by email and our website.

## Business Transactions

We may use and disclose your personal information in connection with the proposed or actual financing, sale or other business transaction involving part or all of our business or assets.  Such use and disclosure would be for the purpose of allowing third parties to determine whether to proceed with the proposed transaction, and if the transaction proceeds, for the purpose of completing the transaction.  Assignees or successors to our business or assets may use and disclose your personal information for the purposes described in this policy.  If SurfEasy becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy proceedings or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, SurfEasy will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
