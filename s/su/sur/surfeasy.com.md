Privacy Policy

Last updated May 2, 2013.

SurfEasy believes in privacy and online freedom and that it should be very clear how we manage and protect your personal information. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us.

We might need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our business or operations. If we make important changes we will notify you by email.

The SurfEasy Private Network

The core of our service is the SurfEasy Private Network which provides private and secure data transmission. If you are using the SurfEasy Private Browser, we route your browser Internet traffic through our network. If you are using the SurfEasy Virtual Private Network (VPN) Service, we route all of your Internet traffic through our network. In each case, our software browser or client establishes and maintains an encrypted tunnel between your browser or device and our network.

_**The SurfEasy network is a no-log network.**_  That means, except for the limited exceptions below, we do not collect any information transmitted through our network. More specifically, we do not collect any information regarding the websites you visit or the IP addresses assigned to you when you access the SurfEasy Private Network, and with respect to our VPN service, we do not collect any data stored on or transmitted from your device, including any data that applications on your device may transmit through our network.

There are a few exceptions where we may need to collect or monitor traffic through our network:

  * We will record your aggregate bandwidth usage for billing and network operations and support;
  * It may become necessary to temporarily maintain usage data to assist in debugging a problem with the service. This usage data may include such information as the date and time of your login and the IP addresses you visited. This personal information is not retained once the troubleshooting is resolved;
  * We may collect and disclose personal information, including your usage data, to governmental authorities or agencies, including law enforcement agencies, at their request or pursuant to a court order, subpoena or other legal process, if there is a good faith belief that such collection or disclosure is required by law;
  * We perform automated rules-based traffic management for the purposes of maintaining and improving our service. Applying these rules may require real-time analysis of Internet and data traffic including destination websites or IP addresses, originating IP addresses. However, no log is maintained regarding this information as it is a real-time process.



Since we manage a global network, your Internet traffic may be routed through one or more different countries.
