Our IADB registration number is 2004040200025. For more information see <http://www.isipp.com/iadb.php>. The Surfnetkids newsletter subscriber lists are never rented or sold, and are used only to receive requested information directly from "Surfing the Net with Kids." Surfnetkids.com may rent its postal mailing list (but never e-mail addresses) to organizations that wish to offer products and services to its subscribers. 

In compliance with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998), newsletter subscribers under thirteen years old are asked to supply a parent's email address. Parents are notified via email of their child's subscription and parents may [cancel their child's subscription](https://web.archive.org/emailedition.htm) at any time. 

Opt-in customized mailing lists are managed by industry leader PostMasterDirect.com, who pledges that your data (email address and other demographic data such as zip code and year born) will never be revealed to the marketers who rent the Surfnetkids opt-in lists. Opt-in customized mailing lists are ONLY for those thirteen and older. To learn more about how PostMasterDirect.com (and their parent company Net Creations) assures your privacy, read [Net Creation's Privacy Policy](http://w3.netcreations.com/privacy.html).
