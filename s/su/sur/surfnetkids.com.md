# Surfing the Net with Kids: Privacy Policy

"Surfing the Net with Kids" respects your privacy and does not distribute, sell or publish any private information. The Surfnetkids newsletter subscriber lists (both the semi-weekly Surfnetkids newsletter and the occasional Surfnetkids Affiliate newsletter) are never rented or sold, and are used only to receive requested information directly from "Surfing the Net with Kids." 

In compliance with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998), newsletter subscribers under thirteen years old are asked to supply a parent's email address. Parents are notified via email of their child's subscription and parents may [cancel their child's subscription](https://web.archive.org/emailedition.htm) at any time. 

Opt-in customized mailing lists are managed by industry leader PostMasterDirect.com, who pledges that your data (email address and other demographic data such as zip code and year born) will never be revealed to the marketers who rent the Surfnetkids opt-in lists. Opt-in customized mailing lists are ONLY for those thirteen and older. To learn more about how PostMasterDirect.com (and their parent company Net Creations) assures your privacy, read [Net Creation's Privacy Policy](http://w3.netcreations.com/privacy.html).

With cookies turned off, you will get the pop-up offer EVERYTIME you visit the site.
