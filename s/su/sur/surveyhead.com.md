Last updated: 02/21/13

Surveyhead is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Surveyhead is a branded site owned and operated by United Sample, Inc., headquartered at 16501 Ventura Blvd., Suite 250, Encino, California, 91436, with its United Kingdom office located at 344-354 Gray’s Inn Road, London, WC1X 8BP. 

Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our website and services. By using this website and registering to our service you agree that your personal information will be shared with United Sample, Inc. in the United States where a lower level of privacy protection may apply than in your own country.

What personally identifiable information does Surveyhead collect from me?

Surveyhead collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of websites.

Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, Surveyhead asks for your name, email address, zip code, household information and personal interests. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register, you are no longer anonymous to Surveyhead and you can access the various protected areas of the site.

For a more detailed discussion about the collection of data through cookies, please see the section immediately below.

What are cookies and how does Surveyhead use them?

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Surveyhead may use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. Some areas on Surveyhead where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable may require that you accept cookies. This avoids you having to enter your login information many times in one day.

Currently, cookies are utilized by Surveyhead within the following four primary categories 1) business cookies which operate as a quality control and verification mechanism in connection with the survey process; (2) performance cookies so that traffic patterns and users on the Surveyhead website may be measured and optimized; (3) user cookies so that user information may be recorded so as to enhance performance and user experience on the website; and 4) targeting cookies which are utilized to measure web viewing for market research purposes.

If you do not wish to have your activity and browsing behaviors tracked by Surveyhead, you may opt out by contacting our customer support team at support@surveyhelpcenter.com or selecting the opt-out button located on the “My Account” page. 

In addition, from time to time, tracking mechanisms such as cookies or web beacons may be used by third party content and advertisings which you may choose to view while being on the Surveyhead site. You should review the privacy policies of the websites serving this content, as they may allow for the gathering of information to serve advertising on multiple third party websites over which Surveyhead has no control. Please consult the privacy policies of such third party websites for more information.

You can also try to change the browser settings on your computer or your mobile devices which can allow you to “disable cookies.” If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those Surveyhead services that require registration in order to participate.

Who is collecting information and for what purpose?

Surveyhead collects valuable information, which assists in developing new products and services. When you are on a Surveyhead site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Surveyhead or with any other third party with whom you elect to share such information, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than Surveyhead, the use of your data and personal information will be governed by appropriate confidentiality and security agreements between Surveyhead and such third parties. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service or by electing not to participate in any given survey. 

Promotions that run on Surveyhead may be sponsored by companies other than Surveyhead or may be co-sponsored by Surveyhead and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you do not want your data to be shared.

Any Sensitive Information (i.e. personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual) will be treated with additional care. If Surveyhead intends to disclose such information to a third party or use it for a different purpose than originally collected, then you will be expressly asked permission prior to any such disclosure or use.
