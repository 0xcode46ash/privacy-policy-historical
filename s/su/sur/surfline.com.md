# Surfline Privacy Policy and Promise | SURFLINE.COM

* * *

**OUR PROMISE**

Surfline ("Surfline"), a service provided by Surfline\Wavetrak, Inc. ("Surfline", "we", "our", or "us"), respects your privacy and promises to earn and keep your trust. 

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect from all sources, including in connection with our websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), widgets, and electronic newsletters or communications (collectively the "Services") that link to this Privacy Policy. 

Questions regarding this policy and our practice should be directed to Surfline Support, by e-mail to [Support@Surfline.com](mailto:Support@FishTrack.com), or by postal mail to Surfline, 300 Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 310, Huntington Beach, CA 92648.

**Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our [Terms of Use](http://www.surfline.com/terms_conditions.cfm). It tells you what information we collect, how we protect it and what choices you have about how that information is used. Most information collected is to enable us to best meet your needs as an action sports participant in a highly customized and responsive manner.

**Children's Privacy**

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Surfline does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If Surfline learns that personal information of persons under 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Services, Surfline will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Surfline Registered user or Subscriber, then please contact Surfline at support@Surfline.com to have that child's account terminated and personal information deleted.

**Public Forum Discussions and Comments**

Please note that any information that you reveal in a public forum (such as a bulletin board or comments) will be seen by third parties not related to Surfline and is therefore not subject to this privacy policy.

**SECTION 1 - PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We collect information in five distinct areas:

  1. Alerts / Newsletter subscriptions: name, e-mail address
  2. Subscription enrollment and Profile creation: email, name, zip/postal code, and password.  All Personal information is protected by your password.
  3. Interaction with the web site and solution tools: personal usage information. Surfline presents interactive tools to assist you in making surfing decisions, in doing so; Surfline collects personal usage information for the sole purpose in helping you make the best decisions.
  4. Cookies: personal usage information. Please see the "Cookies and Web Beacons" section below for more information.
  5. Location: We may collect and store information about your location if you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. You may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with such information. Location data is not shared with third party sites, advertisers, or sponsors.



Surfline does not store any credit card information. Surfline uses a secure hosted service which stores personal credit card data, and manages credit card processing for subscriptions and transactions.

**SECTION 2 - USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Personal information will not be released to third parties without your explicit permission. Surfline may provide your information to third parties in aggregate with others' information, which does not allow you to be identified or contacted ("Aggregate Information"). For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of our site and the activities they conduct while on our site. We might also inform a pharmaceutical company (that may or may not be an advertiser on our site) that "30 percent of our users live east of the Mississippi" or that "25 percent of our users have looked into surfing charts in Orange County." Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge for this information.

**SECTION 3 - SECURITY**

We use encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of Personal information that you share with us. However, no data transmission over the Internet (or, with respect to our mobile services, over cellular phone networks) can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect Personal information, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from the Service, and you do so at your own risk.

We restrict access to Personal information to Surfline employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. 

**SECTION 4 - YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES**

If you would like to opt out from our sharing of your personal Information with unaffiliated third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes you may contact support at support@Surfline.com and request that we opt you out of such sharing. We may ask you to provide additional information for identity verification purposes, or to verify that you are in possession of an applicable email account.

If you have signed up to receive our e-mails and prefer not to receive marketing information from this Service, follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided on any marketing e-mail you receive from this Service. 

**California Residents \-- Your California Privacy Rights**

California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place.

As discussed above in Your Privacy Choices, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your personal Information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes or to find out more about your opt-out rights, please contact Surfline support as described above.

**SECTION 6 - COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD-PARTY SITES, AD SERVERS, SPONSORS**

Some of our Services contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

Surfline Services covered by this privacy statement sometimes may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. The site will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.

We also use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting and web analytics, as well as to assist with delivery of relevant content, marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third party service providers, advertisers and/or partners may also place web beacons for these third parties. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement. For more information on how our sites may use third-party ad servers and your ability to opt-out of targeted advertising from such third party ad servers, please see the section below on "Third Party Ad Servers".

**DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURE**

Some browsers or other tools include "Do Not Track" (DNT) features which, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. The Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups and regulators to develop a DNT browser technology standard to provide a common understanding as to how to interpret the DNT signals, but to date no standard has been adopted. Since there is no standard at this time, Surfline does not currently respond to DNT signals. 

**CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

Surfline may change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting revisions to our site. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. In the event that any changes are made to use of your Personal information, you will be informed via e-mail, and will afford you the opportunity to opt-out of any further use. Your use of the site constitutes acceptance of the provisions of this Privacy Policy and your continued usage after such changes are posted constitutes acceptance of each revised Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy or any revised policy, please exit the site immediately.
