# Privacy Policy

At SurveyMethods, perhaps the only thing we value more than your business is your personal privacy, which remains our top priority. We do not access your surveys or respondent data.

## General Security Policy

SurveyMethods respects your privacy concerns. We work to collect only as much information as needed to make your experience as secure, efficient, and successful as possible.

## Collecting Information

SurveyMethods will not use information from your surveys in any way. Any additional material you provide (such as text, images, email addresses, etc.) in your use of SurveyMethods are accessible only to the account holder. Also, we do not collect personally identifiable information about you except when you voluntarily provide it.

## Using Information

SurveyMethods may statistically analyze user behavior and characteristics to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the web site. We may also collect IP addresses for system administration, recordkeeping, and to help us find sites referring the most potential users to SurveyMethods. Your IP address, which is automatically assigned to your computer on the web, is recorded as it contacts our servers. While we reserve the right to showcase your organization’s name on our customer list (unless agreed upon otherwise by both parties herein), we do not share personal information.

## Cookies

Cookies are digital files that allow web sites to recognize returning users. While most browsers allow users to refuse cookies or request permission on a case-by-case basis, our site will not function properly without them. SurveyMethods.com uses cookies primarily to enable the functioning of surveys accessed on SurveyMethods.com.

## Opting Out

SurveyMethods.com allows individuals who are contacted by our sales team to opt out of sales and marketing communication from us at any time. However, registered account holders are required to receive communication limited to system feature notifications and periodic system update notifications.

©2006 SurveyMethods. Policies herein are effective April 15, 2006. SurveyMethods.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
