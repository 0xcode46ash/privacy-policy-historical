Privacy and Security Statement

**PERSONAL INFORMATION**   
We will never sell any personally identifiable information to a third party for marketing purposes without your consent.

We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of our customer information. However, we are required to disclose certain information to governmental taxing authorities in order to ensure that you will be credited for tax withholding deposits made on your behalf. 

We will permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to have access to that information. 

We will attempt to keep customer files complete, up-to-date, and accurate. We will tell our customers how and where to conveniently access their information (except when weâ€™re prohibited by law) and how to notify us about errors which we will promptly correct. 

**SECURITY**  
SurePayroll protects your data with state-of-the-art equipment and procedures. 

Anytime you are logged into the SurePayroll Web site, you will be in a "secure session" that is established with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and verified by VeriSign's Global Site Certificate technology. While connected with SSL, every transmission between your computer and SurePayroll is encrypted with 128 bit (strong) encryption, completely hiding your data while it travels to us. 

We even have employed an automatic time-out feature. If your session is inactive for more than 10 minutes, you are automatically logged out, preventing unauthorized access. Your payroll data is stored in our data center which has Kevlar-lined walls, bullet-proof glass and 24-hour security guards. 

We have taken every reasonable measure we know of to ensure that your data remains private.If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail us at [info@surepayroll.com](mailto:info@surepayroll.com) or call us toll free at 1-877-954-SURE (7873).
