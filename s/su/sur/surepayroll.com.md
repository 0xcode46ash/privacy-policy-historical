SurePayroll, Inc.'s privacy policy explains how we collect and utilize information we obtain at the SurePayroll.com website (the "Site"). Our privacy policy applies to information collected at the Site unless you and we have entered into a written (including electronic) agreement that provides other terms. It does not apply to information that we may collect by other means.

**We do not sell any personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes without your consent.**

We maintain security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of confidential customer information under our control. In connection with performing services, we are required to disclose certain information to governmental taxing authorities in order to ensure that credit is made for tax withholding deposits. We also use customer information to perform the services you contract with us to provide and to communicate with you. In extraordinary circumstances, we may also be required for other reasons to disclose confidential information of customers to law enforcement or government officials.

We will permit only authorized personnel, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to have access to personally identifiable customer information.

We will attempt to keep customer files complete, up-to-date, and accurate. We will tell our customers how and where to conveniently access their information (except when we're prohibited by law) and how to notify us about errors, which we will endeavor to promptly correct.

**Collection of Non-Personal Information**

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, SBC). We use such information in connection with our business operations and in administering the Site.

**How we use Non-personal Information**

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services. 

Use of Aggregate Information: From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the users of the Site and our services. We collect this information to determine information regarding the use of our site and general information about our customers. We may also group this information into aggregate date in order to describe the use of our Site and to provide general aggregated information, such as the SurePayroll Small Business Scorecard. The aggregated data will not personally identify any customers or visitors to the Site.

   **Use of Cookies**

SurePayroll protects your data with state-of-the-art equipment and procedures. Anytime you are logged into the SurePayroll Web site, you will be in a "secure session" that is established with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and verified by VeriSign's Global Site Certificate technology. While connected with SSL, every transmission between your computer and SurePayroll is encrypted with 128 bit (strong) encryption, completely hiding your data while it travels to us.

We even have employed an automatic time-out feature. If your session is inactive for more than 10 minutes, you are automatically logged out, preventing unauthorized access. Your payroll data is stored in our data center which has Kevlar-lined walls, bullet-proof glass and 24-hour security guards.

We have taken every reasonable measure we know of to ensure that your data remains private.
