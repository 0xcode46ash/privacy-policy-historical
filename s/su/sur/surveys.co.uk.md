**USE OF YOUR INFORMATION**  
Surveys.co.uk is keen to ensure that the principals of our opt-in when your data is collected are clearly explained:

Some questions on our consumer surveys are specific to our named sponsors, and by expressing a positive interest in their brand or products you are also agreeing to contact from them. By volunteering your phone number you are agreeing to telephone contact by these named sponsors. You may subsequently need to contact these named sponsor brands directly if in the future you decide to opt-out of further communication from these brands.   
Your data may be used for analytical purposes. Your data may also be used in conjunction with data we may have received from other sources in order to personalize and target communication to you better, and we may share information with other companies for the same reason.   
Your data may be shared and combined with other companies who hold your personal data, and we may use information from other sources to add to data we already hold. This information may help us to improve our ability to service your needs on a personalized basis, by helping us to learn more about you and you purchasing habits and allowing us to let you know about offers you might be interested in.
