# SurferNETWORK: Privacy Policy

Personal Information   
We do not disclose individual information to any other party unless we are required to do so by law. The minimum information required to register is your gender, age, and zip code. Providing your e-mail address, although optional, would allow us to communicate directly with you when responding to any questions you may have. 

Cookies   
A “cookie” is a small amount of data that can be sent to your browser and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are often used to track Internet usage. To avoid the necessity of re-registering each time you use your Player and to maintain your personalized features, we assign you a random number when you initially register, which may be placed in a cookie. This technique allows SurferNETWORK to count and keep track of unique listeners using our service to fulfill our counting obligations to broadcasters and advertisers, without ever revealing your identity. Advertisers broadcasting via SurferNETWORK may use their own cookies for similar purposes, but we do not provide them access to your personal information. 

SurferNETWORK Technology   
Much effort has gone into research and development to provide you the best listening experience on the Internet. Our proprietary software is patent-pending. Our player contains browser capabilities used to display useful information and to take you to popular sites and those consistent with the personalization process. These popular and personalized sites can easily be visited while you are listening to your favorite radio station. You should be aware that other companies' privacy and security policies might differ from ours. 

Security   
We use physical, electronic and managerial safeguards to insure the security of personal data provided to us. Our security measures guard against unauthorized access, disclosure, use, change and destruction of data.
