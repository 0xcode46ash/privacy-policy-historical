##### 1\. Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes how Micro Focus International plc and its group companies including Attachmate®, Borland®, NetIQ®, Novell® and SUSE (" **Micro Focus** ") use your personal information. Your right to privacy is very important to Micro Focus®. At Micro Focus, we believe that the personal information you provide to us must be kept confidential and used in a responsible fashion. We consistently strive to put our best efforts towards achieving both of these objectives.

**What do we do with the information we collect?**

We use this information for a variety of reasons. The main reason we use this information is to provide you with the website and our products and services (whether available via the website or offline). We also use the information for:

  * internal record keeping;
  * product and service development;
  * developing our website;
  * answering your queries or complaints;
  * delivery of products or services and/or order fulfillment including through our resellers, distributors and other agents;
  * market research; and
  * marketing our own products and services (including special offers and upgrades) to you.



**Marketing**

We may send you information about Micro Focus’ products and services or related data by post or email or telephone, unless you have asked us not to do so.

If you are a customer of ours or you have previously asked us for information on our products and services, such as subscribing to our email news service, then we may send you information by email. However, in every marketing email message we send you we will give you the opportunity to unsubscribe from our mailings altogether.

We do not provide your personal information to external organizations (i.e. outside of Micro Focus) for their own marketing purposes without your explicit consent.

If at any time you do not want your information used for direct marketing purposes please contact us at [compliance@microfocus.com](mailto:compliance@microfocus.com) and if you decide that you no longer wish to receive marketing emails from us, please follow the unsubscribe link in one of our marketing email messages.

However, please note that we may send out periodic emails, including to inform you of a technical service or security issues relating to a product or service you have requested or purchased, or confirming your request or purchase of a product or service. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe from these communications, as they are considered an essential part of the service you have chosen.

You can also easily manage and update your membership information at any time by logging onto your Micro Focus profile on our website, including controlling whether you wish to receive marketing emails from us.

**Who do we share this information with?**

Your personal information may be shared across the Micro Focus Group of companies. For example, your personal information may be processed by the relevant Micro Focus group company situated in the country in which you are accessing our website from and the country in which you are purchasing our products/services, if different. Please bear in mind that the countries to which your personal information is sent/accessed from may have a different standard of data protection than the country in which you are situated. However, we have put in place protections to ensure that your information is safeguarded. To find out more information about the companies within the Micro Focus Group that may handle your personal information please visit www.microfocus.com.

We may share your personal information with organizations acting on our behalf and with our manufacturers, agents, distributors or resellers, but they will only use the information to provide our products or services. However, any third party that we may share your information with must act in accordance with our instructions. We may also share your personal information with a purchaser or potential purchaser of our business.

In some circumstances, we may have to disclose your personal information to comply with the law/other regulatory purposes, or because we are required to do so by a court, the police, or other regulatory body.
