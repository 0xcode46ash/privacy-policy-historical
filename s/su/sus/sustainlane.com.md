**1. ** **Introduction**

While you may use some of the functionality of the Site without registration, some of the specific tools and services might require registration. If you do not register with or use the tools, features or services offered on or through the Site, the only information we collect will be "Non-Personal Information" (i.e., Information that is not traceable back to you and cannot be used to identify you. Non-Personal Information includes information such as the web pages that you have viewed.) through the use of Cookies (i.e., Small data files that are stored on the hard drive of a computer used to view web sites that are accessible only by the party or site that placed the Cookie on the hard drive.). If registration is required and you choose to register through the Site, we will require you to submit "Personally Identifiable Information" (i.e., Information that can be traced back to you. Personally Identifiable Information includes information such as your name, home address, telephone number and email address). You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to SustainableCircles. Inaccurate information will affect the information you receive when using the Site and tools and our ability to contact you.
