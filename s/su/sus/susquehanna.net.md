**Who Receives Information and Why**   
There are certain situations where we may share non-public personal information about you with businesses outside of our corporate family as permitted by law. We will not, however, share any information with companies outside of the financial services industry for purposes of marketing that company's products and services. We may share information within our corporate family. The following is a description of the types of businesses within our corporate family with which we may share information: 

  * a registered investment advisor, a mortgage company, a securities broker-dealer, a trust company, insurance agencies, and an automobile leasing company.

**Service Providers/Joint Marketing Partners**   
In order to provide you with valuable financial products or services, we may share with businesses outside of our corporate family both Transactional Information and Credit Report Information. These businesses will be performing marketing and other services on our behalf. We also may share this information with other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements. 

**Information Sharing Within Our Corporate Family**   
We may share with the businesses within our corporate family Transactional Information for any reason. However, you can tell us not to share your Credit Report Information, within our corporate family, by simply following the instructions on the attached Opt-Out Selection Form.

**Please Note the Following:**

  * If you send us a completed Opt-Out Selection Form, we may still share, within our corporate family, Transactional Information for any reason.

**Former Customers**   
All of the practices described in this notice apply to former customers as well.

**How We Protect Your Information**   
We have strict policies and procedures to safeguard your privacy. Some of these measures involve technology that is required to maintain data security.

We review and update our practices as needed to maintain security.
