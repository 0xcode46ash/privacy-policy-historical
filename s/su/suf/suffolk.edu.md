This Internet Privacy Policy will tell you what information we collect, how it is used and what your choices are.  Please read this Internet Privacy Policy carefully.

### Use of Cookies; Collection and Use of Personal Information

When you visit our website, we send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.  Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some of our website’s features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

For each visitor to our website, through use of cookies, our web servers collect the Internet domain and Internet address of the computer you are using as well as essential technical information such as identification of the page or service you are requesting, type of browser and operating system you are using, and the date and time of access, but not the e-mail address of visitors to our web page and sites.  This information is recorded in the web server access log files.  We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as how people search.  This information may be used for the purpose of evaluating website usage, compiling reports on website activity for internal use and providing other services related to website activity and internet usage.  We use third party service providers who assist us in aggregating and analyzing the data we collect from you and other website visitors and who may use your data to improve their services (for example, displaying customized content or advertising based on your use preferences, auditing, research and analysis to maintain, protect and improve their services, ensuring technical functioning of their network, and developing new services).  These service providers may share aggregate, non-personal information with third parties.

Suffolk University collects the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail and those who make postings to our chat areas.  Optional information is collected only if you choose to send it.   For example, if you e-mail Suffolk University, choose to complete an online form or make an online purchase, Suffolk University will collect the information you volunteer, such as your e-mail information, survey information and/or site registrations and/or information you record in online forms. This may include:

  * The time that you sent an e-mail. 
  * Your name, e-mail address, and the content of your e-mail. 
  * All the data you choose to fill in or confirm, including credit or debit card information if you are making a payment or donation, as well as information about other people if you are ordering a gift and want it sent directly to the recipient’s address.



Suffolk University uses personal information collected through our website to administer programs in which users have enrolled and to send program and marketing and promotion-related information to users.  In addition, Suffolk University will analyze user information in aggregate form to assess its programs and determine its plans for the future.  Except as set forth herein, Suffolk University will not use any personally identifiable information that it collects for marketing or promotional purposes and will not use personal information to contact visitors to our website for any purpose unless necessary for the enforcement of this Privacy Policy or Suffolk University’s policy on the use of the Suffolk University website or the suffolk.edu domain.

Suffolk University does not intend to collect any information directly from children under the age of 13.  If you are under the age of 13, you may use the Suffolk University website only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.  In the event that Suffolk University learns that it has inadvertently collected information from a child under the age of 13, any and all such information will be promptly deleted from Suffolk University’s systems.

Suffolk University will share personally identifiable information about you when one or more of the following conditions apply:

  * We have your consent to share the information; or
