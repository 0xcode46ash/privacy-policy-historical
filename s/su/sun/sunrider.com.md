# privacy policy

Sunrider ("Sunrider" or "we") is serious about protecting your privacy -- whether you are a Distributor, Club Member, Customer, or just a visitor to our Web sites, including but not limited to, sunrider.com, shop.sunrider.com, and business.sunrider.com (collectively referred to herein as the "site"). We realize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. That is why we have put a policy in place to protect your personal information.

_ INTERPRETATION: _

The original text of this Privacy Policy is in English and any interpretation of it will be based on the original English text. In the event of a conflict between different translations of this Privacy Policy or any documents or notices related thereto, the original English version will prevail.

_ INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW IT IS USED _

  1. __ We use information collected about you only to process orders and to make the site a more useful and valuable service. 
  2. __ When you place any order, information you send us is secure.
  3. __ We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission.
  4. __ If you choose, you can browse the site without entering any personal information and remain completely anonymous during your visit.
  5. _ To Process Your Order _ : If you place an order on our site, we require your full name, billing address, telephone number,e-mail address, and shipping address, which you provided to Sunrider at the time you signed up as a Distributor, Club Member, or Customer. In order to finalize your order, you will be required to enter your credit card information. We use this information solely to process your order and, if any questions should arise, to contact you about your order. The only third parties that receive any of this information are those parties necessarily involved in the processing of your order: the financial institution that issued your credit card (your credit card information) and the shipping carrier that delivers your order (your name and shipping address). _ Cookies and Information We Automatically Collect Via Your Distributor ID _ : In order to place an order or utilize the business management functions on the site, you must log on with your Distributor ID number. Your Distributor ID number is linked to your existing profile, which contains information you provided to Sunrider when you signed up as a Distributor, Club Member, or Customer (full name, billing address, telephone number, e-mail address, and shipping address). When you enter the site, your browser places a "session cookie" onto your computer's Random Access Memory, which enables the site to determine the country and language of your visit. If you log on to the site with your Distributor ID, the Session Cookie will include your ID for identification purposes only. No personal information such as your name, address, telephone number or credit card information is stored in the Session Cookie. Furthermore, when you exit the site and close your browser, the Session Cookie will immediately disappear from your computer's Random Access Memory. If you set your browser to disable cookies, you will be unable to access and utilize the site. Sunrider does not use "Persistent Cookies" on the site. For more information on Cookies and their uses, please refer to <http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm>
  6. _ Collection of Visitor Information _ : Sunrider stores the IP (Internet Protocol) address, the time and date of entry, and the specific pages viewed by each visitor to the site. Sunrider also stores the Distributor ID of visitors that log on with their Distributor ID number. This information is maintained for security purposes only, and will not be disclosed to third parties.
  7. _ Required Disclosures _ : We may also disclose information obtained through the site when necessary to comply with a court order, to comply with the request of a government agency or regulatory body, or if we receive your request or permission to do so.



_ LOST OR STOLEN INFORMATION _

You must promptly notify Sunrider if your credit card, user name, and/or password is lost, stolen, or used without your permission. In such an event, we will remove that credit card number, user name, and/or password from your account and update our records accordingly.

_ SECURITY _

When you place an order online, your personal and credit card information is scrambled using SSL Encryption technology before being sent over the Internet. This makes it virtually impossible for your information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred through cyberspace to Sunrider's internal network, which exists behind a state of the art firewall. Your credit card number will be used only for payment processing, and will not be retained for marketing purposes. Sunrider has purchased its SSL Encryption software from VeriSign, the world leader in SSL Encryption technology. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure and while we make every effort to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its complete security. We make no assurances about our ability to prevent any loss, misuse, or alteration of the information that we obtain from you, and we will have no liability to you or to any third party arising out of any such loss, misuse, or alteration. Because security is as important to us as it is to you, we will continue to search for and implement the most advanced security measures available in order to ensure the security of your personal information.

_ YOUR CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY _

By signing up online as a Distributor, Club Member, or Customer and ordering SunriderÂ® products, you consent to the collection and use of the above-referenced information by Sunrider. If you do not agree to the terms contained in this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the site. To keep up-to-date with Sunrider's Privacy Policy, please check this page frequently. Your continued use of the site after any modifications will constitute your acknowledgment of the modified policy and your agreement to be bound by it. _We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time without notice._
