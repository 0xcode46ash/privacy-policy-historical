# Privacy & Confidentiality - Sunnybrook Hospital

At Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, we are responsible for personal health information under our control and are committed to a high standard of privacy for our information practices. We are committed to ensuring that staff and patients understand the importance of privacy rights and obligations.

The Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) balances an individual's right to privacy with the need of health care providers to access and share this information. PHIPA gives an individual the ability to control how his/her own personal health information is collected, used and disclosed.

  * Records of your visits to Sunnybrook and the care that you received during those visits. 



Occasionally, we collect personal health information about you from other sources, if we have obtained your consent to do so or if the law permits.

#### We may collect, use or disclose personal health information for the purposes of:

  * Providing health care or assisting in providing health care to an individual;
