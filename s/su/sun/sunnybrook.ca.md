## **Personal Health Information Protection Act**

Ontario’s Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) came into effect on November 1, 2004. This Act establishes legal requirements for the collection, use and disclosure of personal health information. This page is intended to provide you with information about Sunnybrook’s compliance with PHIPA.

## **Collection of personal health information**

We collect personal health information about you in order to provide you with health care or assist in the provision of healthcare to you by other healthcare providers. We may collect this information either from you directly or, in some circumstances, from a person designated to make care decisions on your behalf. The information that we collect may include your name, date of birth, address, health history, and other records of your visits and the care that you received either at Sunnybrook or from other healthcare providers.

## **Permitted uses and disclosures of personal health information**

In accordance with PHIPA, we may use and disclose your personal health information:

  * To treat and care for you.
  * To receive payment for your treatment and care (e.g. from OHIP, WSIB, your private insurer, or others payors).
  * To conduct risk management activities.
  * To conduct quality improvement activities
  * For teaching purposes.
  * To conduct research.
  * To compile statistics.
  * For fundraising purposes to improve our programs and services.
  * To comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
  * To fulfill other purposes as permitted or required by law.



## **It's your choice**

Where your consent is required for any collection, use or disclosure of your personal health information, you may withdraw or withhold consent by contacting Sunnybrook’s Privacy Office.

## **Our pledge to protect your personal health information**

  * We will take steps to protect your personal health information from theft, loss or unauthorized access, copying, modification, use, disclosure or disposal.
  * We will take steps to ensure that anyone who performs services on Sunnybrook’s behalf respects your privacy rights and only uses or discloses your personal health information for permitted purposes.
