APN Newspapers Pty Ltd uses cookies on its websites. Cookies are pieces of information that a website can transfer to an individual's computer hard drive for tracking user navigation and customising site information to further improve the user experience. Cookies can make using APN Newspapers Pty Ltd's websites easier, for example by storing information about your preferences on a particular website. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you'll find most major websites use them. Typically, cookies involve the assigning of a unique number to the visitor and the information collected through cookies is on an aggregate and anonymous basis. One simple way to prevent the use of cookies it to activate the facility which is available in most web browsers that enables the user to deny or accept cookies.

We also collect personal information in the normal course of business including names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. This information is collected through meetings, phone calls, letters, fax, email, as well as commercial agreements, documents and dealings. This information is subject to the National Privacy Principles and is only used for the purpose for which it was provided. Generally this is limited to the transaction of general business.

APN Newspapers Pty Ltd will not collect sensitive information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or details of health, disability or sexual activity or orientation unless:  
a) the subject of the information has consented; or  
b) the collection is required or specifically authorised by law; or  
c) the collection is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of any individual, where the subject of the information is physically or legally incapable of giving consent; or  
d) the collection is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim. However, if we do, it will usually be for the purposes of providing our goods or services and if the law requires us to, we will seek your consent to collect it.

**How we use your information**

Your information will only be used for the purpose for which it is collected and for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose of collection, and we will not disclose it without your consent. APN Newspapers Pty Ltd generally uses personal information, and you consent to us using your personal information, to:  
a) provide you with products or services you have requested, or for purposes necessary or incidental to the provision of goods or services to you;  
b) help APN Newspapers Pty Ltd manage and enhance its services;  
c) communicate with you; or  
d) provide you with ongoing information about opportunities in which APN Newspapers Pty Ltd believes you may be interested.

The information and feedback you provide through our website may be used to identify ways of improving the site and how we can make it more effective for your use.

**Opting in or out**

At the point we collect information from you, you may be asked to “opt in” to consent to us using or disclosing your personal information other than in accordance with this policy or any applicable law. For example, you may be asked to opt-in to receive further information or communications from our advertisers and supporters.

You will generally be given the opportunity to “opt out” from receiving communications from us or from third parties that send communications to you in accordance with this policy.

If you receive communications purporting to be connected with us or our services that you believe have been sent to you other than in accordance with this policy, or in breach of any law, please contact us at on the details set out below.

**Is your personal information shared with anybody outside of APN Newspapers Pty Ltd?**

Any personal information collected through the website is contained and access is restricted to the authorised personnel of APN Newspapers Pty Ltd and its related bodies corporate, and contractors responsible for the maintenance of the website.

Your information may be shared with third parties as explained below:

**Related bodies corporate**

We may share information about you with related bodies corporate so we can provide you with the products and services you request and bring you information about products and services we offer.

**Companies who provide Services to us**

In some cases we contract with other companies or individuals to provide services for us. Examples of these may include deliveries, market research, public relations, debt collection agencies, legal advisors, auditors etc. We provide them only with such information about you as they need to perform their services and we impose strict requirements of security and confidentiality on them in how they handle your personal information. We make it very clear that they are not permitted to use information about you for any other purpose except to perform the services we have asked them to provide.

**Access and correction**

Where APN Newspapers Pty Ltd holds personal information about you, we will provide you with access to the information on request. There are some exceptions to this set out in the Privacy Act. We may charge a fee to cover the costs of meeting your request.

Where providing access would reveal evaluative information generated within APN Newspapers Pty Ltd in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process, APN Newspapers Pty Ltd may give you an explanation for the decision, rather than direct access to the information.

If APN Newspapers Pty Ltd holds personal information about you and you are able to establish that the information is not accurate, complete and up-to-date, we will take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up-to-date.
