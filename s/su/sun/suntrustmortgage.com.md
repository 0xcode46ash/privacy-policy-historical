# SunTrust Mortgage, Inc.

Perhaps nothing is more important than safeguarding your financial information. SunTrust recognizes the sensitive nature of this information, and takes every precaution to ensure your privacy. When you entrust us with your financial information, you can be certain it will be used only in an appropriate manner. 

This policy statement is designed to explain what type of information SunTrust collects, how it is used, and with whom and under what circumstances it will be shared. 

#### What Information Do We Collect?

For loan applications and new account forms, information regarding your financial status such as employment, income, monthly expenses and assets generally comes directly from you voluntarily, in person, by mail, or through our web site. 

For credit and repayment history, SunTrust utilizes third party sources such as credit bureaus and other creditors. We also obtain demographic and household information from specialized database information firms. 

SunTrust also maintains information about your transactions with SunTrust including account balances, securities holdings, repayment history and other information. 

#### How Do We Use This Information?

Primarily, the collected information is used to perform basic banking business functions and to provide superior customer service. The information also allows us to offer specific products and services that we believe will be the most useful to you. 

#### Who Has Access To This Information?

SunTrust employees are permitted access to the information they need to perform their jobs. SunTrust maintains strict internal policies against unauthorized disclosure or use of customer information. 

As a diversified financial services company, SunTrust has a number of separate bank and non-bank subsidiaries. Information held by one SunTrust entity is available to other SunTrust affiliates for authorized purposes, unless a customer has specifically requested otherwise. (See "Affiliate Sharing" below for more information.) 

Sometimes, we will also make the names, addresses and other identifying information about selected customers available to our business partners outside of SunTrust who can provide a beneficial service to our customers. These business partners must agree to keep the information we provide confidential and not to share it with any other party. 

In accordance with standard banking industry practice, and as provided for under applicable federal and state law, SunTrust routinely provides information about our transactions and experiences with customers (in particular about loan repayment experience) to credit bureaus and other creditors. 

In addition, there are certain federal and state statutes that require disclosure of information about our customers. For example, if a customer is involved in litigation with a third party, a court may order SunTrust to disclose information to a court or another litigant. In such circumstances, only the specific information required by law, subpoena or court order will be disclosed. 

#### Affiliate Sharing

As mentioned above, to help us provide the best possible service, we generally share information about customers among the various subsidiary companies owned by SunTrust Banks, Inc. However, if you prefer not to have certain pieces of your information shared with other SunTrust affiliates, you may request that we not do so by writing to us at: SunTrust Banks, Inc., Customer Information, P.O. Box 4418, Mail Code 5027, Atlanta, Georgia 30302. When you write to us, please include your name as it appears on your accounts with us, as well as your address and social security number. Your request will become effective within 12 weeks of receipt. It is important to note that information about specific transactions and experience with a customer will still be shared with affiliates and others as permitted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

#### Use of Our Internet Web Site

Our user-friendly Internet web site (www.suntrust.com) invites customers to provide information about themselves through our [Guest Book](https://web.archive.org/web/20001213080200id_/http%3A//www.suntrustmortgage.com/privacy.stm), as well as other information request screens from the privacy of their own personal computer. 

The personal information you provide to us over the Internet allows us to respond quickly to your questions about our available products and services. We will also use this information to furnish you with information and suggestions about other products and services we believe may be of interest and benefit to you. 

SunTrust’s internal security standards safeguard your personal information submitted by computer in several ways. Encryption helps protect your private data from interception by a third party. We have also installed passcodes and other safety features to ensure the information you provide us on the Internet is safe and secure. (For more information, please see the [Security and Contact Info](https://www2.suntrust.com/security.html) page on our web site at <https://www2.suntrust.com/security.html>.) 

#### A Word About "Cookies"

To enhance customer service, SunTrust will occasionally use a "cookie" on our Internet web site. A cookie is a piece of information that a web server can store on your PC and retrieve later. 

There are several beneficial reasons for using cookies. One reason is to give you the opportunity to enter your personal information, like your password, just one time. That way, you don’t have to enter the information each time you access our site. Cookies do not contain any information that will enable anyone to contact you via telephone, e-mail or regular mail. 

#### Links to Privacy-Related Web Sites

If you would like to learn more about privacy issues, you may wish to visit the Federal Trade Commission’s web site at:

#### Thanks for Choosing SunTrust.

Whether it’s on the Internet, in person, via telephone or mail, we at SunTrust are committed to protecting your privacy. And you can rest assured we will continue to provide you with the most up-to-date safeguards possible to ensure the safety of your personal financial information.
