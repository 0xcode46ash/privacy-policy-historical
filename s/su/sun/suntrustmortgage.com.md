# SunTrust Mortgage, Inc.

At SunTrust, we recognize the sensitive nature of your personal financial information, and take every precaution to protect your privacy. When you entrust us with your financial information, you can be certain it will be used only within our strict guidelines. 

We’ve prepared this policy to explain what types of information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may share it. It covers all the members of the SunTrust Banks, Inc., corporate family, including SunTrust Bank, SunTrust Mortgage Corp., SunTrust Securities, SunTrust Equitable Securities, Trusco Capital Management, SunTrust Personal Loans, Inc., SunTrust Bankcard, N.A., and SunTrust Online, Inc. and all other subsidiaries of SunTrust Banks, Inc. 

We hope you will read through all the details of SunTrust's official position on privacy. At the very least, however, we want you to know that SunTrust uses information we know about you responsibly to: 

  * provide you with the services you've requested. 
  * offer you other bank products and services. 
  * alert you to financial services products made available by our carefully-selected marketing partners. 

Under no circumstance do we provide account or personal information to non-SunTrust companies for the purpose of independent telemarketing or direct mail marketing of any non-financial products or services of those companies. 

This policy statement takes precedence over any previous privacy policies issued by SunTrust Banks, Inc., or any of its subsidiaries. 

#### What kinds of information we collect.

**If you apply for a loan or a new account:** We ask you to provide information about your financial status, such as employment, income, monthly expenses, and assets. In most cases you give us this information yourself, in person, by mail, or through our web site. If we need to know about your credit and repayment history, we use third-party sources such as consumer reporting agencies and other creditors. 

**Once you become a customer:** We maintain information about your transactions with SunTrust and its affiliates, including account balances, securities holdings, repayment history, and other information. Because it’s important to know what types of services may be most valuable to you, we also obtain demographic and household information about current and prospective customers from specialized marketing information firms. 

#### How we use this information.

Most of the information we collect is used for only one purpose: to help us deliver the services you’ve requested, easily and efficiently. It may also permit us to design and offer specific products and services that we believe will be useful to you. 

#### Who has access to this information.

**Within SunTrust:** SunTrust employees are permitted access to the information they need to perform their jobs. We maintain strict internal policies against unauthorized disclosure or use of customer information. 

As a diversified financial services company, SunTrust has a number of subsidiaries offering a wide variety of services such as mortgage banking, securities brokerage, insurance sales, leasing and consumer finance, and many others. As permitted by law, information held by any SunTrust subsidiary is available to other members of the SunTrust corporate family for authorized purposes, unless a customer has specifically requested otherwise. (See “How to opt out of having information disclosed.”) 

**Marketing partners:** From time to time, we carefully select business partners to provide our customers with specialized financial services such as credit cards or insurance. Although these partners are not owned by or affiliated with SunTrust, they work closely with us to help us meet all of your financial needs. If appropriate, we may disclose to these core partners certain information such as: 

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as your name, address, Social Security number, assets, or income; 
  * Information about your transactions with SunTrust and its affiliates, such as your account balance or payment history; 
  * Information obtained from specialized marketing information firms, such as household demographics; and 
  * Information we receive from consumer reporting agencies and others, such as your creditworthiness and credit history. 

Our partners must agree to strictly safeguard the confidentiality of customer information, and they are not allowed to disclose this information to anyone else without our permission. Customers may request that SunTrust not share their information with our marketing partners, as described in the next section. 

**Other outside marketers:** We sometimes make limited customer information available to other companies that we believe can offer you a helpful financial service. This may include your name, address, phone number, and other identifying information you’ve provided us on applications or other forms. These outside marketers must agree to keep your information confidential and not to share it with anyone else. You may choose not to have your information disclosed to these companies. 

**Outside service providers:** At times, we enter into arrangements with companies whose expertise is essential for our own services to function properly. For example, we work with specialized firms that execute securities transactions, enable online banking, and generate account statements for SunTrust customers. As permitted by law, we disclose to these service providers the customer information necessary to perform these functions. As with all our business partners, these companies are required to safeguard your information and use it only for authorized purposes. 

**Consumer reporting agencies:** In accordance with standard banking industry practice, and as allowed under federal and state law, SunTrust routinely provides data about customer loan repayment and other transactions to these agencies and other creditors. 

**Courts and government entities:** Certain federal and state statutes may require us to disclose information about you. For example, if you are involved in litigation with a third party, we may be ordered to provide information to a court or the other litigant. In these circumstances, only the specific information required by law, subpoena, or court order will be disclosed. 

**A note about former customers’ information.** Although we generally don’t solicit customers who have closed their accounts with us, we may share their information with SunTrust affiliates, marketing partners, and other third parties as described above. Former customers have the same opt-out privilege as active customers. If you opt out of information-sharing as a SunTrust customer, this request will stand even if your relationship with us ends. 

#### How to opt out of having information disclosed.

By making customer information available to other companies owned by SunTrust Banks, Inc., and to carefully selected third-party firms, we’re able to provide better service and offer financial solutions we believe you will value. In fact, some products and services are available only if you allow us to share your information. 

For example, if you have chosen to have overdraft protection on your checking account linked to your credit card issued by one of SunTrust's non-affiliated partners, we must share information with that partner in order for the service to function. If you restrict access to information about yourself and your accounts, we may be unable to provide all the financial services you need. 

If you prefer, you may direct us not to disclose personal information about you that isn’t publicly available. Just call our automated Customer Privacy Request Line toll-free at 1-800-432-9472 or write to us at: 

SunTrust Banks, Inc.  
Customer Information  
P.O. Box 4418  
Mail Code 5027  
Atlanta, GA 30302  


If you write us, please include your name as it appears on your accounts with us, as well as your address, Social Security number, and account numbers. Each owner of a joint account must opt out separately, although both parties may notify us in the same communication. An opt-out request becomes effective within 30 days of receipt. 

You should also know that even if you opt out of information disclosure, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other laws allow us to share with our affiliates and other companies specific details about your transactions and experience with us, including information about your account balances or payment history. 

#### How we protect your privacy online.

Our user-friendly Internet web site, [ www.suntrust.com](http://www.suntrust.com/), invites you to tell us about yourself through our [ Guest Book](https://web.archive.org/web/20011024122138id_/http%3A//suntrustmortgage.com/privacy.stm). We also usually ask for some personal information when you request assistance from us. This allows us to respond more quickly to your questions, and possibly suggest other services we think you may be interested in. (For more information on the use of our website, please see the [ User Information](https://www2.suntrust.com/userinfo.html) page.) To protect this information, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations. 

**Security:** When you submit this private data to us over the Internet, our internal security standards guard it in several ways. Encryption helps protect it from interception by a third party. The passcodes and other safety features we’ve installed also help ensure that the information you provide us remains safe and secure. (For more information, please see the [Security and Contact Info](https://www2.suntrust.com/security.html) page.) 

**Confidentiality:** No one has access to this information except employees who provide services to you. 

In addition, you should know about these online information management tools that may offer additional convenience: 

**Cookies:** To simplify your online experience with us, we may place a “cookie” on your PC while you’re visiting our web site. (A cookie is a piece of information that our web server stores on your computer’s hard drive and retrieves later.) This helps us recognize you the next time you visit our site, saving you the bother of re-entering a password or other personal information each time. We do not use cookies to record information that will enable anyone to contact you via telephone, e-mail, or regular mail. 

**Third-party aggregation services:** To help you keep tabs on accounts at a variety of institutions more easily, online aggregation or “screen-scraping” services are available at little or no cost from SunTrust and a number of other firms. Here’s the way they work: 

  * You give the service provider the passwords or other access keys to your various accounts at banks, brokerage houses, and other institutions. 
  * The service provider then collects statement information from these institutions’ web sites on your behalf, and aggregates all this information in a single online statement. 
  * Some services also allow you to initiate online payments or other transactions. 

Before you grant any company access to your account information, we recommend finding out how it will collect and safeguard your data. Consumer protections may vary depending upon the nature and identity of the aggregator. In any event, if you allow third parties to access your personal information, SunTrust can accept no responsibility for their actions or for any losses that may result. 

#### We respect your privacy.

As technology continues to advance, you can be sure SunTrust will provide the most up-to-date safeguards possible to keep your personal financial information confidential and secure. Your trust is important to us – and we’re committed to protecting your privacy, whether you do business with us on the Internet, in person, or via telephone or mail. As always, we thank you for choosing SunTrust.
