Sunbelt Software Privacy Statement

Thank you for visiting Sunbelt Software. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this site. 

**Electronic Email Lists**  
Your subscriber information is kept strictly confidential. We occasionally send our subscribers e-mail messages with special offers only from qualified, relevant businesses and organizations, but your email address is never sold to other companies.

**Secure Shopping & Registration Guarantee**  
The purchase and registration areas of our site (OnLineShop) are secure. This means that any information you send us is protected by encryption to prevent unauthorized access to your information. It's easy to tell when you are protected by encryption -- the lock or key at the bottom of your browser changes color or is no longer broken. This varies depending on your browser. You will also notice that the http in the url has changed to https (meaning a secure site).

**Cookies**  
To enhance your experience with our site, some of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, by registering at our site. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our site). We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services. 

**Our Commitment to Security**  
We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.
