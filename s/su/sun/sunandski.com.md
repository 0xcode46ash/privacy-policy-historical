| | 

Thank you for reviewing our policies regarding any personal information you may choose to provide at our website. We take your privacy very seriously and carefully protect any and all information entrusted to us. We only collect information that helps us serve you better and that you voluntarily provide. We do not share your information with anyone else unless you've approved of such sharing in advance.

Privacy Policy Guideline

Sun & Ski Sports respects your online time and privacy. 

Sun & Ski Sports is committed to respecting your privacy and recognizing your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information you share with us (the phrases "personally identifiable information" or "personal information" mean any information by which you can be identified, such as your name, address, telephone number, etc.). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you what personally identifiable information or personal information we may collect from you when you visit our web site, how we use such information, and the choices you have regarding our use of and your ability to review and correct the information. This policy applies only to users accessing our web site from the United States.

As a part of our commitment to your privacy, Sun & Ski Sports supports and adheres to the guidelines and practices adopted by the Direct Marketing Association's "Privacy Promise to American Consumers." We have agreed to (1) provide customers with notice of their ability to opt out of information regarding rental, sale or exchange with other marketers; (2) honor customers' requests not to share their information with other marketers; and (3) honor customers' requests not to receive mail, telephone or other solicitations from Sun & Ski Sports.

**Collecting Information About You**

 ****

In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous, unless you voluntarily tell us who you are.

There may be times (such as when you subscribe to a service, register to receive catalogs, or to participate in contests, sweepstakes or promotions, etc.) at which we ask you to provide certain information about yourself, such as your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, email address, birth date, gender, occupation, personal interests, etc.  Whether or not to provide such information is completely your own choice. If you choose not to provide the information we request however, you may be unable to access certain services, offers and content on our web site or featured in our direct marketing communication.

**Using Information About You**

We use the personally identifiable information you provide for internal purposes such as subscription or registration, analyzing trends and statistics, informing you of our new products, services and offers, etc. From time to time we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities that we deem trustworthy and whose privacy policies are consistent with ours. In many cases we might share, sell, or rent information, including personally identifiable information about you, that will enable such persons or entities to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you.

We may combine information you give us online, in our stores or through our multiple points of contact to serve you better. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us and to communicate with you by mail, and in certain cases via email, about our products and events that may be of interest to you.

Although unlikely, in certain instances we may disclose your personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to Sun & Ski Sports or to others. Sun & Ski Sports also may disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe the law requires it.

**Editing, Updating, Correcting and Deleting Information About You**

We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer not to receive information from us or from our Select Partners, please let us know by calling us at 281-340-5000 or by sending us an email, at info@sunandski.com. Please be sure to include your email address, full name, and specifically what information you do not want to receive. If you would like to update or correct your email address, street address or other personal information with us, please contact us the same way.

_Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to 6-8 weeks to be effective, particularly if we are removing your name from postal mailings._

Please remember, if you delete certain information, you may not be able to continue to purchase products or access other portions of our web site without entering additional information.

**Security**

We use sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of your personal information that you share with us. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our web site; and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we will do our best to protect its security on our systems.

**Links to Third Party Sites**

Our web site may contain links to web sites operated and maintained by third parties over which we have no control. Privacy policies on such linked sites may be different from our privacy policy. You access such linked sites at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a linked site before disclosing any personal information on such site.

**Policy Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy in whole or in part, we will inform you by posting a notice on our web site. Those changes will go into effect on the date posted in the notice. The new policy will apply to all current and past users of our web site and will replace any prior policies which are inconsistent.
