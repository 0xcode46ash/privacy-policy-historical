# Sunsuper Privacy Policy

At Sunsuper* we aim to provide members with the best possible service and in doing so we are committed to protecting your privacy and the security of your personal information.

This document sets out our policies and procedures in relation to the management of the personal information we collect.

### What does 'personal information' mean?

Personal information is any information about you from which you can be identified or by which your identity can be reasonably determined.

### What information do we collect and why do we collect it?

When you join the Sunsuper Superannuation Fund ( **Fund** ), or when you make a benefit payment request or an insurance claim, you will need to provide us with personal information, which may include:

  * your name and residential address, date of birth, gender, phone and other contact details, occupation and employer,
  * insurance related information such as your medical history, salary information and other health information, and/or
  * bank account or other financial institution details where a benefit is to be paid.



The collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by Sunsuper is essential to enable us to conduct our business of offering and providing our range of products and services.

Your identification details are used to process your application, manage your participation in the Fund, ensure that you receive your entitlements from the Fund, provide you with information about your superannuation benefits from time to time and to ensure that we comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.

Your insurance-related information is collected so that your eligibility for death and disability insurance can be assessed. If you make a claim for a disability benefit, more information may be collected about your disability in order to assess your eligibility for the benefit.

During the time you are a member of the Fund we will hold investment-related information about you including the amount of your superannuation contributions (including rollovers, employer contributions, salary sacrifice contributions and spouse contributions) and your investment preferences.

When a benefit is due to be paid to you or a beneficiary, Sunsuper is required by law to confirm that you or the beneficiary are the person to whom the benefit belongs. We do this by asking you or the beneficiary to provide acceptable identification documents.

If you die, we will need personal information about persons who are entitled to be considered for distribution of the death benefit. This includes your spouse, children, any other dependant, and any person who might be a beneficiary of your estate. The information we will ask for about those persons will include their name and residential address, gender, date of birth, details of their financial position and financial needs, and any other information that will assist us in deciding to whom the death benefit should be distributed. On your death, we normally collect information about potential beneficiaries from the beneficiaries themselves. However, we will also collect some information about the identity of potential beneficiaries from your executor or administrator or whoever notifies us of your death.

### How do we collect personal information?

We collect information about you through your Membership application form, Benefit payment request form and through various other forms. Some information (e.g. change of address) can be provided by you over the phone. Some information about you is collected from employers. When you join Sunsuper, your employer may provide us with your name, address, birth date and Tax file number.

When a benefit is payable, employers provide us with details of the date of termination of employment. Employers may also notify us of updated address details from time to time.

If you make a claim for a disability benefit, most of the information about the disability is collected from you directly, but information may also be collected from doctors and other experts and sometimes from your employer. New members are asked to give their consent to information being collected from these other sources if they make a claim for a disability benefit.

### How do we use information we collect?

Generally, we only use personal information that we collect from you for the purpose of managing your participation in Sunsuper, and for meeting our legal and regulatory obligations. We may also use the personal information we collect to occasionally notify you about:

  * important changes to Sunsuper and its products,
  * other new products which you might find valuable, or
  * products offered by other parties we believe you may be interested in.



We give new members the option to nominate not to receive direct marketing communications. You can also exercise this option each time information of this type is sent to you.

### Do we disclose your personal information to anyone?

Sunsuper may disclose your personal information in certain circumstances. Generally, we do not disclose your personal information to a party outside the Sunsuper group unless that party is contracted to Sunsuper to provide administrative services or other activities on our behalf and that party is bound by the same privacy rules we follow.

Some examples of who we may disclose your personal information to and the reason for disclosure, are:

  * Sunsuper's administration service provider, for the purposes of administering the superannuation fund.
  * Mail service providers, for the mailing of member statements and other information.
  * Insurers, insurance assessors or medical practitioners, for the purpose of the assessment of claims for insurance benefits or request for insurance cover.
  * Legal advisers and other experts, if there is a dispute about a benefit.
  * Regulatory and legal bodies, as required by law (e.g. Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) or a Court of law).
  * Auditors, in order to assist them in conducting their independent audit and review activities of Sunsuper's financial statements and operations.
  * Third parties, if you give us permission to do so (e.g. a financial planner with whom you are dealing).



### Can you access the personal information we hold about you?

You may request access to any of the personal information we hold about you. A summary of personal information such as your name and address details, contact phone numbers, insurance cover and superannuation accounts you have with us, is available to you by calling us on 13 11 84.

Sunsuper is required under law to retain your personal information for a period of time after you have ended your relationship with us, which in some cases can be for several years. When it is no longer necessary to hold your personal information in our archiving system we attend to the secure destruction or deletion of your personal information.

### How do we protect your information and ensure it is accurate?

We have systems, practices and procedures in place to protect your privacy. The people who handle your personal information have the training, knowledge, skills and commitment to protect your personal information from unauthorised access or misuse.

To ensure that the information we hold about you remains accurate, complete and up-to-date, we may ask you to check and correct your personal details from time to time. We may do this when your Annual member statement is sent out or when you make a telephone enquiry.
