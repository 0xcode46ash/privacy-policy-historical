# Sun Run - Privacy Policy

| 

This privacy policy applies to information collected on this Sun Run website. This policy does not apply to information we may collect in other forums, including through emails or offline. 

Certain features on our site may request personally identifiable data from you ("Personal Information"), which may include your name, e-mail address, company name, or other personal information such as your address, fax or telephone number. 

We use the information you submit as described on our site, to respond to your request, or to otherwise help us in processing your request. We also use the information you submit for other business purposes, including, from time to time, using your email address to send you information about Sun Run Generation. Personal Information is used by Sun Run Generation to assist in serving you more effectively, to improve the content of our Web site, and communication with you. 

Sun Run Generation is not in the business of sharing your Personal Information with third parties. In certain circumstances, however, we may share your information with third parties, including if we believe we are legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties, where we are working with a vendor or business associate who is performing functions on our behalf, or if we are jointly providing services with a business partner. In the unlikely event that Sun Run Generation needs to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we may disclose any information about you to government officials as permitted by applicable law. 

Sun Run Generation uses standard security measures to protect information submitted on this site. We cannot guarantee, however, that our standard measures will not prevent a third party from circumventing our security measures and unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or where an error may occur in the administration of the site. We protect your information with the same degree of security we protect our own proprietary information. 

At any time you may request to correct your Personal Information or request that Sun Run Generation delete your Personal Information and no longer contact you either by e-mail, telephone, regular mail, or by any other means. To make any request described above, send an email to [info@sunrunhome.com](mailto:info@sunrunhome.com). When contacting us, please be sure to provide us with your exact e-mail address, name, address and/or telephone number(s) in order to be sure we handle your request correctly. 

While the Sun Run Generation site occasionally will provide a hyperlink to a third party's site, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites, and encourage you to read the site's privacy policy before submitting any personally identifiable information. 

By using this site, you are agreeing to the terms set forth in Sun Run Generation's Privacy Policy. Sun Run Generation reserves the right, at its discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. If Sun Run Generation changes its privacy policy it will post the updated version of that policy here. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of this site following the posting of changes to this policy will mean that you accept those changes.
