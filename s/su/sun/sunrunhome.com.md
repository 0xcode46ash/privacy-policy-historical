# SunRun Home Solar Privacy Policy - SunRun

### SunRun home solar protects your privacy, whether you're just visiting our site or are a customer. 

#### Privacy Policy

Certain features and pages on SunRun's website ask for you to provide personal information, such as name, email address, address, or telephone number. We have adopted this privacy policy to describe our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information on our website.

#### Personal Information

“Personal information,” as used in this policy, is information that specifically identifies a person, such as a person’s name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. Personal information also includes information about a person’s activities, such as information about his or her activity on our website, and demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, and geographic location, when any of this information is linked to personal information that identifies that person.

Personal information does not include "aggregate" or other non-personally identifiable information, such as information that we collect about a group or category of users that is not personally identifiable, or a set of information from which individual identities are removed. We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes.

For example, we may disclose information about our home solar projects to third parties, such as organizations who are interested in promoting solar power adoption. This information includes the location of the solar project and certain information about it, such as its size. This information does not, however, include the customer’s name or any other personally identifiable information about our customer.

#### Use of Personal Information

Your privacy is important to us. We use personal information to determine whether home solar and SunRun's solar plans are right for you, to otherwise respond to your request, to improve, operate, and maintain our website and our products and services, to maintain a record of our dealings with you, and for other internal administrative purposes. Except in the limited circumstances described in this privacy policy, we will never give or sell your information to third parties without your consent.

We do not sell personal information about you to unrelated companies for their independent marketing purposes. We may disclose personal information to third-party service providers that assist us in our work (for example, companies who host our Web site, and companies that process payments on our behalf). We limit the personal information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and we do not permit them to use personal information for other purposes.

Additionally, personal information about our home solar financing customers or former home solar financing customers may be disclosed as we believe to be required by law, to protect our or a third party’s rights or property, or as we believe to be appropriate to respond to claims or other legal process.

Finally, In addition, information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, bankruptcy, receivership, or similar transaction in which personal information could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.

#### Future Correspondence

From time to time we may send you marketing, promotional, or educational information regarding residential solar. At any time you may request to correct your personal information or request that SunRun delete your personal information and no longer contact you by email, phone, regular mail, or any other means. Simply email info@sunrunhome.com, call us at 855-478-6786, or submit your request in writing to 45 Fremont Street, 32nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105. You may also use the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing and promotional email correspondences in order to opt-out from future promotional email.

Data Security

SunRun uses standard security measures to protect information submitted on this site. We protect your personal information with the same degree of security we protect our own proprietary information. Information on the customer log-in area of our website is encrypted through the use of SSL (AES-256bit encryption). Our SSL certificates are signed by VeriSign, Inc. Please be aware, however, that no data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal information or other information.

#### Third Party Sites

SunRun's website provides hyperlinks to third party sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites and encourage you to read the site's privacy policy before submitting any personally identifiable information.

#### Future Changes

By using this site, you agree to the terms set forth in this privacy policy. We may change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. If SunRun changes its privacy policy, we will post the updated version of that policy here. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of this site following the posting of changes to this policy will mean that you accept those changes. For any revisions to this policy that are materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you and obtain your consent before implementing such revisions with respect to such information.
