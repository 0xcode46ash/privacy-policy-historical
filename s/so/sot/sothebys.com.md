## Web Site Usage Information

**Cookies**  
  
If you have permitted your computer to accept “cookies,” we may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies track where you travel on our Web Site and what you look at, transact and purchase. They may store the information in your shopping cart, and/or your username and/or password, and wemay use them to deliver specific messages to you (for example, to announce anew feature that was added since the last time you visited the Web Site). A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Web Site to other information about you, including your Personal Information. All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Web Site.

Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Web Site or certain areas or features of the Web Site.

**Clear GIFs**  
  
We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixeltags") or similar technologies, in the Web Site and/or in our communications with you, to enable us to evaluate Web Site Usage Information about visitors to the Web Site, target campaigns, upgrade visitor information,and know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIFis typically a one-pixel transparent image (although it can be a visible imageas well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet thus enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message. A clear gif may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.

**IP Address and Clickstream Data**  
  
Our server automatically collects data about your server's Internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, orIP Address, is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you're on the Internet. When you request pages from our Web Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes yourdomain name. Your IP Address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information about our customers as a whole. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Web Site; the Web site you visit after this Web Site; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Web Site or a referral site;and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems withour server, to administer our Web Site, and to customize your user experience. Such information may also be used to gather demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider. We may link this information with your Personal Information.

Any or all of these activities with regard to Web Site Usage Information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers, including, for example, our analytics vendor(s) and our e-mail management partner(s). 

**How is your Personal Information used?**  
  
We will use the Personal Information you provide to our Web Site, for example,to respond to your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings.

We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record keeping. We may also report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Web Site Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including third parties. We also may compare your contact information to data in our worldwide databases in order to improve our Web Site and marketing.

In order to alert you to the widest possible number of items and events of interest to you from our sales and events worldwide, we may share thisinformation among our affiliates in The Sotheby's Group.

You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. ****

**Phishing**  
  
With identity theft a continuing problem, it has become increasingly common for unauthorised individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line merchant, requestingthat the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, thedomain name of the e-mail address from which the e-mail appears to have beensent, and the domain name of the web site requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such sensitive information is received by an unauthorised individual to be used forpurposes of identity theft. This illegal activity has come to be known as"phishing." 

Sotheby’s will never request your password or social security number via e-mail. If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information (including your Web Site password or credit card information) via e-mail or to a web site that does not seem to beaffiliated with our Web Site, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us. ****
