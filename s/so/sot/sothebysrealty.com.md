**What information do we gather about you? How do we use it?**

 _When you visit or browse our site._

An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet so that your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as "Web servers," that "serve up" Web pages. We use your IP address or the location of your computer on the Internet to help diagnose any problems with our servers and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and gather demographic information. This demographic information does not include your name, your address or any other personally identifiable information. Most of the information collected is technical information about the type of computer, operating system, and browser you are using. We may share aggregated statistics, not linked to any individual, about browsing and response patterns with our marketing partners and affiliates. We do NOT use cookies (which are small pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer for purposes of saving your preferences) to store personal preferences about you. We do not ask you for, and do not receive over our Web site, information to enable you to apply for or obtain financial products or services or which relate to a transaction involving a financial product or service, or information about any of your credit cards, debit cards or other accounts. 

_When you communicate with SIR._

When you send a communication inquiring about a property or services, SIR will need to know your name, e-mail address, the area in which you are looking to purchase or sell property and certain other information. These communications may be directed to an SIR sales associate or an affiliate agent. Over the course of time, you may develop a relationship with such persons. They may send you information or marketing materials on SIR properties or services.

 _When you communicate with Sotheby's Lehman Mortgage Services._

When you send a communication inquiring about SLMS your information will be utilized only by SLMS internal staff to respond to your request. Any personal information that you provide in the SLMS Contact Us form will not be saved beyond your initial inquiry, and will not be used for any other purpose. 

**Security**

All communications between you and our systems occur on our secure server. At SIR and SLMS, as throughout the entire Sotheby's group of companies, we consider our client's personal information to be confidential and have implemented processes in order to attempt to limit access to it to employees who need to know specific information.

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to the Sotheby's International Realty/Sotheby's Lehman Mortgage Services Web site and not to any site to which our site may link and with which we may or may not be affiliated.
