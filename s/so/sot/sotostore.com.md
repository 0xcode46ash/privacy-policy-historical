# Soto Berlin Online Store - Privacy Policy

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully.

  We collect information about you for two reasons: firstly, to process your order and second, to provide you with the best possible service. If we send you an e-mail in the future, we will give you the chance to refuse any further marketing email from us in the future. From time to time we may send you marketing messages in the post, if you prefer not to receive these please let us know.

  The type of information we will collect about you includes: your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. We do not share this information with any other company or organisation. We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent.

  Online payments are handled securely by PayPal, and as a result we do not store credit/debit card details from online transactions. The security of your information, transactions, and money is the top priority at PayPal. PayPal Fraud Protection Services leverages the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which provides crucial online identity and security to help establish trust between parties involved in e-commerce transactions. You can be assured that this website is genuine and that the information you send stays private and confidential.

  Using SSL with an encryption level of 128 bits (the highest level commercially available), PayPal automatically encrypts your confidential information from your computer to PayPal's servers, which are heavily guarded both physically and electronically. These servers sit behind a monitored electronic firewall and are not connected directly to the internet, so your private information is available only to authorised computers.

  You can check the information that we hold about you by emailing us here. If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct them promptly.

  We may use technology to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to our site. This can include using a "cookie" which would be stored on your browser. You can usually modify your browser to prevent this happening. The information collected in this way can be used to identify you unless you modify your browser settings.

  If you have any questions/comments about privacy, please email us via our contact page.
