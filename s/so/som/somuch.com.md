**I respect your privacy, because I like my privacy.  
**I'm just like you - I hate it when I'm required to give my address, phone number, or any other personal information just to use some simple little item.  Lately the trend has been to make you a 'member' before you can even do anything. I think sites sometimes ask for information they don't need just because everyone else seems to be doing it.

Lets face it, unless you want to give me your Swiss Bank account numbers or the combination to your wall safe, I really don't want any information from you other than what I need. For any of the features that require information such as the mailing list etc. I will only ask for the minimum that is needed. Some third-party features such as somuch.net email and the storefronts (coming soon...) might not adhere to this policy but that is out of my control.

I guess the this statement should cover it all. **We won't ever give, sell, or trade any visitor information - period, nada, zip, finito!** _Any feature that requires you to enter information will also give you the option to opt out in the future - your record will be deleted at that time - no information will be saved anywhere._
