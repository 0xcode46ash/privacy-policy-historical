  1. **Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)**  
We collect PII (such as your name, email address, or phone number) when you provide it to us for the purposes of communication with the company (e.g., by using our [contact form](https://web.archive.org/web/20110623063827id_/http%3A//contact/) or commenting on [our blog](http://blog.sociomantic.com/)). When we receive this information, we use it to respond to your inquiry, request, or comment, and then we store the information for a reasonable time to complete correspondence and keep a record of communications.We do not combine your PII with the non-PII data we store in our _sociomantic_ Sonar or third party cookies (more below). We will never share your PII with non-affiliate third parties unless obligated by the national law of the Federal Republic of Germany or international governance. 

If you would like to update or delete the PII we have on file, please feel free to email us.

  2. **Anonymous data (non-PII)**  
Our website, [www.sociomantic.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20110623063827id_/http%3A//), places small text files on your internet browser called [cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). Cookies store non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) about your web browsing behaviors both on our site and after you leave our site. We use cookies for three purposes:



I) _Website Customization:_ these cookies can remember your preferences (e.g., your login status on our customer pages) to make your experience with our website more personalized and streamlined.

II) _Website Analytics:_ these third party cookies help us analyze our web traffic to improve the effectiveness of our website. They collect information such as your browser type, when you came to our site and which pages were visited, and what country you’re browsing from.

III) _Online Advertising:_ these are our _sociomantic_ Sonar cookies, which enable us to serve you more relevant advertisements as you surf the web. They collect information such as the websites you visit after you leave our site and your clickstream activity on those sites. (More details in the following section.)

In all three cases, we may share this anonymous data with third parties. Read the “Controlling the use of your information” section below to learn about how you can manage your cookie preferences.

**Online Advertising Privacy Policy**

Our technology helps our clients to deliver more relevant online advertisements using a range of ad targeting methods that depend on cookies to aggregate data about user behaviors on the web. If you’re interested in learning more about how these technologies work, we’d recommend starting at these sites:

  * IABEurope’s [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) site (EU)
  * IAB’s [Privacy Matters](http://www.iab.net/privacymatters/) site (learn about online behavioral advertising)
  * Digital Advertising Alliance’s [AboutAds](http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/) site (U.S.-based self-regulatory initiative)



The information we aggregate is never attached to or combined with any PII without user consent, and is delivered anonymously and securely to our partners and clients for the purposes of online advertising. If you are not interested in seeing more relevant online advertisements delivered by our technology, please scroll down to the “ **Cookie Control** ” or “ **Opt Out** ” sections below to learn about how you can control the collection and use of non-PII for your browser.

  1. **Types of anonymous information collected  
**Our targeting technology collects only non-PII data.  This anonymous data is stored as small files ([cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)) that are saved to your web browser to help us collect information such the websites visited by your browser, the advertisements clicked, items viewed in an online shop or added to an online shopping basket, etc. We also collect information on the performance of the ads delivered, for example how many times an ad was shown, whether or not it was clicked, or if that click resulted in an online purchase.
  2. **How is information used?**  
The information we collect is used to help make the ads you see more relevant to you. We do this by showing you ads based on your previous online actions and other dimensions we have assigned to your browser based on the non-PII we have collected. This helps to reduce the amount of “spam” advertisements you see as you browse the web, and it enables advertisers to connect to people who would be most interested in their offering. It also helps web publishers to make more money from the ad spaces they have to sell, so they can continue to offset their production costs and provide valuable content to you – many times for free.
  3. **Storage and retention of data ******_  
sociomantic labs_ has taken reasonable measures to encrypt and keep secure the all of the data we collect. This data is stored for a finite amount of time within the bounds of German law and in compliance with international standards.

We will never share your PII with non-affiliate third parties without your consent. Non-PII data collected by our technologies may be shared with our clients and partners for the purposes of delivering targeted online advertisements or aggregated user insights.  The provision of your personal data to government institutions is only possible within the framework of the national law of the Federal Republic of Germany or in compliance with international governance.
  2. **Children**  
We never knowingly collect personal information about users under the age of 13 or from pages targeted to users of this age group. In the event that it is brought to our attention that personal information about a person under the age of 13 has been collected, we will take reasonable measures to remove this information from our system.
  3. **Sensitive information  
**We never collect sensitive information such as financial account numbers, Social Security numbers, pharmaceutical prescriptions, or medical records.
