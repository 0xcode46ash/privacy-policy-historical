### Scope of Privacy Policy & Terms and Conditions

This Policy is intended to cover all programs and publications of Society for Science & the Public including, but not limited to, the Intel Science Talent Search (known as the Westinghouse Science Talent Search until 1998), Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (also known as “Intel ISEF,” or “ISEF”), the Broadcom MASTERS (known as the SSP Middle School Program or Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge), SSP Fellows Program, SSP’s Alumni and Membership Programs, and SSP publications, such as _Science News_ and _Science News for Kids_.

From time to time, SSP may apply a more stringent version of this Policy for an individual program, including those referenced above. Please refer to the specific privacy information related to those programs.

Our websites are intended for a general audience (students, parents and teachers) and are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information online from children under 13.

This Policy also applies to each of the Websites on which it is posted: www.societyforscience.org, www.sciencenews.org, and www.sciencenewsforkids.org.

### Collected Information

There are many instances where an individual may provide SSP with personal information. These include but are not limited to: students applying to participate in an education program (e.g. Intel Science Talent Search), an individual subscribing to one of our publications (e.g. _Science News_ ) or other communications (e.g. enewsletter or eblast), an individual participating in our digital badging program, or an individual who is a member/volunteer or who is interested in volunteering/becoming a member. Information that may be collected includes name, address, city, state, zip code, email address, date or year of birth, grade level, username and/or password. For entrants in the Intel ISEF, Intel STS, and BCM, SSP also requests social security number and ethnicity, but providing this information is optional. If an entrant wins a monetary prize for participating in SSP competitions, the entrant will be required to provide their tax identification number to process payment in accordance with IRS rules.

Users may use the Websites without registering, but registration must occur in order to use any of the personalized web services.The Websites’ registration form requires specific contact information, including, but not limited to, name, address, and e-mail address. Users’ contact information is used to learn more about our Users and to contact Users when necessary.Unique identifiers are collected to verify a User's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system.

The following guidelines set forth our practices for handling your personal information.

### Education Program Applicants, Entrants, and Finalists

SSP currently administers programs that typically engage students ages 13 and older. Any student providing information as part of an application, whether or not selected for a program, will have their information used for consideration of entry to the program and to send communications about the applied-for program and other SSP programs, membership and publications.

Applicants selected to participate in an SSP program will have their applicant information transferred to an Alumni Database following program participation. Those individuals may be contacted by SSP’s alumni program staff for participation in additional alumni activity. SSP may also contact alumni concerning other SSP programs, membership and publications.

Certain programs require SSP membership, and students cannot opt-out of communications with SSP that are related to participation in these programs.

### Subscribers, members, donors, “friends” and other commercial activity

Many individuals provide information in order to volunteer with SSP, receive the SSP Newsletter, the SN daily/weekly email blast or the SNK eblast or otherwise participate in or learn more about SSP programs and publications. For example, Users may be prompted for address information in order to subscribe to SSP publications, including, but not limited to, the SSP Newsletter, the _SNK_ eblast, and the _SN_ daily/weekly eblast and _Science News_. Address and other personally identifiable information will be stored as necessary to process and fulfill an individual’s gift, membership, subscription, or other commercial transaction. SSP may send solicitation and/or subscription offers along with these communications, subject to a User’s opt-out selection described below. This information may also be shared with other programs and publications of SSP or as otherwise described elsewhere in this Policy.

From time to time, SSP may rent subscriber information to third party organizations. If you would like us to remove your name from such lists, please contact us via mail, telephone or email address as provided for in the Third-Party Disclosure of Information found elsewhere in this policy.

### E-mail Communications

SSP sends email communications to current and past members, program participants, volunteers, subscribers, digital badge earners, and other individuals or organizations upon request. Every bulk email includes an “unsubscribe” link that will allow the recipient to either modify the frequency or type of communication, or to decline all future email communication from SSP. Removal from all lists may take up to five business days to complete. Replying directly to the email, rather than using the unsubscribe form, may require additional time to process.

The only instance where an “unsubscribe” link would not be included in the bottom would be an email sent as direct correspondence from an SSP staff person. Please respond directly back to that individual staff person if you would prefer to be removed from future communication.

### Internal uses

SSPmay collect information about the Users of the Websites in order to assist in determining which parts of the Websites visitors find most valuable.This allows SSP to continually improve the services it provides. For example, SSP may track the URL that Users visited before Users came to the Websites, the URL to which Users next go, as well as Users’ IP addresses. SSP may also use Users’ IP addresses to help diagnose problems with SSP’s servers and to administer the Websites.

### Cookies

Cookies are files that contain information created by a web server that can be stored on a User's hard disk for use either during a particular session ("per-session" cookie) or for future use ("persistent" cookie).SSP may use cookies to facilitate automated activity, store and trackSSP ID numbers, session status, and navigation patterns. Cookies are not used to disseminate significant information about Users over the Internet or to analyze any information that Users have knowingly or unknowingly provided. When a User registers, the system will ask whether the User approves of the attachment of a cookie.

Users may instruct their Internet browsers to opt out of accepting a "persistent" cookie and rather accept only a "per-session" cookie, but will need to login each time they visit the Websites to enjoy the full benefits. If the User declines the attachment of any cookie, the User may not have access to the full benefits of the website. Registration enables the Websites to better determine a User’s interest areas and provide the most relevant information.

### Third-Party Disclosure of Information/Opt-Out

SSP contracts with third-party companies to provide certain services on a User’s behalf. These services include credit card processing, printing services, mail distribution and processing, and other customer support services. Information provided to third-party service providers is strictly limited to the services required or as required by law.

SSP may use a User’s personally identifiable information to provide the User with promotional information about programs, services, events and publications offered by SSP or select third-parties, including sponsors and their advertising and public relations agencies. SSP may also share information with its sponsors and their advertising and public relations agencies.

From time to time, SSP may rent subscriber information to third party organizations. SSP closely reviews every request for information by third-parties to help ensure they are trustworthy and reputable, as determined by SSP in its discretion.

A User may opt-out of such sharing with third-party organizations or modify User’s communication preferences at any time by emailing privacy@societyforscience.org, by calling (800) 552-4412, or by mailing Society for Science & the Public, PO Box 1674 Williamsport, PA 17703.

SSP may also use aggregate data that is not personally identifiable in discussions, presentations, or reports to current or potential grantors. This data may include demographic, geographic or other broadly representative data.

SSP will divulge any information collected from a User on the Websites when required to do so by law.

### E-Commerce Security Practice

Maintaining the confidentiality of a User’s personal information is important to SSP.The Websites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that is under the control of SSP. Credit card numbers are used for the limited purpose of processing yourSSP subscription, registration, donation, membership, or other orders.When a User’s credit card information is transmitted toSSP for validation, it is secured by encryption technology, which enables information to be sent over the Internet in an encrypted form to ensure protection against unauthorized access to your personal information. Notwithstanding the above,SSP makes NO WARRANTY in respect of the strength or effectiveness of the encryption andSSP is not responsible for events arising from unauthorized access of the information you provide.

### Third Party Links

This policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information that SSP collects from Users. Although Users may link to other sites or third parties via the Websites, SSP is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties or the content of linked sites.

### Your California Privacy Rights
