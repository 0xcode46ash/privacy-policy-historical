**Germany kick off the World Cup with 4-2 win.** Â Hosts Germany won their first encounter in the World Cup against Costa Rica, in a game that produced six goals. Germany took the lead thanks to a wonderful shot just outside of the penalty box by Philip Lahm. Wanchope silenced the crowd a short moment later, when he scored the equaliser for Cost Rica. Then Miroslav Klose scored a brace to make it 3-1. Even when Costa Rica reduced to 3-2, Germany never looked threatened. Frings put the game in the books for Germany when he made it 4-2 in the 87th minute.
