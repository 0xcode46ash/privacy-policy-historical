Third Party CookiesThe use of cookies by our partners/affiliates is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

Widgets Widgets support functions that require that you disclose certain personally identifiable information given the user's choice of participation.

SecurityThe security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card information) on your online registration we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
