## Privacy Policy[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.socialtwist.com&sealid=101)

  


###### Our commitment to privacy

SocialTwist, Inc. ("SocialTwist", "we", "us" or "our") has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information about users of SocialTwist social marketing products and services and the SocialTwist platform (collectively, the "Services"). This privacy policy provides details about how your personal information is collected and used. Personal information is any information that identifies you or would enable someone to contact you, such as your name, email address, phone number and other non-public information associated with your individual identity. 

**Our Privacy Policy in short**

  * We will not disclose personal information collected from you other than as described in this policy.
  * We use the personal information we collect from you only in connection with providing the Services to our customers.
  * We will not sell, rent or share personal information about you with third party marketers or others without your consent.



Use of Personal Information to perform Services

We provide social marketing tools for our customers, which enable visitors to our customer's sites or sites we host for our customers, to share information about the customer's site with friends, using email and social networking sites. 

**If you are a customer** , we may require you to provide personal information about yourself when you register to use the Services. Such information may include your name, billing address, email address, registered domain and payment information so that we may process your order and establish your account. Upon registration, you will receive an order confirmation by email. 

We do not sell, rent or share customer personal information with third parties. We do not sell customer lists to marketers.

We may contact you by email regarding your orders and our Services. You may elect not to receive commercial marketing messages from us about the Services.

We do not store any credit card numbers in our system except to process and transmit the information for payment processing. If you enter your credit card information to place an order, that information is encrypted and transmitted immediately for processing and authorization. Once the transaction is authorized, we delete the credit card information from our system, provided that if the Services you purchase require recurring billing, your information is encrypted and maintained by our payment processing provider.

We may assign you a user ID and password to use the Services. We assume no responsibility for preventing third parties (other than our own employees) from using your login credentials, whether with or without your permission.

Our customer list is an asset and trade secret of SocialTwist, Inc. and may be transferred with the company's assets in connection with any merger, acquisition or change of control of the business of the company.

If you sign up for our affiliate program, we use your business contact information to communicate with you regarding the program and ours Services.

**If you are a visitor to a customer's site** or a site hosted by us for a customer and you elect to share content or information from the site with your friends using our Services, you may be prompted to enter an email address and password, a social networking account ID and password, or other credentials in order to use our “tell-a-friend” widget or other Services.

We do not market, sell or rent your email address or social networking account ID to third party marketers.

If you tell someone about a customer's site using your email account, you will have to enter one or more friends' email addresses. A one-time email will then be sent to your friend(s) inviting them to visit the site. We do not collect, share or store your friends' email addresses. You may also access your email address book using the Services by selecting your address book service provider and entering your user ID and password. Only those friends that you select will be sent an email. We do not store your email account password or your contact lists.

To refer friends to a customer's site using a social network, blog or bookmarking site, you will be asked to enter your account ID and password so that the content you want to share can be posted by you. We do not market or sell any personal information you provide to access and post content to social networks, blogs or bookmarking services.

We collect statistical data regarding the use of our Services which we use in our business. Such data may include non-personally identifiable information such as your computer IP address which we use for statistical demographic research, such as to determine the number of tell-a-friend messages directed to particular cities, states and countries. Such data also may include, for example, how many tell-a-friend messages are sent by you, which social networking or other channels are used, how many friends open the message, how many people click on the message, and how many clicks result in a purchase, signup or download.

We may provide our customers with reports about the use of our Services including such statistical data. Our reports do not include personal information that can be used to identify or contact you, unless you have expressly agreed to share such information by checking the appropriate boxes or otherwise opting-in on any site using our Services.

You may have the opportunity to opt-in and participate in certain programs involving rewards and benefits offered by our customers, such as Tell-a-Friend-for-Rewards contests. When you use these Services, we may collect, store and forward your name, email address or other personal information to the contest sponsor. Each customer/sponsor is responsible for any further use of your personal information as well as operation of the contest or other rewards program. Use of your personal information by a customer may be governed by contest rules or privacy statements established independently by each customer. We assume no responsibility for a customer's use of personal information you submit for the purpose of participating in contests and rewards programs.

Cookies and Other Sites

When you access our website, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called "cookies" on your computer.

We send a "session cookie" to your computer when you log in to your account. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we don't need to ask you for your password on each page. Once you log out or close your browser, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect.

We also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to display your e-mail address on our sign-in form, so that you don't need to retype the e-mail address each time you log in to your account.

We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website and Services.

This Privacy Policy applies to www.socialtwist.com and we are not responsible for the privacy policies, practices or contents of any third party websites.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
