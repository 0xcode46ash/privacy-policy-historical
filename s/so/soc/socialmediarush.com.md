**What information do we collect?**

In the event that you purchase any of FansPronto.com services, the only information we collect is your username or url and basic information from paypal (name, phone number, address, etc).

 **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.

We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

 **What is the privacy policy change and enforcement rules?**

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.
