####  Information You Submit 

User Generated Content. As part of our Services to our Clients, we provide Consumers the ability submit reviews, comment on or rate goods, products and services on websites within the Annex Cloud Network (collectively, “User Generated Content”).

Therefore, please do not include any information within these areas that you do not want to share with the general public, including personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address or financial information. Annex Cloud uses User Generated Content for providing the Services to our Clients, marketing research, new product development, to personalize or improve our Services, to detect fraudulent activities and for analytical purposes. 

Consumer Account Info. In order to submit User Generated Content, you will have to create an account with the Annex Cloud Client whose products, services or goods you are reviewing or rating.
