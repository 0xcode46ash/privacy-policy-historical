# United Media Partners Privacy Policy

## United Media Partners, Inc.

### PUBLIC PRIVACY POLICY

#### OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY

United Media Partners, Inc. ("UMP") is committed to maintaining the security, confidentiality and privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy documents our on-going commitment to you and has been developed in compliance with relevant privacy legislation.

#### SCOPE OF POLICY 

This Policy addresses personal information about individuals only; it does not apply to information collected, used or disclosed with respect to corporate or commercial entities. However, corporate and commercial information is protected by other UMP policies and practices and through contractual arrangements.

This Policy does not impose any limits on the collection, use or disclosure of the following information by UMP:

  * business contact information; or 
  * publicly available information. 



#### ACCOUNTABILITY

UMP is accountable and responsible for personal information under its control. UMP has designated a Privacy Officer to oversee UMP's compliance with this Policy.

Ultimate accountability for UMP compliance rests with the UMP's Board of Directors who delegate day-to-day accountability to the Privacy Officer. Other individuals within UMP may be accountable for the day-to-day collection and processing of personal information or to act on behalf of the Privacy Officer.

UMP has adopted procedures to protect personal information, receive and respond to complaints and inquiries, train staff regarding privacy policies and procedures and communicate policies and procedures to you upon your request.

#### PURPOSES

When collecting information, UMP will state the purpose of collection and will provide, on request, contact information for the Privacy Officer who can answer questions about the collection.

UMP collects your personal information for the following purposes:

  * to communicate with you through the SOCIALBOX™ Application or in respect of the SOCIALBOX™ Application;
  * to monitor your compliance with any of your agreements with us;
  * to process any of your offers, acceptances, and bid payments;
  * to provide and administer products and services requested and to use and disclose the information for any purpose related to operation of accounts and provision of requested products and services;
  * to provide personal information to third party suppliers of products and services;
  * to protect UMP, yourself and others from fraud and error and to safeguard the business interests of UMP;
  * to authenticate your identity;
  * to obtain quotations to provide products and services requested by you;
  * to comply with legal and regulatory requirements; and
  * to distribute to third parties including financial institutions, payment processors, landlords, lawyers, financial institutions and government licensing bodies for any of the above purposes.



UMP may be required by law to obtain social insurance numbers in order to report income or interest payments to the Canada Revenue Agency.

The above collections, uses and disclosures are a reasonably necessary part of your relationship with UMP, its (other) distributors and suppliers.

Other uses:

  * UMP may use your personal information to offer additional or alternate products and services to you and may add your personal information to customer lists which they prepare and use for this purpose.
  * UMP may share your personal information with its distributors, suppliers and reputable third parties so that they may offer their products or services to you.
  * UMP and any of its distributors may contact you for survey or seminar invitation purposes.



You may instruct UMP to refrain from using or sharing your personal information in any or all of the four ways described above at any time by providing written notification to our Privacy Officer. UMP acknowledges that the sharing of your personal information in any or all of the four ways described above is at your option and UMP will not refuse you access to any product or service merely because you have advised UMP to stop using or sharing your personal information in any or all of the four ways shown.

When your personal information is to be used for a purpose not previously identified, the new purpose will be disclosed to you prior to such use, and your consent will be sought unless the use is authorized or required by law.

#### CONSENT

UMP will obtain your consent to collect, use or disclose personal information except where UMP is authorized or required by law to do so without consent. For example, UMP may collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge or consent where:

  * UMP is collecting or paying a debt;
  * UMP is obtaining legal advice; or
  * UMP reasonably expects that obtaining consent would compromise an investigation or proceeding.



Your consent may be express or implied, or given through an authorized representative such as a lawyer, agent or broker.

Consent may be provided orally, in writing, electronically, through inaction (such as when you fail to notify UMP that you do not wish your personal information collected/used/disclosed for optional purposes following reasonable notice to you) or otherwise. For example, oral consent could be expressed over the telephone when information is being collected; electronically when submitting an agreement, application or other information; or in writing when signing an agreement or application.

You may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions, provided you give reasonable written notice of withdrawal to UMP. Upon receipt of your written notice, UMP will inform you of the likely consequences of the withdrawal, which may include the inability of UMP to provide certain products or services for which the delivery of that information is a prerequisite.

#### LIMITS ON COLLECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION

UMP will not collect personal information indiscriminately and will limit its collection of your personal information to what is reasonably necessary to provide a product or service either directly or indirectly and which is reasonably necessary for the purposes to which you consented. UMP may also collect information as authorized by law.

#### LIMITS FOR USING, DISCLOSING AND RETAINING PERSONAL INFORMATION

Your personal information will only be used or disclosed for the purposes set out above and as authorized by law.

UMP will keep personal information used to make a decision affecting an individual for at least one year after using it to make the decision.

UMP will destroy, erase or make anonymous documents or other records containing personal information as soon as it is reasonable to assume that the original purpose is no longer being served by retention of the information and retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.

UMP will take due care when destroying personal information to prevent unauthorized access to such information.

#### ACCURACY

UMP will make a reasonable effort to ensure that personal information it is using or disclosing is accurate and complete. In most cases, UMP will rely on you to ensure that certain information, such as your street address, e-mail address or telephone number, is current, complete and accurate.

If you demonstrate the inaccuracy or incompleteness of personal information, UMP will amend the information as required. If appropriate, UMP will send the amended information to third parties to whom the information has been disclosed.

When a challenge regarding the accuracy of personal information is not resolved to your satisfaction, UMP will annotate the personal information under its control with a note that a correction was requested but not made.

#### SAFEGUARDING PERSONAL INFORMATION

UMP protects the personal information in its custody or control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks.

UMP will take reasonable steps, through contractual or other reasonable means, to ensure that a comparable level of personal information protection is implemented by its suppliers and agents who assist in providing products and services to you.

Please note that confidentiality and security are not assured when information is transmitted through e-mail or other wireless communication.

#### OPENNESS

UMP is open about the policies and procedures it uses to protect your personal information. Disclosure of our policies and procedures will be made available in writing and electronically. However, to ensure the integrity of our security procedures and business methods, UMP will not disclose sensitive information about its policies and procedures.

UMP will make available a description of the type of personal information held by UMP, and a general description of its use and disclosure.

#### PROVIDING ACCESS

You have a right to access your personal information held by UMP.

Upon written request and authentication of identity, UMP will provide you with your other personal information under its control, information about the ways in which that information is being used and a description of the individuals and organizations to whom such information has been disclosed.

UMP may charge a reasonable fee for providing personal information in response to an access request and will provide an estimate of any such fee upon receiving a written access to personal information request. UMP may require a deposit for all or part of the fee.

UMP will make personal information available within 30 days or provide written notice where additional time is required to fulfill the request.

In some situations, UMP may not be able to provide access to certain personal information. This may be the case where, for example, disclosure would reveal personal information about another individual, the personal information is protected by solicitor/client privilege, the information was collected for the purpose of an investigation or where disclosure of the information would reveal confidential commercial information that, if disclosed, could harm the competitive position of UMP. UMP may also be prevented by law from providing access to certain personal information.

Where an access request is refused in whole or in part, UMP will notify you in writing, giving the reason for refusal and outlining further steps which are available to you.

#### COMPLAINTS

UMP will, on request, provide information regarding its complaint response procedure. Any inquiry, complaint or question regarding this Privacy Policy must be directed in writing to our Privacy Officer, whose contact information is:
