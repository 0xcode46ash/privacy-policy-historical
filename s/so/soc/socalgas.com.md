Southern California Gas Company (“SoCalGas”) is committed to keeping our visitors informed about how we use the information we gather on our website at www.socalgas.com (the “website”). By using our website or obtaining any product or service through our website, you agree to the collection and use of information as set forth in this policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use the website.

Please be aware that other sites accessible through SoCalGas’s website have their own privacy policies and data collection, use, and disclosure practices. The information practices of those other sites linked to SoCalGas’s website are not covered by this privacy policy.

In order to better provide you with products and services, SoCalGas’s website collects two types of information: Personal Information and Non Personal Information.

**Personal Information:** “Personal Information” refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are and can be used to identify, contact, or locate you. You may choose not to provide any Personal Information and you will still be able to access most portions of the website. However, Personal Information may be collected from visitors seeking to obtain services offered by SoCalGas on this website, such as:

  * Enrollment in and use of My Account for purposes such as bill payment;
  * Applications regarding possible employment;
  * Enrollment in CARE or other customer assistance programs;
  * Applications for energy efficiency program participation, rebates, and incentives; and
  * Requesting to be included on mailing, email, texting, landline telephone, or cellular telephone lists of SoCalGas, as may be described in more detail on this website from time to time. Additionally, online communications relating to utility services may also require follow-up contacts (such as emails, texts, and telephone "call backs") and responses regarding the services to be utilized - including billings and payments.



Examples of Personal Information you may submit include your name, mailing address, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, and other identification and contact information. We may also collect certain financial account information (if you choose to provide it), as well as other types of information that you may have entered into employment applications. In the event that you apply to the CARE program, you may also be requested to disclose your enrollment in other governmental programs (such as food stamps/SNAP, Supplemental Security Income, and the National School Lunch Program).

SoCalGas uses this Personal Information to provide services, conduct its business, and improve our visitors’ experience on our website.

**Non Personal Information** : “Non Personal Information” refers to information that does not identify a specific individual by itself or in combination with other Non Personal Information. SoCalGas may collect Non Personal Information by using cookies, clear GIFs, or through the collection of traffic data.

**Cookies:** SoCalGas’s website may send cookies to your computer or other device to allow us to monitor the individual’s use of the site. No attempts are made to identify individual users unless actions are taken to identify yourself by an “opt in,” for example:

  * Individual services are requested;
  * Application is made regarding possible employment;
  * Inclusion on a SoCalGas mailing list is requested;
  * Illegal behavior or unauthorized activities are suspected; or
  * User identification is required under law.



Cookies are used to improve the usefulness of our website for our visitors.

**Clear GIFs** : At times, we work with third party service providers that employ clear GIFs (also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs, web beacons or action tags). Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are used to track the online movements of our users. We also use clear GIFs to gather and compile information so that we may better customize our services to you. Clear GIFs may identify individual users in combination with previously provided Personal Information.

**Traffic Data:** SoCalGas ** ** automatically collects and maintains statistical information from our website’s data logs that concern website activity, navigation, network traffic flow, and volume (“Traffic Data”). Examples of Traffic Data include the following:

  * Name of the domain, or URL, from which the visitor accesses the Internet (e.g., "a company.com"; "a school.edu"; or "an agency.gov");
  * Internet Protocol (“IP”) Number;
  * Type of web browser used;
  * Web pages visited; and
  * Date and time this website is visited.



Our primary purpose for collecting Traffic Data is to optimize the usefulness to visitors of our website. Traffic Data is also helpful in permitting us to improve the overall user experience on our website. Traffic Data may identify individual visitors in combination with previously provided Personal Information.

SoCalGas will not, without your consent, share your Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes except that SoCalGas may share your Personal Information with third-parties, including certain affiliated companies (consistent with applicable laws and regulations) or other trusted businesses solely in order to enable them to perform services for SoCalGas related to SoCalGas’s own business purposes (subject to confidentiality and security obligations).

**Law Enforcement** : SoCalGas may also disclose Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us or to protect or defend the rights, property, or safety of our users, others, and ourselves. SoCalGas may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personal Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personal Information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. SoCalGas fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. SoCalGas reserves the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.

**Mergers and Acquisitions _:_** In the event of a merger, consolidation, or sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoCalGas, one of the assets that would generally be transferred is the information we collect from our visitors and customers (including both Personal Information and Non Personal Information). However, the use of this information by any successor entity would still be governed by the terms of this policy, as amended from time to time, including any amendment after such transaction.

SoCalGas uses commercially reasonable efforts to prevent third parties from acquiring, altering, or destroying information made available to SoCalGas through this website. These efforts include monitoring network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information and under some circumstances encrypting sensitive information using Secure Socket Layers (“SSL”) or other comparable technology. Monitoring also occurs to prevent any activity that is illegal, or which may subject SoCalGas to legal liability or damage. SoCalGas is committed to maintaining the website’s security and its ongoing compliance with law so that this service will remain available to all visitors.

Although SoCalGas takes commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized third parties from acquiring Personal Information submitted to SoCalGas on this website, an unlawful interception or acquisition by a third party may still be possible.

SoCalGas does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13 years of age. Additionally, we are not aware of any content on our website that would be considered harmful to children. If SoCalGas learns that we have inadvertently gathered Personal Information from children under 13, we will erase such information from our records and terminate the applicable account.

This website may provide links to various governmental, industry association and other third party websites or materials. These links are provided for information purposes only. SoCalGas does not endorse any advice, goods or services offered by third parties. To the extent third party materials contain assertions of fact, recommendations, or any other interpretations or advice, the third party is solely responsible for the content of the third party site, and SoCalGas makes no representation as to the accuracy, completeness or fitness for any purpose or use thereof.
