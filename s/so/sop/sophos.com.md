## What personal data does Sophos collect?

In general, you can visit Sophos on the Internet without telling us who you are or giving any personal information about yourself. However, when you enquire about, order, evaluate or start using our products or services; register for virus information alerts or for one of our training programs or when you enter a competition, you may be required to provide personal data such as your name, company position, address, telephone number, mobile number, fax number, email address, credit card details and age. If you forward information to us electronically or as a hard copy, we will collect that information and use it for the purposes for which you have provided it. We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent.

Every time you connect to the Site, we store a log of your visit that shows the unique number your machine uses when it is connected to the Internet - its IP address. This tells us what your machine has looked at, whether the page request was successful or not and which browser your machine used to view the pages. The use of this data is primarily for statistical purposes. This helps us to understand which areas of the Site are of particular interest and also which pages are not being requested. It also tells how many people are visiting the Site in total. We may attempt to contact you through these details if necessary, including, without limitation, when you are using the wrong paths to access the Site or are breaching restrictions on the use of the Site. We may also use this information to block IP addresses where there is a breach of the Terms and Conditions for use of the Site.

## Cookies

A cookie is a piece of text that gets entered into the memory of your browser by a website, allowing the website to store information on a user's machine and later retrieve it. Some Sophos pages use cookies so that we can better serve you when you return to the Site. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the onsite experience. Cookies are in no way linked to any personally identifiable information. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use the Site, although some areas may be functionally limited.

Except when you explicitly request otherwise, we may keep this information on file for future reference.

We may also use your personal data to carry out research. Your personal data may be aggregated with data received from other survey submissions. This research is conducted for our internal business and training purposes and will improve our understanding of our user's demographics, interests and behaviour.

All emails sent to you by Sophos will follow the email guidelines described above. In keeping with these guidelines, if you have requested not to receive email communication from Sophos, we may also share your contact information with third parties to ensure you also do not receive email communication from them on behalf of Sophos.

We may also provide your personal data to companies outside our group, associated companies, our partners or authorised resellers; that may or may not be located outside the European Economic Area in order to provide you with information about other products or services.

Except as set out above, we will not disclose your personal information except where we are obliged to do so or allowed to do so by law, or where we need to do so in order to run our business (for instance where we outsource services or other people process data for us). If you do not wish us to pass your information to any other companies, please let us know by sending an email to us at [customerservice@sophos.com](mailto:customerservice@sophos.com).
