### Sophos privacy policy

#### General

This is the privacy policy of Sophos Plc ("Sophos").

We, at Sophos, want to safeguard the privacy of visitors to our website ("the Site"). Please read the following policy to understand how we use your personal data. Our privacy policy may change from time to time, so please check it whenever you give us personal data.

Whenever you give us personal data, you are consenting to its collection and use in accordance with our privacy policy. We will not share your personal information for marketing or any other purposes without your consent unless required by law.

#### What personal data does Sophos collect?

In general you can visit Sophos on the internet without telling us who you are or giving any personal information about yourself. However, when you start using our products and services, when you enquire about, order or evaluate our products or services, when you register for virus information alerts, when you register for one of our training programs or when you enter a competition you may be required to provide some personal data such as your name, company position, address, telephone number, mobile number, fax number, email address, credit card/debit card details and age. If you forward information to us electronically or as a hard copy, we will collect that information and use it for the purposes for which you have provided it. We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission.

Every time you connect to the Site, we store a log of your visit that shows the unique number your machine uses when it is connected to the internet - its IP address. This tells us what your machine has looked at, whether the page request was successful or not and which browser your machine used to view the pages. The use of this data is primarily for statistical purposes. This helps us to understand which areas of the Site are of particular interest and also which pages are not being requested. It also tells how many people are visiting the Site in total.

We would also attempt to contact you through these details if necessary including without limitation where you are using the wrong paths to access the Site or are breaching any restrictions on the use of the Site. We may use this information to block IP addresses where there is a breach of the Terms and Conditions for use of the Site.
