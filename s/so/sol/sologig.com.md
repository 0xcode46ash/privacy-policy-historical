# Sologig - Privacy

|  |  |    


###  Personal Information 

Sologig collects personal information from users on a voluntary basis only. This information allows us to provide users with private and secure areas to post and modify their original content on our site (e.g., profiles and projects). We do not sell our users' personal information, to anyone for any reason. All users should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal information (such as their email address), that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties, for which Sologig is not responsible. 

###  Credit Card Security 

CareerBuilder.com employs the highest level of encryption for secure credit card transactions. To read about this feature in greater detail, [click here](https://web.archive.org/about_us/security.php). 

###  About Cookies 

At Sologig, we use cookies only for the protection and convenience of our users. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to login repeatedly. If a user's system is idle for more than an hour, however, the cookie will expire, forcing the user to login again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access to the user's information while they are away from their computer.
