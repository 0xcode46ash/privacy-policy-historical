# Privacy Policy | Solar Quotes | Power, Panels, Rebate, Installers

**The details of our privacy policy are below. But here are our 4  Golden Rules:**

_"If you ask for 3 quotes, your information will only be provided to a maximum of 3 solar power companies who serve your area. Each installer is only allowed to use your information to give you a solar quote._

_If you check the box saying you are looking for finance we will provide your information to Parker Lane  to contact you about your solar finance options. We will only do this after you submit your request for a quote and you have consented to being contacted by Parker Lane. Parker Lane is a trading name of Upside Downside Pty Ltd Australian Credit License number 482276, and has appointed us as its corporate credit representative. Our credit representative number is 482276_  _. We will receive a fee for a successful referral to Parker Lane  which results in a loan. Parker Lane is required to disclose any fee payable to us in their documentation to you.  _

_We hate spam as much as you do. We will never pass your information on to anyone except the 3 solar installers and Parker Lane unless you give us your explicit permission to do so._

_We will send you emails walking you through the solar buying process, asking you for feedback and may send updates on the solar industry and occasional offers that we think may be of interest to you. Every email will have a prominent unsubscribe link if you don't want to receive them any more."_

**And here's the full monty:**
