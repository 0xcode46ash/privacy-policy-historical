# Privacy Policy | Soludos

#### privacy policy

Please also visit our Terms of Use section that explains other terms governing the use of our website.  Thank you for accessing the website (the "Site") of Soludos, Inc. ("Soludos," "we" or "us"). At Soludos, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information. To learn more, please read this privacy policy that follows (the "Privacy Policy").

This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information we may collect, how we may use this information and when (under certain circumstances) we may disclose this information. This Privacy Policy also details the steps we have taken to secure your personal information. By visiting our Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We are not responsible for the content on, or privacy practices of, any non-soludos.com web site to which this Site links or that links to this Site.

#### information collection

Soludos collects both personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. A non-exhaustive list of examples of such information are name, shipping and billing addresses, phone number, email address, credit card information and customer preferences data. Examples of ways in which we may collect such information from you include the following:

  * Registration and Ordering. Before using certain parts of this Site or ordering products, you must complete a registration form. When registering, you will be prompted to provide certain personal information, including but not limited to your name, shipping and billing addresses, phone number, email address, and credit card number. In addition, you may also be asked to provide your country of residence and/or your organization's country of operation, so we can comply with applicable laws and regulations, and for your gender. These kinds of personal information are used for billing purposes, to fulfill your orders, to communicate with you about your order and this Site, and for internal marketing purposes. If we encounter a problem when processing your order, we will use the personal information to contact you
  * Email Addresses. Some areas of the Site allow you to enter your email address for purposes including, but not limited to opening a Soludos account.
  * Cookies. Like most other websites, Soludos uses cookie technology throughout this Site. A cookie is a small removable data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer. Cookies are used to provide customers with tighter security, customized content, tracking of orders and shopping cart items. Unfortunately, customers who turn off cookies in their browser settings will not be able to shop from this Site.  THIS SITE'S COOKIES DO NOT AND CANNOT INFILTRATE A USER'S HARD DRIVE TO GATHER A USER'S CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Our cookies are not "spyware."



#### information use

  * We may share, aggregate or summarize non-personally identifiable information regarding our customers with partners, advertisers or other third parties.
  * We may share information with companies that provide support services to us (such as a printer, mailing house, fulfillment company or web host) or that help us market our products and services. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.
  * We will use your personal information to communicate with you about your orders and deliveries, and we may send you a confirmation email when you register/place an order with us. Also, if you submit your email address to open a Soludos account, we use it to deliver the information to you.
  * We may be required to disclose such information in response to subpoenas, court orders, requests from law-enforcement officials, or if we are otherwise required to disclose such information by law.
  * We may publicly disclose the name, city, and state of the winner of any online sweepstakes.



#### protecting your information

Shopping on the Site is easy, secure and worry-free. We have taken several measures to guarantee that your order and your credit card information are safe and secure. Our servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced encryption technology that works with Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 3.0 and above), Netscape Navigator (versions 2.0 and above), and AOL (AOL 3.0 and above), and the Site’s security has been tested & verified by McAfee Secure Sign.

SSL is considered the industry standard and is among the leading software available to encrypt online transactions. Your personal information including your name, credit card number and address is encrypted so that it cannot be read as it is transmitted over the Internet. Regardless of these efforts, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, any information you transmit to us is sent at your own risk.

#### safe shopping guarantee

The Fair Credit Billing Act states that your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent credit card charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any amount up to the full $50.00, Soludos will cover the entire liability, up to the full $50.00.

If you suspect unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card according to its reporting rules and procedures.

Please note that Soludos will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at Soludos online shopping while using our secure server.

#### children

We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that we have collected personally identifiable information from a user of the Site who is under the age of thirteen, we will remove that child’s personal information from our files.

#### optout/corrections

Upon your request, we will (a) correct or update your personal information; (b) stop sending emails to your email address; and/or (c) disable your account to prevent any future purchases through that account. You can make these requests by emailing your request to soludos.com Customer Support department at [info@soludos.com](mailto:info@soludos.com). Please clearly label the subject line "Opt Out / Corrections," and do not email your credit-card number or other sensitive information.

#### offline collection, use and disclosure of information

The majority of information that we collect is obtained through our Site, and this Privacy Policy applies only to that online collection of personal information. We also collect information offline, where we also try to protect the privacy of your personal information. One example involves someone calling us to place an order or to ask questions. When someone calls, we will ask only for the personal information we need in order to place the order or to answer the question. When we need to store information (such as order information), we will enter it into our database through SSL encryption. (See the Protecting Your Information section above for more information).

#### policy changes

We may change our Privacy Policy from time-to-time. We encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current Privacy Policy.  Once changes have been made to the Privacy Policy, your continued use of the Site will be considered your acknowledgement and acceptance of any such revisions to the Privacy Policy.

#### questions and feedback

We welcome your questions, comments and concerns about privacy. Please send us any and all feedback pertaining to privacy, or any other issue at info@soludos.com
