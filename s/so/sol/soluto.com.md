# Privacy Policy

## GENERAL INFORMATION

The Soluto.com Site (the "Site") is a website operated by Asurion, LLC ("Asurion"). Asurion respects the privacy of visitors who use the Site. This Privacy Policy describes how We treat Your use of the Site, Your access to Our Site, Software, services or the Soluto Mobile Application and the handling of Your personal information. Asurion reserves the right to revise or update this Privacy Policy at any time, and You agree to be bound by those revisions or updates. Asurion will notify You of any changes to the Privacy Policy by posting the revised or updated Privacy Policy and its Effective Date on the Site. Your use of the Site thereafter constitutes Your agreement to and acceptance of the Privacy Policy and its revisions or updates. You should periodically read the Privacy Policy to learn of any revisions or updates. If You do not agree to any terms of the Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. 

## INFORMATION COLLECTION

We collect both personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information through Your use of the Site, from Your access and use of the SMA and from Your downloading of Software from the Site. 

## NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION:

We gather certain broad, non-personally identifiable information ("Non-PII") about use of the Site, including the number of unique visitors to the Site, the frequency with which they visit the Site and the services preferred by those visitors on the Site. We look at the data regarding use of the Site in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. We gather this Non-PII data so We can learn, for example, which pages of the Site are the most and least viewed by visitors and which third-party websites are referring visitors to the Site. The Non-PII data helps Us determine the extent to which visitors use certain parts of the Site and allows Us to tailor the Site in the future. In connection with these activities, We may use the following standard technologies to collect information: 

  * **COOKIES:** A cookie is a small, removable data file that is stored by Your web browser on Your computer. We use cookies to, among other things, identify Your computer during a particular visit to the Site and analyze Your behavior during a particular visit. We do not store personal or sensitive information in cookies. Most Web browsers provide You with the ability to accept or decline cookies, as well as to be warned each time a cookie is being sent. If You choose to decline cookies, however, You may not be able to take advantage of all aspects of the Site. 
  * **PIXEL TAGS:** Pixel tags, also known as beacons or clear GIFs, help Us better manage content on the Site by informing it of what content is effective. Pixel tags are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on Web pages. 
  * **IP ADDRESSES:** We collect and analyze traffic on the Site by keeping track of the IP addresses of its visitors. An IP address is the unique numeric identifier assigned to each computer browser accessing the Internet. An IP address, by itself, cannot identify You personally. However, when combined with other information provided by Your Internet service provider, Your IP address can be used to identify the computer originating a message. 



## Remote Access/Quick Question/Chat

If You use Software or SMA remote access feature, then We will collect additional technical information such as session logs; connect/disconnect events; and other technical information regarding the remote access sessions. If You use the Quick Question feature, We will collect information about the support request, all correspondence and any screenshots You send. If You use the integrated chat feature of the Soluto service, We will collect technical information regarding the chat, such as events related to the initiation of the chat session and number of messages sent during the session. 

## USE OF INFORMATION

We may share both Your personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information with Our affiliates, subsidiaries, partners and other third parties, such as third parties who help operate the Site, the Services, the SMA and related databases.

For example, service providers may handle e-mail distribution, market research, information analysis and promotions management on Our behalf. We may also share PII and Non-PII in order to administer the Services, the SMA or the Site.
