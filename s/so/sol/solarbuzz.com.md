Solarbuzz respects your privacy and protects your personally identifiable information.  This statement outlines our privacy policy as it applies to our Solarbuzz.com website.

**Information Collected**

In our website, we give you the option of providing us with personal information in order to register for conferences, receive more detailed information on our products or services, respond to surveys or submit feedback on the website. The personal information we collect includes your name, the name of your company, your position, address, phone, fax, e-mail, and, to the extent applicable, credit card details. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from persons who are under the age of 18.

**How We Use This Information**

When you submit personal information on our web site, the information you submit is used only in connection with the purpose for which it is submitted and otherwise as may be permitted in this paragraph. We do not share your personal information with any third parties, except with our corporate affiliate (which itself would be subject to similar restrictions on use of your information as contained in this Privacy Policy) and, as may be applicable, agents or contractors of Solarbuzz who are required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for Solarbuzz. In addition, we may be required to disclose your personal information in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention, regulation, and other legal action or if we reasonably believe it is necessary to do so to protect Solarbuzz or our customers. In the event of the acquisition of Solarbuzz, or substantially all of its assets, the information we have collected from you will be among the acquired assets. Such information will remain subject to restrictions no less stringent than permitted under this Privacy Policy in effect at that time.

**Data Security; Internet Commerce**

Solarbuzz is committed to data security with respect to information collected on our site. We offer the industry standard security measures available through your browser called SSL encryption, to protect your information, including your credit card details.

**Online Experience**

Our server log, which records all transactions and the IP addresses that request them, is used to monitor traffic flow on our site in order to manage the site more effectively and to make sure its content is useful. Cookies may occasionally be used only to enhance your experience on our site and to make our site easier for you to navigate. In addition, the Solarbuzz Web server automatically recognizes some information about our visitors, including the company that provides their Internet service. Our server does not automatically recognize names, addresses, e-mail addresses or similar information specific to you as an individual.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. If there are material changes in how we may use your personal information, we will post a notice of such changes prior to implementation.

**Opt Out Policy**

Our e-mail communications with you will offer you the opportunity to unsubscribe from further Solarbuzz e-mail communications after your request is processed.

**Contact Solarbuzz**

If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or our web site, or wish to confirm, change or delete any of your personal information with us, email [contact@solarbuzz.com](mailto:contact@solarbuzz.com).
