Welcome to Soletron.com, which is owned and operated by Soletron, LLC. (“Soletron,” “We,” “Us,” or “Our”). We have created this Privacy Policy for the benefit of the users (“You” or “Your”) of Our Soletron.com website (the “Site”), and any mobile app and/or other online services We may provide (collectively, together with the Site, the “Services”) in order to demonstrate our serious commitment to protecting Your privacy. Our users may include merchants selling goods through Our Site (“Merchants”), shoppers, purchasers of merchandise, and all other visitors to Our Site and users of the Services, along with their authorized agents and third party service providers. The following information summarizes how Soletron collects, uses and discloses information on and through the Site, as well as any other information You provide to us over the Internet, including through any mobile applications. This Privacy Policy also applies to any offline contact that users of Our Services have with Us or Our office, such as over the telephone, but does NOT apply to information collected from our employees and contractors. Finally, this Privacy Policy applies to information about third-party individuals collected by Us from users of Our Site or any other Services. 

**What Information We Collect and How We Do It**

Information can generally be collected in two ways: (1) information that is knowingly and voluntarily input into Our system directly by You in response to particular prompts or fields, or that is otherwise knowingly and voluntarily provided by You (such as in an e-mail); and (2) information that is collected automatically when You use the Services. 

Some information can be “personally identifiable.” We use the term “personally identifiable” information to mean any type of information which could be utilized to identify or be readily associated with You. Examples of personally identifiable information we collect include, but are not limited to, Your name, postal address, telephone number, username and password, e-mail address, or any combination thereof. In order to operate Our Site and provide You with information on products and services that may be of interest to You, We collect personally identifiable information as well as demographic and activity information (e.g., zip code, hometown, gender, purchase history, brand preferences such as your favorite sneaker brands, and date of birth and/or age) from You. Demographic and activity information will be treated as personally identifiable information by Us if We associate it specifically with You. If you are a Merchant, we may also collect a sub-category of personally identifiable information that we call financial information. Financial information includes passwords, credit/debit card numbers, bank and other account numbers, and bank routing information. We require this information and keep it on file solely to process transactions and provide recourse to Soletron in the event of a Merchant loss (such as a dispute in which Soletron refunds money to a buyer). Please note that in some instances, We treat financial information differently from how We treat other types of personally identifiable information.

**Collection of Information You Provide Voluntarily**

Whenever You are prompted by the Site or Services to complete forms, provide payment information, and make choices, for example, and You choose to do so, You are voluntarily providing information to Us. This information may or may not be personally identifiable, depending upon what You are asked to provide. You may also choose to voluntarily submit information to Us when You communicate with Us by e-mail or telephone. For Your own security and protection, You should not send personally identifiable information through unencrypted e-mail, particularly information that You deem to be sensitive or confidential (such as financial information).

When You choose to access or connect to the Services through Facebook or another social networking website, certain information (“Social Network Information”) may be collected by Us. Social Network Information includes, but is not limited to, the login credentials for Your Facebook Connect, Twitter, StumbleUpon, Digg, or any other social networking or information-sharing website account, information You authorize that third party site to share with Us, and e-mail account information. Social Network Information may also include personally identifiable information about other individuals that Our users authorize and provide to Us. However, Soletron does not evade or circumvent personal privacy settings on Facebook or any other third party site. Please note that Soletron does not have any control over third party websites’ privacy practices, which are governed by their respective privacy policies. 

**Automatic Collection of Information**

Certain information is collected automatically from You when You interact with the Site or Services. This can be done through the use of software or other automated processes that Our Services use. However, Soletron does NOT use such automated processes to collect personally identifiable information such as Your name, contact information or financial information.

Our Site, like many websites on the Internet, uses “cookies.” A cookie is a small text file automatically placed on Your computer’s web browser that is used to recognize users who have previously visited the Site. In general, these cookies are either persistent and may reside on Your computer for several months or longer after You last accessed the Site (unless You delete or otherwise dispose of them), or they may be more temporary in nature. Our Site generally uses persistent cookies but may also use temporary cookies called “session cookies,” which are stored for a single user session on the Site and are deleted as soon as the user’s browser is shut down. 

We use cookies for purposes that include, but are not limited to, keeping track of Your purchases and other activities on the Site, delivering content specific to Your interests, saving Your password, and if You choose, saving other personal information so You do not have to re-enter it each time You visit the Site or otherwise use the Services. We do this to enhance Your experience with the Services and to make them as easy to use as possible. 

Third-party advertisers and advertising networks on the Site may also place their own cookies on Your browser and collect information directly from You in this manner, although they do not have access to cookies set by Us. These third party cookies are set to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to You that You might be interested in (both on our Site and other websites that You may visit in the future), to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to You. The use of these cookies and other automated technologies by such third parties to collect information are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. While We may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Site, You may wish to visit [_http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp_](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp) , which provides information regarding the “opt-out” procedures of certain third party ad servers We may use. We do not permit third parties (e.g., advertising networks) to use automated processes to collect personally identifiable information on the Site. 

If you do not wish to accept cookies, you can usually set your browser to decline them, and if You wish to delete or disable cookies previously placed on your computer, the “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell You how to do so. Please note, however, that if You choose to set Your browser to decline, delete or disable cookies, You may not be able to access certain areas of Our Site.

Like most websites, each time You visit the Site or other Services, We may automatically collect Your “internet protocol” (“IP”) address (and the website address that directed You to Us, when applicable), as well as other technical details concerning the equipment and software you are using to access the Services, including, for example, your operating system and browser software. An IP address is a unique series of numbers that identifies each computer connected to the Internet. An IP address can be used to provide information such as the date and time of a user’s visit, the availability of certain requested files, the popularity of various website functions, and the amount of information transmitted to each user from a site. Presently, We may use Your IP address to help identify You (in which case, if Your IP address is linked by Us with Your personally identifiable information, it will also be treated as personally identifiable information), to gather demographic information, to note the frequency of Your visits to this Site and the other Services, and to determine the frequency with which certain pages and functions of the Site and Services are accessed. This allows Us to improve the Site’s functionality and to diagnose problems. 

In addition to cookies, We or Our service providers may use web beacons, pixels and similar technologies on our Site and in e-mail messages or newsletters. These tiny electronic images can be used to assist Us in determining how many users have visited certain pages or opened messages or newsletters. However, We do NOT use these images to collect personally identifiable information. 

Finally, We may also use automated processes to collect statistical information about the behavior of visitors to the Site on an aggregated, anonymous basis, i.e., information that does not identify You as the subject or source of the information.

**How We Use Your Information**

Soletron uses Your information (whether personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable) solely for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. We require Our employees and service providers who may access Your personally identifiable information to respect Your privacy as set out in this Privacy Policy. 

Soletron uses Your information to:

  * process Your transaction requests and deliver the products and services that You have asked for;

  * provide customer support;

  * solicit feedback;

  * send You offers that You have opted in to receive;

  * perform research and analysis about Your use of, or interest in, Our products, services or content, or products, services or content offered by others; 

  * communicate with You about products or services that may be of interest to You either from Us or third parties (e.g. discounts, special merchandise, and exclusive deals); 

  * develop and display content and advertising (such as targeted ads) tailored to Your interests on Our Site and other websites; 

  * enforce Our Terms of Service; 

  * protect Soletron, Our Site and Services, Our customers and/or other users, and other third parties from fraud, hacking or other harm;

  * cooperate with legal, criminal or regulatory investigations or proceedings; 

  * provide You with newsletters, RSS feeds, or other communications or services which You have signed up for or otherwise agreed to receive; and

  * send account- or transaction-related communications such as welcome letters and transaction confirmations. 




We may also send You surveys and marketing communications to inform You of new products or services or other information or offers that may be of interest, and/or updates about Soletron or the Services. These surveys, marketing communications or updates may come from Soletron or from Our service providers. If You do not wish to continue to receive surveys, marketing communications or updates, You may indicate this preference by following the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” instructions included within each e-mail communication. Please keep in mind that, even if You choose not to receive these e-mail communications, You may continue to receive transactional or account communications (e.g., confirmation emails and notices of order changes and cancellations) and other communications which are required or permitted by applicable law. Also, opting-out or changing Your e-mail preferences on the Site will only affect future e-mail communications from Us or on Our behalf and will not affect e-mails from third parties who may have already received Your information. If you wish to stop receiving marketing e-mails from a third party, you will need to contact them directly.

**How We Share Your Information**

We only share your personally identifiable information with third parties as specifically described below. We also will NEVER make Your financial information available to Merchants or third-party marketers except in connection with a particular transaction or service you have specifically requested.

When You purchase merchandise or complete an order form on Our Site or otherwise through the Services, Your full name, contact information and other order details may be shared with the Merchant from whom you are buying the merchandise and their authorized third party service providers. We do this in order to process Your purchases and enable You to participate in discount programs which You have chosen. Such sharing of personally identifiable information with Merchants is a necessary part of providing You the services You have requested from Us when, for instance, You place an order for merchandise on Our Site. **By purchasing merchandise or completing an order form on the Site, you hereby consent to such sharing.** As You are a patron of the Merchant, and Soletron acts solely to facilitate sales transactions between You and Merchants, You should be aware that Merchants may use Your information in accordance with their own privacy policies; for example, they may use Your personally identifiable information to contact You or to market products or services to you, and may share Your personally identifiable information with others. Soletron has no control over such sharing and use of Your personally identifiable information. Accordingly, We strongly suggest that You review each Merchant’s privacy policy _**before**_ placing an order with them, and contact them directly to instruct them as to Your preferences for their sharing and use of Your personally identifiable information if you so desire.

_**Financial information collected from You by Merchants or their payment application providers is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and the Merchant and/or its payment application provider have exclusive responsibility for how such financial information is used and shared.**_

From time to time, where permitted by applicable law, We may share Your personally identifiable information (but not Your financial information) and automatically collected information about You with reputable direct marketers so that they may offer products and services which We hope will be of interest to You. Please see the section below entitled “Access to Your Personally Identifiable Information” for detailed information on Your choices regarding Your personally identifiable information. 

In addition, We may disclose Your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information to Our agents, contractors and service providers who are engaged to perform functions on Our behalf (such as processing transactions and payments, provision of data storage, hosting of Our website, marketing of Our products and services, conducting audits, and performing web analytics). These agents, third party contractors and service providers shall be permitted to obtain only the personally identifiable information they need to provide the specific service they have been charged with providing.

We may also disclose Your personally identifiable information to third parties when We believe, in good faith and in Our sole discretion, that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) enforce or apply Our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (b) comply with legal or regulatory requirements or cooperate with a law enforcement or regulatory investigation, (c) protect the rights, property or safety of Us, Our users or other third parties, (d) prevent a crime or protect national security, or (e) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. We may also disclose non-personally identifiable information to Our business partners, merchants, advertisers, investors, potential buyers and other third parties if We deem such disclosure, in Our sole discretion, to have sound business reasons or justifications. 

Certain information relating to usage of the Site and/or Our services may be shared with third parties (such as advertisers, marketing partners, service providers and others) on an aggregated, anonymous basis for research, analytical or promotional purposes (for example, so that they can customize their advertisements, promotions, and communications to the appropriate audience). However, such information will not identify You as the subject or source of the information. 

We may also share Your personally identifiable information if You grant Us permission to do so. 

Information about Our customers and users, including personally identifiable information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, or sale of Soletron and/or its assets, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which case personally identifiable information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. 

Finally, please also be aware that any third parties visiting the Site may see Your information You choose to enter into Your public profile or otherwise post on the Site (for more information, please see the section below entitled “Your Postings”). 

**Your Postings**

We may provide areas on Our Site where You can post information about Yourself, communicate with others, participate in forum discussions, post reviews or upload content (for example, profile pictures and other pictures of yourself that You choose to upload to Your public profile for other users to view). Whenever You disclose personally identifiable information publicly (such as on publicly viewable web pages), that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others, including for the sending of unsolicited messages. We can’t control who reads Your posting or what others may do with information You voluntarily post, so we encourage You to use Your discretion with respect to posting personally identifiable information. Also, such postings are governed by Our Terms of Service, so be sure to review them before posting.

**Our Security Precautions**

Soletron uses reputable third-party data centers and similar service providers to store Your personally identifiable information in password protected, encrypted databases. We and these service providers attempt to protect Your personally identifiable information by utilizing reasonable security measures to prevent loss, misuse, alteration, unintentional destruction or unauthorized access. For example, we use secure server software (SSL) to protect logins and purchase transactions. 

We also restrict access to Your personally identifiable information that is stored on our servers to only those Soletron employees, contractors, service providers and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve Our Site or Services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

However, no system can be completely secure. Although We and Our service providers take very significant steps to secure Your information, there is always a chance that Your information will not remain secure, and You should always take great care in handling and disclosing Your personally identifiable information. If You learn that Our security measures have been compromised or have other concerns, please inform Us immediately at _[privacy@soletron.com](mailto:privacy@soletron.com)_. 

**Access to Your Personally Identifiable Information**

When you use Our Site, we make good faith efforts to provide You with access to your personally identifiable information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at Your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes (such as retention for auditing purposes, to enforce our Terms of Service or to resolve disputes). Please e-mail us at _[privacy@soletron.com](mailto:privacy@soletron.com)_ with any change requests. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing all such requests, and We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backups), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case, where We provide information access and correction, We perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Please e-mail us at _[privacy@soletron.com](mailto:privacy@soletron.com)_ with any questions if You need assistance accessing or changing Your personally identifiable information, or if You would like to have Your personally identifiable information deleted. **** Please be aware that **** if You delete your personally identifiable information, You may not be able to continue to use the Site or Our Services. Please also be aware that, as discussed above, where Soletron has shared Your personally identifiable information with Merchants and third-party marketers, You will need to contact these third parties directly to access, change or delete personally identifiable information held by them. 

**International Users**

Soletron’s Services are provided from, and its servers are located in, the United States. The privacy and data security laws of the United States may be different from those in Your jurisdiction. By visiting our website and by providing Us with your Personal Information or data, you acknowledge and agree that due to the international dimension of Soletron, we may use the personally identifiable information or data collected in the course of our relationship for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy or in our other communications with you, including the transmission of information outside your resident jurisdiction. In addition, please understand that such information and data may be stored on servers located in the United States. By providing us with your personally identifiable information or other data, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Information and other data to the United States. 

**Children’s Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under 13 years of age. We do not authorize users less than 13 years of age to use the Site or Our other Services. If We learn that We have collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, upon receipt of notice from the child or a parent or guardian, We will delete that child’s information from our systems. 

**Your California Privacy Rights**

A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom she or he has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed her or his personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California Customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.

However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.

We will not share Your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes unless You affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically by opting in to receive information from a third party through our website. 

To prevent disclosure of Your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party for its own purposes, do not opt in to or authorize such use when You provide personal information through Our Services. Please note that whenever You choose to share Your personal information with a third party (such as when you use Our internal social networking features or share Your personal information via Facebook, Twitter or other social marketing service) or to allow Your personal information to be shared with a third party to communicate with You, Your information will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy. If You later decide that You do not want that third party to use Your information, You will need to contact the third party directly, as We have no control over how third parties use Your personal information and other information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects Your information to determine how that entity will handle Your information.

California Customers may request further information about Our compliance with California’s privacy law by e-mailing **privacy@soletron.com** or contacting us as stated below. Please note that We are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and We are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.

**Third Party Links**

The Services may contain links to websites owned and operated by third parties. Soletron’s Privacy Policy applies only to Our Services. We do not exercise privacy control over the sites which may be linked from or to the Soletron Site or other Services (including Merchant sites), and We have no responsibility for their privacy or data security practices. 

**Changes to This Policy**

Soletron may modify or update this Privacy Policy periodically with or without prior notice by posting the updated policy on this page. We encourage You to always check the “Last Updated” date at the top of this document to see when the Privacy Policy was last changed. We may also post a notice of changes to this Privacy Policy on the Site. We encourage you to check this Privacy Policy from time to time. Your continued use of Our Site and/or Services following the posting of an updated Privacy Policy constitutes Your consent to the contents of such policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO FUTURE CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST STOP USING OUR SITE AND SERVICES AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SUCH CHANGES.
