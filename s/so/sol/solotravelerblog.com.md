# Privacy Policy - Solo Traveler

The privacy of our readers is important to us and we recognize that privacy of your personal information is important to you too.

We never sell or share your personal information with third parties nor do we store any information about your visit to this blog other than to analyze and optimize your content and reading experience through the use of cookies.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

We do use cookies which, basically, tells the blog that you’ve been here before. This affects things like a message you’ll receive on your first three visits to the blog but only those first three visits.

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.

We also use third party advertisements to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

**Your Email Address**

If you sign up for our newsletter we require your email address but nothing more. We do not sell any information from our site to any outside party. The only e-mail you’ll receive from us is because you signed up for our double opt-in e-mail list. If anything comes to your attention which could potentially be a violation of this policy, please let us know immediately so that we can investigate it and try to correct it.

We are not responsible for republished content from this blog on other blogs or websites without our permission.
