**Privacy for E-SOAP Users**

Solium's privacy policy for E-SOAP users reflect the ten privacy protection principles that form the Canadian Standards Act (CSA), which has been entitled the Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information. The CSA deals with the rights of individuals to have access to their personal information and to have it corrected if necessary, as well as the ways in which an organization collects, uses and discloses personal information. 

The CSA was approved as a national standard by the Standards Council of Canada and was published in 1996. The Act incorporates the privacy provision of Canada's new Federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, revised in 2000. 

This policy supplements the Electronic Access Agreement and the Client Account Agreement(s) governing your account with Solium. 

Solium's Ten Privacy Protection Principles 

  1. **Accountability** \- All employees of Solium are required to follow the standards set out in this Privacy Policy, and are required to sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement as a condition of their employment. Only employees who have been authorized and have a legitimate business purpose can access confidential personal information.
  2. **Purpose of Collection Personal Information** \- The personal information we collect and use is limited to what is required to provide the entitlement plan administration services offered by Solium.
  3. **Consent** \- Consent for collection, use and disclosure of your personal information is obtained when an account is opened with Solium and you signify acceptance of Solium's Electronic Access Agreement and Client Account Agreement(s).
  4. **Limiting Collection** \- Personal Information collected is strictly limited to what is required to administer employee entitlement plans and the services provided within this administration. Information will be collected by means of your completion of an Activation Form, and information provided to us by your employer.
  5. **Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention** \- The use of personal information we collect is limited to what is required to provide the employee entitlement plan administration services as outlined by Solium, and shall not be used or disclosed for any other purpose. The collection of a Government issued identification number is only mandatory in instances where law requires it, such as for tax reporting purposes. All personal information collected is maintained in a highly secure environment and is kept strictly confidential and would only be disclosed to outside parties when authorized by you, when required by Law, or when permitted by Law. Your personal information is retained only as long as necessary for record keeping obligations for the administration of employee entitlement plans.
  6. **Accuracy** \- Solium makes every effort possible to maintain complete, accurate and up to date personal information by the collection of information provided by yourself and information provided by your employer. All personal information collected is available for you to view when you access your Solium account.
  7. **Safeguards** \- Solium has implemented strict procedures to protect the data stored within our infrastructure. Our data is housed at a secure offsite location with tight physical and electronic security access. All access and collection of personal information within our site requires a 128-bit encrypted browser, to ensure the highest commercial level of security for your Internet transactions. If you contact a Solium Client Account Administrator by phone, you will be asked to provide your personally selected verification word and/or some other personal identification information.
  8. **Openness** \- Our Privacy Policy is available to view on our site at any time or you may request information from us regarding our policies and practices that relates to the management of your personal information.
  9. **Client Access** \- All personal information is readily accessed through your personal account with Solium. You may access this information through our website or by contacting us directly. You may verify the accuracy and completeness of your information, and request amendments to this information if required.
  10. **Client Complaints and Suggestions** \- You may direct any inquiries regarding the above privacy principles or our practices by contacting us and speaking to the designated person(s) who is accountable for our Privacy and Practices at Solium.
