# Privacy Policy | SoGoSurvey

SoGoSurvey is an application service provider that provides you, our customer, tools to conduct two-way communications with your customers, employees, suppliers and constituents. Like the postal service, we understand that the Information we deliver belongs to you and your survey participants, not us. At SoGoSurvey, it is a core business principle that we must protect the privacy of our customers and survey participants or we will not have either. With this principle in mind, SoGoSurvey created this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy.

You should be assured that our practices stated in this policy are practiced worldwide. SoGoSurvey is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders. We may share information between SoGoSurvey entities and transfer it to offices around the world. Some countries may provide less legal protection for personal information than the country in which the information was provided. No matter the country standards, we will still handle the information in the manner we describe here.

This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on our web site at the URL [http://www.SoGoSurvey.com](http://www.sogosurvey.com/) (the "Site") SoGoSurvey service platform. It does not speak SoGoSurvey practices for information collected elsewhere or the practices of any third parties, including those of our partners who may display SoGoSurvey branding on their sites. The use of information collected through our service platform shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged SoGoSurvey.
