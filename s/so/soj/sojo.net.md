**How sojo.net uses cookies**   
Certain parts of our site require a free registration process to view premium content. This registration process requires cookies to be enabled in order to function properly and so that you don't need to re-register with future visits. If you're concerned about using cookies because you've been told they're a security risk, let us explain how we use them: 

  * We do not store any personally-identifiable information in cookies. 
  * Our Web site only reads the cookies it creates. 



Having no ability to read personal information on your hard drive, our cookies are just a method of noting that you've registered for our site in the past - so that you don't have to register each time you visit us. The information you submit at the time of registration is not stored in the cookie, but in our secure SojoMail subscription database. If you unsubscribe from SojoMail, that personal information is wiped out, but your cookie will still tell our site that you've registered - so even though you've unsubscribed from SojoMail, you won't have to re-register to view our premium Web content. Rest assured, cookies aren't a way for us to track your movements on the Web or spy on your hard drive, we're just trying to make your experience on our Web site more convenient. 

Most browsers have cookies enabled by default, but you may need to enable them manually. This process varies for different browsers. You may also have other security/utility software running which is blocking our use of cookies. Please see your software's documentation to determine how to enable cookies.
