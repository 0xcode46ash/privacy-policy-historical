Privacy Policy Statement

Last updated: July 12, 2012

This site is owned and operated by SoftChalk LLC, ("SoftChalk" or "We"). This statement governs information you provide to us or we learn from your use of this Web site and tells you how we may collect, use, and in some instances disclose this information.

Information SoftChalk Collects

SoftChalk gathers two types of information about this Web site's users:

  * Except as set out in this privacy policy, we will not disclose your personal information without your consent unless we are legally required or entitled to do so. Personal information may be collected directly from you or from third parties. This information may be collected in person, over the telephone, through the mail, or over the internet. When SoftChalk collects personal information from you, we will explain how we intend to use it, will collect only what we believe is reasonably necessary to meet those purposes, and will not use or disclose it for other unrelated purposes without your consent, unless legally required or entitled to do so. As an example, SoftChalk may collect personal information (i) when you register to receive personalized information on its Web site or from SoftChalk Customer Service; (ii) to gain entry into one of SoftChalk's secure sites; and (iii) to enter one of SoftChalk's promotions. 
  * SoftChalk may share your personal information with third parties, such as channel partners, service providers or other organizations (i) where the third party or SoftChalk has your consent; (ii) where legally required or entitled to do so; (iii) where the third party is acting as our agent, contractor or service provider and has agreed to handle your personal information in confidence and in accordance with applicable laws; and (iv) where business mergers, divestments or acquisitions are involved. For example, when you register for certain sales promotions, SoftChalk may share your personal information with a SoftChalk channel partner that it feels can help meet your needs. 
  * SoftChalk also gathers non-personal information through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This non-personal information collected includes click-throughs, IP addresses, and usage data. This non-personal information allows us to better tailor our content to site users' needs.
