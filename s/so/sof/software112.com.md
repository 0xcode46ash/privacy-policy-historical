If you choose to receive information from us, each message will also include instructions on how to "unsubscribe" from future newsletters, if you wish to cancel. The only information we automatically collect is that related to the use of our web site. This information is anonymous and is gathered through our servers log files. These log files record generic information, such as the number of visits our web site receives, the types of browsers used and the number of files downloaded, but never personal information. This log file information allows us to create better content aimed at our viewer�s preferences.
