Softland SRL ("SOFTLAND") is dedicated to making your online experience as interesting and enjoyable as possible. We truly appreciate your presence on our sites and at all times understand that you are our guest and should be treated accordingly. To ensure this, we have listed the components of our Privacy Policy below.  
  
## Use of Personal Information  
  
Any information you submit to SOFTLAND (through the website or by e-mail) will be held in the strictest confidence. In no way will your personal information ever be used without your consent. To ensure this, all forms on our web sites that send information to a database that will be used in the future (e.g. the newsletter list) have opt-in options, meaning you receive a confirmation email where you click a generated link specifying that you would like to receive information from us in the future. If you do not confirm your subscription we will not add you to our database. Be assured that we do not sell our name and address lists. If you choose to receive information from us, each message will also include instructions on how to "unsubscribe" from future newsletters, if you wish to cancel. The only information we automatically collect is that related to the use of our web site. This information is anonymous and is gathered through our servers log files. These log files record generic information, such as the number of visits our web site receives, the types of browsers used and the number of files downloaded, but never personal information. This log file information allows us to create better content aimed at our viewer�s preferences.   
  
## Use of Cookies  
  
Some of our pages use a feature of your browser called a "cookie." A cookie is a small file stored on the user's computer containing information about the computer. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our sites. Some of our partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. Please refer to the privacy policies of the network for details.  
  
## Use of Links  
  
Software112.com contains links to external websites. SOFTLAND is not responsible for the privacy practices of such external websites. We encourage our users to read the privacy policies of every external website that is linked from our site. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by Software112.com  
  
## Changes to this policy   
  
SOFTLAND reserves the right to modify its Privacy Policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes to be minor. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page.
