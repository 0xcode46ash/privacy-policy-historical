# About Imark

**Imark Privacy Statement**

As a leading technology events company, Imark is committed to the internet as a powerful means of communication, research and doing business. And Imark is committed to your privacy. To protect your privacy while allowing you to utilize all that Imark has to offer, we have developed and follow certain principles for audience and user privacy and data protection.

Imark collects personal information about our users during registration for our events, use of our site services, from order forms for our publications/newsletters, upon user entry into an Imark's content, and through our "cookie" technology as you use and navigate our sites.

If you choose not to provide personal information, you can still use most of our site(s). However, you will not be able to access areas that require registration.

We aggregate the data we collect to create a demographic picture of the Imark audiences in order to improve site services. We also share the aggregated information, but not individual data, with our sponsors and advertisers to help them better understand our services and monitor their advertising reach on the sites.

Personal information, such as your name and address, is used to service your account and to inform you about updates to our products and services.  We may also use this information to notify you of new products and services from Imark, its affiliates, and third parties that we believe may be of interest to you.

Since Imark respects your right to privacy, when you register for events, online services and email newsletters, you have the option to decline mailings about additional products and services from Imark or other parties to whom Imark may provide such information. When you subscribe to our print publications, you can elect to not receive third-party mailings  by contacting our customer service using the contact information below.

Imark carefully protects the security of your personal information, and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We will disclose such information only to third parties we believe to be responsible. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of third parties who receive this information. Imark also links to many other sites, but we are not responsible for their privacy policies or practices.

If for any reason you believe Imark has not met its privacy commitments to you, we ask that you notify us by e-mail at [events@imark-com.com](mailto:events@imark-com.com), and we will  quickly address the problem.

At any time, you may correct your personal information and/or opt not to receive additional mailings by contacting Imark Customer Service by e-mail at [events@imark-com.com](mailto:events@imark-com.com) or by telephone at 888.827.6699, or by mail at Imark Communications, Customer Service Department, One Apple Hill Drive, Suite 301, Natick, MA 01760.
