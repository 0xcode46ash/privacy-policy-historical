# Privacy Policy

At SoftPerfect, your security and privacy is of the utmost importance to us. This policy describes how we collect, use and protect your personal information.

## Contact information

We collect basic contact information that you provide when you contact us. This information is used for administrative purposes only, and is not shared with our partners or third parties.

## General information

We also collect general, non-personal information about visitors to our website. This information is collected for creating a broad picture of our visitors and is not focused on any one individual. It is used to continually refine our products and services.

## Purchases

When you purchase a product from us, both your personal data and payment details, including credit card number where applicable, are encrypted as they traverse the Internet.

We do not keep or record your credit card number. It is passed directly to the secure payment gateway for processing the purchase. Your other details are kept in a secure database for administrative purposes, so that we can help you recover your licence key if you lose it, or provide technical support.

## E-mails and marketing

We never send any unsolicited or marketing e-mails. Only occasionally, once a year or so, we may e-mail you about the product you purchased.
