The SoftPerfect.com Privacy Policy  
  
At SoftPerfect Research, your security and privacy is of the utmost importance to us. We take the following steps to protect your personal information:  
  
Information  
  
SoftPerfect Research collects basic contact information when you subscribe to newsletter or fill in a contact form. This information will be used for administrative and identification purposes only and will not be shared with our partners or third parties.  
General information  
  
SoftPerfect Research also collects general demographic information about visitors to our site. The information we collect creates a broad picture of our population rather than focusing on any one individual. This information is used to continually refine our products and to identify the most popular areas of our site.  
Encrypted credit card purchases  
  
If you use a credit card to purchase a SoftPerfect Research product, the credit card number is encrypted as it passes over the Internet. Your credit card number is not kept or recorded by SoftPerfect Research or our computers - it is simply passed through to the credit card company to purchase the product(s). In this respect, buying a product from SoftPerfect Research is similar to a credit card purchase at any store. Neither SoftPerfect Research nor the store keeps your credit card number on file.
