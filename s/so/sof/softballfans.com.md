Because Softball Fans, Inc. takes your privacy very seriously, our state-of-the-art site employs the very best security measures available to protect you. Our primary means of protection is FULL HTTPS/SSL SUPPORT, which encrypts all your personal information, including your credit card data, and prevents it from being intercepted over the Internet. We will never share or sell your personal information, including your email address, to other companies for any reason, except as required by law. Several sections of our site offer links to other sites.

You always have the option of entering your credit card information on our site or calling us to provide it over the phone. 

**SSL Technology**

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology is presently the safest way to send credit card information over the Internet. Information is first encrypted on your computer, then decrypted on our side, preventing anyone from accessing any information in between. To ensure your security, we recommend the use of SSL-capable browsers, like Netscape 3.0 or Internet Explorer 3.0 or higher.
