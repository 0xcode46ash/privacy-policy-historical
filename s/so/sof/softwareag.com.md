Our websites also reference and include links to third-party websites. As a rule, these are identified by stating the respective third-party Internet address or the company/product logo. Software AG has no influence whatsoever on the contents and design of websites of other providers. By referencing/linking these external websites we do not adopt their contents as our own.

 **2.  Cookies**

Information about our usage of cookies, especially for marketing purposes, can be found in our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/corporate/privacy_cookies.asp "Privacy Policy - Cookie").

 **3\. Purposes of the Data Processing**

Moreover, the information provided to us may be combined with data on you that has already been stored by us. Such data combination allows us to keep the data collected by us updated, in order to provide for the accuracy of the collected information and to optimize our service to you.

Beyond these purposes, we use and process your data only if you have expressly granted your prior consent thereto and if you have been informed about such purposes. Thus, for example, you may stipulate in an online job application whether we may also review such application with respect to other positions in our company. Only if this is the case, we will use such data for the respective purpose.

These service providers may be located outside the European Union or the European Economic Area which means that the level of protection in respect to data protection law might differ from the level of protection provided by European data protection legislation.

Software AG is a globally operating corporation. In order to better process your matter, it might be necessary to forward your data to local subsidiaries or to local distribution partners, whose registered office might also be located in countries outside the European Union. However, such transmission takes place only within Software AG group companies and only for the aforementioned purposes.

Beyond that, we do not forward your data to other third parties, unless we are obliged to do so by virtue of statutory provisions or order of any judicial or other public authorities.
