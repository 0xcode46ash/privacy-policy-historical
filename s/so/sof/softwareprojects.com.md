Please read the complete SoftwareProjects.com privacy policy for suppliers and affiliates (the “Privacy Policy”). 

**Collection of your Personal Information**

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you. Personal information collected by SoftwareProjects.com is often limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested. 

We also collect certain information about your computer hardware and software. This information may include: your IP address, browser type, operating system, domain name, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service and the Website, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Website. 

We also collect information about which pages our customers visit within the Website. This Website visitation data is identified only by a unique ID number, and it is never linked with personal information unless a user consents as described below. 

**Use of Cookies**

When someone visits the site, a cookie is placed on the customer's machine (if the customer accepts cookies) or is read if the customer has visited the site previously. One use of cookies is to assist in the collection of the site visitation statistics described above. 

We also use cookies to collect information on which newsletter links are clicked by customers. This information is used to ensure we are sending information customers want to read. It is collected in aggregate form and never linked with your personal information. 

Web beacons, also known as clear gif technology, or action tags, may be used to assist in delivering the cookie on our site. This technology tells us how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a SoftwareProjects.com Web page. We do not use this technology to access your personally identifiable information on SoftwareProjects.com; it is a tool we use to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage. We may share aggregated site statistics with partner companies but do not allow other companies to place clear gifs on our sites. 

If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from the Website, you will be able to view the text on the screens, however you will not experience a personalized visit nor will you be able to subscribe to the service offerings on the site. 

**Use of your Personal Information**

We use your personal information for the following purposes: 

  * * To ensure our site is relevant to your needs.

  * * To help us create and publish content most relevant to you.
  * * To allow you access to limited-entry areas of our site as appropriate.



We may use third parties to assist us in providing our services, and we may provide personal information to these third parties. However, we will only share personal information with third parties if they agree to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and to use this information only in connection with providing services to us and assisting us in providing our services. These other entities may use and disclose information as provided in this Privacy Policy. 

We may use your information to gather and provide aggregated or statistical information that is not personally attributable to you. For example, we may aggregate certain information regarding use of the services so that your usage of the services is not discernable from the aggregate usage of our services. We may use and share with third parties any information that we derive from personal information but that is not personally identifiable to you. 

We may obtain your consent to disclose your personal information to a third party, in which case we will limit our disclosure and the use of your personal information only to the purposes for which we obtain your consent. If we disclose your personal information to a third party with your consent, then this information will become subject to the privacy policy or other privacy commitments, if any, of that third party. 

We may disclose your personal information to legal or government regulatory authorities in response to compulsory process or other requests for such information or to assist in investigations of theft, fraud, abuse or other alleged unlawful conduct. We may also disclose your personal information to third parties in connection with claims, disputes or litigation, when otherwise required by law, or if we determine, in our sole discretion, that disclosure is necessary in an emergency. 

Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which SoftwareProjects or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this Website, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. 

**Our Communications**

SoftwareProjects.com may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service or security issues related to a product or service you requested, or confirming an order or your request for a product or service. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are an essential part of the service you have chosen. You will have the option to unsubscribe (opt-out) of all marketing communications from us by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of every email message we send or replying to the message with the word unsubscribe in the message body.

**Security of your Personal Information**

SoftwareProjects.com is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide in computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit sensitive information (such as a credit card number) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

**Retention of Personal Information**

We will retain your personal information for so long as necessary to meet our business needs and to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Your personal information is primarily stored in digital media, and when we no longer need to retain your personal information we will dispose of your personal information, whether stored in digital media or in hard copies, in a secure manner.
