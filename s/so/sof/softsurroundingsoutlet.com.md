Our Customer Service can be reached via e-mail at [socustserv@kwcorp.com](mailto:socustserv@kwcorp.com). Or you can reach us by telephone at 888-414-7638 (toll free). 

For each visitor to our web site, our web server automatically recognizes the visitor's domain name / IP address, but NOT their email address or any other personal information. 

We use domain name / IP address information only to generate statistics and reports about site traffic and browsing patterns. It is not possible for us to gather personal information from domain name / IP address information. 

We do have forms on our site where visitors may be asked to provide personal information, including their name, address, phone # and email address. In many cases much of the information is voluntary and need not be submitted by the visitor. The information being collected varies depending on the nature of the visitor's request. 

If a visitor does wish to submit personal information, the information we collect is used to service the visitor's request (for example, to send one of our print catalogs). In addition, we may use the collected information to improve the content of our web site, share it with other reputable organizations to help them contact consumers for marketing purposes, and use it internally to contact consumers for marketing purposes.
