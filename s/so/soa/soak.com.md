**We take your privacy seriously...**

     This notice is to inform you about the policies for collection and use of personally identifiable information at SOAK. Sites which are linked to our site, email newsletters, RSS feed, and other services may have different policies; please review the privacy policy notices on those sites for details.

     The owner/operator of SOAK is Information Outfitters, Inc. PO BOX 159, Eastwood, KY 40018.

     We do not collect personally identifiable information about you on this site without your knowledge, and all such information is collected directly from you.

     We try to keep the information we collect from you as current as possible, and we take steps to maintain the security of your personal information and to prevent unauthorized access to it by those who do not have a legitimate need for it.

     We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * When we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.  
 

  * When we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.  
 

  * In the event that we sell our company, merge with another company, or sell the SOAK business asset to another company, we will transfer any personal information we have collected as part of the transaction.




     Whenever you provide your email address to SOAK, for example, by signing up for an email newsletter or entering a contest, you grant us the right to send you occasional emails promoting services and products offered by Information Outfitters, its affiliates, partners, and advertisers.

     If we learn that you are under 13 years of age, we will not maintain or use any personally identifiable information about you without the verifiable consent of your parent or guardian, except as allowed by law. This may mean that you will be unable to participate in some activities on the site without that verifiable consent.
