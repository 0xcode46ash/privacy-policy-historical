# Sony Electronics Inc. Privacy Policy

  |  Online Privacy Policy   
Sony Electronics Inc.

At Sony Electronics Inc. we believe our online visitors have a right to know what information we collect when you visit our Websites. The guidelines contained here apply only to your visit to the Websites for our U.S. electronics operations. If you have any questions about our practices, you can contact us at: 

[custserv@info.sel.sony.com](mailto:custserv@info.sel.sony.com) What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It? 

For each visitor to a Sony Electronics Inc. Website, our Web server automatically recognizes and stores the visitor’s IP address/Domain name combination. Your computer provides this information automatically each time you log on, unless you’ve activated blocking technology available in some browsers. We also may combine your IP Address/Domain name combination with other information you provide us like your e-mail address. You provide this information when, for example, you post messages to our bulletin boards, send us an e-mail, submit postings to our chat areas, fill out a registration, answer a survey, complete a fulfillment order or sign up for a site newsletter. We may also use a technology called "cookies" to record your activity while you are online. This technology allows us to do things like remember the items you want to purchase as you shop. We provide these as examples of our practices and encourage you to decide whether you want us to have this information. Data collected during your visit to a Sony Electronics Inc. Website is used for internal review and may be used to improve or customize the Website content or layout and/or notify consumers about updates to our Websites. The information may be shared with other Sony organizations and/or third parties if we think it appropriate to do so, e.g., for marketing purposes.   

Opt Out. 

Some of the pages contained within the Sony Electronics Inc. Websites allow you to opt out of Sony’s use or sharing of your information (e.g., for future marketing campaigns conducted by Sony or third parties). If opting-out is offered, these sites will prompt you to select your preference when entering personally identifiable information. When you opt out, you do so only for that particular submission. Because Sony and others may already have your personal information on file through other means like product registration, you may receive materials from other sources. If you have any questions about materials you receive, you can send an e-mail to the above address. As we upgrade our Website technology, we are committed to providing you with the opportunity to access and modify your record and select personal preferences. 

Your Consent. 

By submitting your information to us, you are consenting to the uses we describe above. If you do not consent to these uses, we suggest you opt out where available, activate blocking technology if available in your browser, or choose not to submit your data. This is a Website of Sony Electronics Inc.
