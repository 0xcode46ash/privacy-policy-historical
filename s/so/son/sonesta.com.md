At Sonesta International Hotels Corporation (Sonesta), we are committed to protecting your privacy and safeguarding your personally identifiable information, sometimes referred to as “PII”. We have provided this Privacy Policy as an explanation of the information we collect, how we use it, how the use of this information can benefit your experience on our web sites and during your relationship with us, with whom and for what purposes we may share the information, and the choices you can make about our use of the information.

As one of our guests or visitors to our websites, you understand and agree that we collect, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Information We Collect and Purpose for Collection**  
Sonesta collects information about our guests and visitors to our web sites so that we can provide an experience that is responsive to your needs.

You can always browse our websites without revealing who you are or providing personal information. When you visit our websites, we collect information to analyze the usage of the websites in order to improve the user experience on the sites. In some instances, we use cookies and/or collect IP (Internet Protocol) addresses to determine trends, frequency of visits, pages most visited, etc. The cookies and IP address do not personally identify you and we do not use them to link your personal information such as name, address, etc.

Information may be collected as part of responding to a survey, subscribing to our newsletters, making and fulfilling a reservation, registering for our loyalty program, accommodating your personal preferences, updating your contact information, working with third parties, and purchasing products or services. The types of personally identifiable information that we collect may include your name, home, work and e-mail addresses, telephone, mobile telephone, credit card information, gender, and lifestyle information such as room preferences and other information necessary to fulfill special requests (e.g., health conditions that require special room accommodations).  
Sonesta may also collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your use of our web sites, communication preferences, travel habits and aggregated data relative to your stays.  
Please do not include any credit card information in your electronic communication with us unless it is specifically required by us as part of the reservation or transaction fulfillment process on our branded reservation web sites, or our customer contact centers.

**Information Processing and Disclosure**  
In most cases, the information you provide is added to a local or global database. In the course of processing your information, it may be necessary to transfer your personal information to Sonesta's affiliates, properties within the Sonesta system and/or third party service providers located in the United States and throughout the world for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Unless otherwise precluded or governed by legal requirements, Sonesta subsidiaries, affiliates, property owners, and our third party service providers that may receive your information are required to abide by substantially similar privacy requirements relating to your personal information. As a general practice, Sonesta does not sell, rent, or give physical possession of your personal information to other parties. Situations in which Sonesta may disclose your information to others include: 

  * when we have received your consent to do so,
  * when a hotel or other property leaves the Sonesta system and access to your PII is necessary to facilitate business operations or meet contractual obligations,
  * to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance with applicable law, a court order or a subpoena, or
  * in case of emergency in order to safeguard the life, health, or property of an individual.



If information is shared as mentioned above, we seek to limit the scope of information that is furnished to the amount necessary for the performance of the specific function.

**Security**  
Because the security of your personal information is important to us, we use Secured Socket Layer (“SSL”) software in order to encrypt the personal information that you provide to us. If your browser is SSL enabled (which most are), your transmission of personal information to us online will be encrypted. You can verify whether your personal information is transmitted using SSL encryption by confirming the symbol of a closed lock or solid key in your browser window. You can also verify that your personal information will be encrypted using SSL encryption by making sure that the prefix for the web address listed for that page has changed from “http” to “https”. If you do not see the appropriate symbol and the “https” prefix, you should not assume that the personal information that you are being asked to provide will be encrypted prior to transmission.

The personal information we collect from you online is stored by us and/or our service providers on protected databases. Nevertheless, security measures cannot prevent all loss, misuse or alteration of personal information and we are not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such incidents.

**Links to Other Websites**  
In some cases, our websites contain links to websites operated and maintained by third parties over which we have no control. When you connect to such website, you leave our website. You should always read the privacy policy on these sites prior to transmitting any personal data since we cannot verify or be responsible for information not maintained by Sonesta International Hotels Corporation. You connect to these sites at your own risk.

**Protecting Minor Children**  
Sonesta websites do not sell products or services for purchase by children. If you are under the age of 13 (or a minor in the jurisdiction in which you are accessing our websites), you may only use our websites with the supervision of a parent or guardian.

**Opt Out**  
Our intention is that you should only receive email communications that you request, or that you will find useful.  We may periodically contact you via email to provide information on upcoming or past reservations, Travel Pass account information, general hotel or corporate informational updates, or to ask for your feedback on our service.  We may also send promotional emails with special offers that may be of interest to you (unless you have opted out). All of our promotional emails give you the option to opt out at any time by clicking on a link at the bottom of the email.  You may also opt out of any future promotional emails by emailing your request to: [EMAILOPTOUT@SONESTA.COM](mailto:EMAILOPTOUT@SONESTA.COM). Please allow 10 business days for your email opt out request to take effect.

You may choose not to submit your PII by submitting your request [HERE](http://www.sonesta.com/Corporate/index.cfm?fa=corporate.compliance). However, doing so may cause certain transactions to become affected. For example, not providing a name will prevent the processing of reservations.
