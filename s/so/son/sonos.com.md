Information we collect

Sonos only obtains personal information that a visitor to Sonos.com voluntarily and knowingly provides. This means that you can visit our website without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. To measure the performance of and continually improve our website, we do, however, collect some generic information about our visitors. This information may include: your IP address, browser type, operating system, domain name, access times and referring Web site addresses. We aggregate this information and use it for the operation of the website, to improve quality and performance of the website and to provide general statistics regarding use of Sonos.com. See also Cookies and Tracking Technology.

Sonos may collect personally identifiable information through this website and is the sole owner of such information. Personal information includes any information that may be used to identify you, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, birth date, gender, occupation, demographic data, industry, personal interests and potentially other information when needed to provide a product or service you request. You may choose to provide personal information to Sonos in a variety of ways through our website, including:

  * Registering to receive news or information about our products;
  * Placing an order for a product; 
  * Registering a Sonos product that you have purchased;
  * Sending us e-mail; 
  * Submitting a support request;
  * Registering as a Digital Expert.



In each of the instances above, we may ask for some or all of the personal information described above. When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of collection the purpose(s) for which it is to be used. If we ever ask for significantly different information we will inform you. In addition, we will clearly identify personal information that is required versus optional information.

Information Use, Sharing and Disclosure

When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific purpose, Sonos uses the information for that purpose (such as to provide the information the visitor has requested or to consider a visitor for a particular job). When visitors use our website to order products, or to request information about them, we may use the individual information as we would use the same information obtained off-line - for example, to evaluate your needs and contact you regarding additional products, information or services that we believe you may find useful. You have the right to choose not to receive this information by notifying us of your preference.

We do not sell individual information obtained on-line about our visitors. And, we will not disclose the personal information you provide to us via the website to parties unaffiliated with Sonos unless you specifically authorize it, we believe it is reasonably required by law or we believe that disclosure is reasonably required to protect the safety of customers, employees or property.

Sonos uses a variety of third party contractors to perform services such as website management and hosting, online product purchases and shipping, credit card processing and email marketing. In such instances, your personal information may be shared with these agents or contractors but only for the purpose of performing services on behalf of Sonos and in accordance with this privacy policy. In addition, if Sonos gets acquired by another company, your personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred to the successor company.

We will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing or market research information. This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this policy unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you do not consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at the point of collection. In some cases, when applicable, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in." This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted.

Security

Sonos uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide in computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit sensitive information (such as a credit card number) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. If at any time you would like to make a purchase, but do not want to provide your credit card information online, you may contact a Sonos sales representative over the telephone. We require our employees to protect the privacy of information about our customers and expect our partners and suppliers to do so as well. 

Cookies and Tracking Technology

A cookie is a small data file that some Web sites write to your computer hard drive when you visit the site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once a visitor closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Some parts of Sonos' website use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. In addition, we use cookies as necessary to perform functions specific to a visitor, such as purchasing a Sonos product or submitting a support request.

If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you that a cookie is present. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you will not be able to take full advantage of Sonos' website if you do so. In particular, you will be required to accept cookies in order to complete certain actions on our website, such as ordering a product or submitting a support request.

Email

Sonos does not send unsolicited "junk" email (spam). We may use email to communicate with our visitors, to respond to visitors' emails, to confirm orders placed online, and to send information that a visitor has requested. If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can reply to the email to ask not to receive future emails. Sonos provides an unsubscribe function in its email campaigns in order for subscribers to opt out of further email communications from us.

Children and Privacy

The Sonos website does not target and is not intended to attract children. Sonos does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information.

Third Party Sites

Sonos' website may contain links to other websites that are operated by third parties. Sonos does not share your personal information with those websites, nor are we responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.

Updating your information

If you have previously provided us with personal information, you may access, correct, and update information by visiting our site and utilizing our support application. The Support area of the site contains links (My Stuff) by which users can send in informational updates and corrections.

Notice of changes to this policy

Sonos will update this privacy policy statement from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "last updated" date at the bottom of this page. For changes to the privacy statement that we deem to be material, we will notify you by placing a prominent notice on home page of the Sonos.com site.
