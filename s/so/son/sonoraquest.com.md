About Sonora Quest Laboratories’ Privacy Policy
Sonora Quest Laboratories and its employees must obtain, maintain, use and disclose
patient protected health information (PHI) in a manner that protects patient privacy and
complies with all state and federal laws. We may only use or disclose the minimum
amount of PHI necessary to perform a job or complete an activity.
Sonora Quest Laboratories is required by law to provide patients with this Notice of
Privacy Practices with respect to PHI, to maintain the privacy of PHI, to state the uses
and disclosures of PHI that Sonora Quest Laboratories may make, and to list the rights
of individuals and our legal duties with respect to their PHI. Your PHI at Sonora Quest
Laboratories includes medical information we obtain from your physician (such as
name, address, date of birth, test ordered, etc.), health plan, or other sources, and the
laboratory testing results that we create. An example of PHI is as follows: Jane Smith,
Date of Birth: 2/15/68, resides at 123 Main Street, Anytown, AZ, cholesterol of 215
ng/ml.
Sonora Quest Laboratories is required to abide by the terms of the Notice of Privacy
Practices currently in effect and reserves the right to apply any changes to its policies
and procedures to PHI created or received prior to the effective date of the Notice
revision. The current Notice will be displayed on our website.


How we obtain and maintain your Protected Health Information
We obtain PHI from payers and, through the processing of testing orders, from
physicians or other authorized persons who order laboratory tests. As a result of our
testing activities, we create PHI -- laboratory results. We are required by law to
maintain the PHI we collect and create for various reasons, including regulatory
requirements, medical documentation, and laboratory certification and accreditation
purposes. Whether your PHI is stored on paper, on a computer, or using other means,
we will take reasonable care to maintain this information in a manner that will protect
your privacy and confidentiality and the privacy and security of your PHI.
How we protect the privacy of your Protected Health Information
We protect the privacy of your PHI by training our employees and by requiring them to
comply with company policies and procedures that allow access to and uses and
disclosures of your PHI only for legitimate reasons. We verify the identity and check the
authority of persons requesting PHI. We check that the appropriate information is
provided to the requestor through a verification procedure, that is, by matching the
information that the requestor must provide to us in advance with the information in our
records. If the requestor cannot provide adequate information or the information
provided does not match our records, we will not release your PHI. If the requestor is
the patient, we will refer the requestor to his or her physician (or authorized person) to
obtain the PHI. Sonora Quest Laboratories’ employees must comply with detailed
policies and procedures regarding access to, and uses and disclosures of patients’ PHI.
Sonora Quest Laboratories employees are required to use and disclose only the
minimum amount of PHI needed for payment or other legitimate uses for our health care
operations. Violation of these company policies or procedures is grounds for
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
How we use and disclose your Protected Health Information
Your PHI will only be used or disclosed for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations
purposes and other disclosures permitted or required by law, unless you send us written
authorization permitting us to use or disclose your PHI for other purposes. You have
the right to revoke your authorization at any time.
For Treatment: Sonora Quest Laboratories may use your PHI or disclose your PHI to
physicians and other authorized health care professionals who may need access to
your PHI in order to treat you effectively. For example, in addition to your treating
physician, we may provide a specialist consulting physician with information about your
results to further validate the results before release to your physician.
For Payment: We may use your PHI or disclose your PHI to insurance companies,
hospitals, physicians, health plans, or third parties to assist us in creating bills or claim
forms for getting paid for our services. For example, we may send your name, date of
service, test performed, diagnosis code, and other information to a health plan so that
the plan will pay us for the services we provided.
For Healthcare Operations: We may use or disclose your PHI in the course of
activities necessary to support our health care operations, such as performing quality


checks on our testing, for teaching purposes, or for developing normal reference ranges
for tests that we perform.
Disclosures to Business Associates: Sonora Quest Laboratories may disclose your
PHI to other companies or individuals who need your PHI in order to provide specific
services to us. These other entities, known as “business associates,” must comply with
strict contractual standards designed to ensure that they will maintain the privacy and
security of the PHI we provide to them or which they create on our behalf. Our
business associates must only use your PHI for designated treatment, payment, or
health care operations purposes that we contract them to perform on our behalf. For
example, we may disclose your PHI to the College of American Pathologists and other
private accrediting organizations that inspect and certify the quality of our laboratories.
As Permitted or Required by Law: We may release your PHI for various public policy
reasons that are authorized or required by law.
Public Health: We may disclose your PHI when reporting communicable disease
results to public health departments as required by law.
Health Oversight: We may disclose your PHI in connection with governmental
oversight, licensure, auditing, and other purposes. For example, governmental
agencies periodically review our records to ensure that Sonora Quest Laboratories is
complying with the rules of various regulatory and licensing agencies. The U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services and state Health Departments are examples
of agencies that oversee aspects of Sonora Quest Laboratories’ operations.
Government agencies, such as OSHA or the FDA may require us to provide PHI in
connection with an investigation or other proceeding.
Law Enforcement: We may also disclose PHI for law enforcement purposes. For
example, we may be required to release PHI to identify or locate a suspect, fugitive,
material witness, or missing person.
Public Safety: When the appropriate conditions apply, we may use or disclose PHI to
prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or
the public.
Specialized Government Functions: We may disclose your PHI for military, national
security, prisoner and government benefits (for health plans only) purposes.
Other: Here are other situations where, typically, the law permits or requires us to
disclose your PHI:
    • Various state and federal laws permit or require disclosure of PHI. For example,
        workers compensation programs may require that we provide the results of
        laboratory testing as part of the case file.
    • Subpoenas, court orders, discovery requests or other legal process may require
        the disclosure of PHI in the context of a lawsuit or other legal proceeding.
    • In cases where state law is more restrictive than federal law, we are required to
        follow the more restrictive state law; for example, in the state of Arizona, we are
        not permitted to release laboratory test results directly to a patient.
We may contact you for specific reasons
Sometimes, we may want to contact you regarding health-related products or services
that may be of interest to you, such as to direct or recommend alternative treatments,
therapies, health care providers, or settings of care or to tell you about other health-
related products or services offered by Sonora Quest Laboratories. You have the right
to opt out of programs that we offer. In other cases, we will contact you to obtain your
authorization before using or disclosing your PHI for marketing purposes.


Your rights concerning privacy and confidentiality
Access: You or your authorized or designated personal representative has the right to
inspect your PHI. Sonora Quest Laboratories will deny access to certain information for
specific reasons, for example, where state law prohibits such patient access.
Amendments: You have the right to request amendments to your PHI (but not to
require us to make the requested amendments).
Accounting: You have the right to receive an accounting of disclosures of your PHI that
were made by Sonora Quest Laboratories for a period of up to six years prior to the
date of your written request, but not including any disclosures made prior to April 14,
2003 when the Privacy Rule went into effect. This accounting does not include
disclosures made for purposes of treatment, payment, health care operations, or certain
other excluded purposes, but includes other types of disclosures, including disclosures
for public health reporting or in response to a subpoena or court order.
Restrictions: You have the right to request that we agree to restrictions on certain uses
and disclosures of your PHI, but we are not required to agree to your request.
Confidential Communications: You have the right to request that we send your PHI to
an alternate address.
