We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with appropriate confidentiality measures.
  * We may also share your personal information with a business partner or independent reseller (either within or outside the United States) so that the business partner or independent reseller can contact you and facilitate the support, renewal, and purchase of our products and services. You may receive a communication directly from one of our business partners or independent resellers. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance appropriate confidentiality measures. To find out the names and locations of the business partners and/or independent resellers to whom we have provided your information, please contact us at the address given at the end of this Privacy Policy.

We may share with third parties aggregate, non-personal information. Such information does not identify you individually.

### Choice/Opt-out

We provide you with the opportunity to "opt-out” of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference at the time the information is collected.

If you no longer wish to receive our promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in the applicable message, by setting preferences as may be otherwise indicated on the Site or by contacting Sonatype at the address set forth at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.

If you receive a marketing communication from our subsidiaries, business partners or independent resellers, you should opt-out with that entity directly.

### Links

This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Sonatype. The Site may contain links to other third party websites. Even if the third party is affiliated with Sonatype through a business partnership or otherwise, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the Site to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. 

### Accessing and Updating Personal Information

When you use the Service, you may contact Sonatype at any time to correct your personal information if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we make any correction to your information, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Please note that if you cease using the Service or we terminate your access to the Service in accordance with our Terms of Service, you may no longer have the ability to update your personal information.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or your password), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology ("SSL”). (To learn more about SSL, go to <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer>). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is one hundred percent secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
