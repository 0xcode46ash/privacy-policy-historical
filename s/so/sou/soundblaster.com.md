**Information we collect**

**Non-personally identifiable information**  
As a visitor to our Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information. We do, however, collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks were "clicked" with Cookies. Such information is not linked to any personally identifiable information. The non-personally identifiable information we collect help us identify the most popular areas of our Site and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities.

  * Cookies  
Cookies are text files that store some information on your computer's hard drive and allow our systems to recognize your browser. Cookies collect information like IP addresses, operating systems and browser software, but they do not collect any personal information. Cookies let you customize your experience at our Site.

We also use cookies to record anonymous information pertaining to particular web pages viewed, which helps us in analyzing trends, tracking user's movement, and gathering broad demographic information for aggregate use. In this effort, we also use measurement technology from RedSheriff, an independent measurement and market research company. To find out more about RedSheriff, their technology, and their privacy policy, please visit [www.redsheriff.com](http://www.redsheriff.com/).

At some Creative sites, you can order products, register for materials, make requests, download software, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services, such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide when you register your ownership of Creative products.
