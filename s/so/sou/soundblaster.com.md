**Privacy Policy**  
\- last updated May 30, 2001

1\. Introduction

Creative is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. This corporate wide Online Privacy Policy discloses the information practices for Creative's sites on the Web.

You can visit most of Creative's sites without providing us any information about yourself. However we will sometimes ask you to submit your personal information in order to provide services such as to respond to your inquiry, process your order, provide you access to specific account information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before you use any of Creative's web sites. The application of this Privacy Policy is only to sites controlled by Creative or its subsidiaries and not to web sites controlled by other companies or organizations we link to.

2\. Collection of information

Information we collect

(1) Non-personally identifiable information

When you visit one of our web sites, we may store some information on your computer's hard drive in the form of a "Cookie". Cookies are text files that identify your computer to our server and do not collect any personal information in themselves. We may use cookies to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at our Sites. To do so, the cookies we use may record non-personally identifiable information pertaining to your preferences for viewing particular web pages. We may also use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information to help us in analyzing trends, tracking user's movement, and gathering broad demographic information for aggregate use.

(2) Personally identifiable information

At some Creative sites, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. We will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others.

3\. Why information is collected

  * Creative online shop  
To process your order, we will ask you for your personal information such as: name, e-mail address, delivery address, telephone number and credit card information.  

  

  * Online Registration  
During product installation you will be asked to register your product using an online registration application. By registering your product you become eligible for telephone and online technical support. Information collected from online registration will be used to improve our products and services and internal reports will not contain individual data. With your permission, we will send you information about new products or services from Creative.  

  

  * Surveys and Promotions  
From time to time our site requests information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as postal code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.   

  * Mailing lists  
Creative occasionally provides the opportunity for visitors to supply their email address for the purpose of receiving specific newsletter or product information. These email addresses will only be used for this purpose and will never be shared with third parties unless you have provided your consent through online registration, the online store or other channels.  


4\. Access to personal information and Security of personal information

How does Creative protect consumer information?

Creative takes significant steps to protect your personally identifiable information with secure servers, from simple name registration to encrypted financial data used in e-commerce transactions. Any information you provide us is maintained and accessible only by Creative and its Network Sites.

Third Party Partners

Creative may work with other companies to provide offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. You will only receive notification of these offers if you have indicated your willingness to be contacted for such purposes. In these cases, your data remains secure with us. Creative will not sell or loan your data to third parties nor will any of the third parties be allowed access to your data.

5\. Children's information

While Creative's web sites publish few, if any, contents that are targeted at children, we are committed to comply with applicable laws and requirements, such as the United States' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Children without the consent of their parent or guardian should submit no personally identifiable information to Creative's web sites. Creative will not knowingly collect from or use any personally identifiable information of children for any purpose, including disclosure to third parties.

6\. Europe's data protection 

Because Creative operates globally, we make information we collect available to our worldwide business units. For those of you visiting us from the European Economic Area, please note that Creative will transfer your personally identifiable data outside the European Economic Area for use for any of the purposes described above. By using our web site and providing us with your personal data, you consent to such transfer of your personal data.
