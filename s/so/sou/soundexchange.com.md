# SoundExchange | Privacy Policy

Effective July 23, 2009

SoundExchange, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors, members, and registrants that access this website or provide information through it. Throughout this Privacy Policy, the terms “SoundExchange,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to SoundExchange, Inc. The following sets forth our information gathering and disclosure practices.

**Collection of Personal Information**

In certain parts of this website, we may ask you to provide us with your name, mailing address, E-mail address, company name, phone number, social security number, tax information, birth date, place of birth, and other personal information. We collect certain usage information about our website, such as the number and frequency of visitors to certain parts of the website. SoundExchange may provide aggregate statistics about our users’ traffic patterns, the number of members who have signed up with SoundExchange, the different types of copyright owners and artists that comprise our membership pool, and related site information to third-parties, but this information will not include personally-identifiable information.

**Use of Personal Information**

If you are registered with us, we will use your personal information to ensure we properly collect and pay you for earned royalties. We may also use your information to respond to requests for technical support, to provide registered users with access to and use of our PLAYS Search Engine, to improve the SoundExchange service, to send you communications including newsletters and other notifications, and for other uses consistent with SoundExchange’s business purposes. From time to time, SoundExchange participates in political advocacy regarding important intellectual property ownership and performance rights. We may send you emails to seek your involvement and assistance in campaign activities, such as signing petitions or surveys, or sending emails including your information to political representatives. If you have questions about, or would like to opt out of, one or more of the ways SoundExchange plans to use your personal information or keep you up to date about its operations, activities and services, please send an email to: account_services@soundexchange.com.

We may enter into relationships with third parties who either: (a) provide vendor services to us (e.g. data management, billing, and storage services) or, when necessary, (b) assist us in completing or effectuating payment of royalties (e.g. sharing personal information to ensure payment is made properly). In either circumstance, we disclose personal information only to the extent it is necessary, and we further require that the third party maintain the confidentiality of your personal information. SoundExchange does not otherwise share, nor does it sell, trade or rent, your personal information to third parties.

**Security**

Although SoundExchange uses reasonable efforts to safeguard your personally-identifiable information, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. All third parties that provide services for us are obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with SoundExchange’s policies, except if we inform you otherwise at the time of collection. We are not responsible, and will have no liability for, disclosure of personally-identifiable information due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized acts of third parties.

**Online Registration**

SoundExchange’s Online Registration Form provides copyright owners and featured artists with the ability to register for SoundExchange royalties electronically and to electronically sign our Membership Agreement(s). Registrants will need to enter specific, personal information about themselves and may be asked to provide specific information about the sound recordings which they own or on which they performed. Any such personally identifiable can be modified at your request as set forth in the Online Registration Form.

By signing up through the Online Registration Form, you authorize SoundExchange to be your nonexclusive agent and to use this information to collect and distribute royalties. This means, among other things, that you authorize us to share such registration information with other organizations, such as foreign performing rights organizations, as necessary in furtherance of collecting, and/or distributing and effectuating payment of, royalties. SoundExchange may also use the information for internal purposes in order to facilitate software and process development.

All information provided to SoundExchange through the Online Registration Form is stored on secure systems not accessible to the public. A third party vendor maintains and operates the system, which is also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with SoundExchange’s policies, except if we inform you otherwise at the time of collection.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**

Except as described herein, we will only make your personal information available to non-affiliated third parties in the following circumstances:

If we are compelled to do so by law or by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g. to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process);  
If we believe your actions violate a law, regulation, this Privacy Policy or any applicable Website terms of use, or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of us, our Website, any other users or third party; or  
If, in our sole discretion, we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect our assets, to defend our interests or comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.

**Visitors Under the Age of 13**

SoundExchange does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If a child under 13 submits personal information to SoundExchange and we learn that that personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

SoundExchange reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes and/or modifications shall be posted on the SoundExchange website and shall be effective immediately upon the posting thereof. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the SoundExchange website and online registration following the posting of changes and/or modifications to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of the revised policy.
