# Privacy Policy

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, SourceMaking.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

SourceMaking.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SourceMaking.com’s visitors use its website. From time to time, SourceMaking.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

SourceMaking.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. SourceMaking.com does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to SourceMaking.com’s websites choose to interact with SourceMaking.com in ways that require SourceMaking.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that SourceMaking.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.

For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and email address. In each case, SourceMaking.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with SourceMaking.com. SourceMaking.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

SourceMaking.com may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, SourceMaking.com may reveal how many downloads a particular version got, or say which plugins are most popular based on checks from api.SourceMaking.com, a web service used by WordPress installations to check for new versions of WordPress and plugins. However, SourceMaking.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

SourceMaking.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on SourceMaking.com’s behalf or to provide services available at SourceMaking.com’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using SourceMaking.com’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. SourceMaking.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, SourceMaking.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when SourceMaking.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SourceMaking.com, third parties, or the public at large.

If you are a registered user of a SourceMaking.com website and have supplied your email address, SourceMaking.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with SourceMaking.com and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.

SourceMaking.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies
