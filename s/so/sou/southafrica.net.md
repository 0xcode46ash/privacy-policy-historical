This information may be stored on our servers in South Africa. Such information is usually deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business, but can be amended or deleted upon request. To review, amend, or delete user information, contact [info@southafrica.net](mailto:info@southafrica.net).

**COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
The southafrica.net website may use persistent cookies, clear GIFs and log file information (such as Internet Protocol Address and referring URLs) about user activity at this site in order to understand website usage and to resolve any problems, for example, in navigation thus enhancing the user experience at this site.  Information about those cookies or website usage is not combined with either the any ad-serving cookies or email cookies nor is information about the cookie or log file information linked with any personal information a user may have provided at the website.   
In addition, South African Tourism may serve ads on its website. In doing so our ad server will place or read a unique ad-serving cookie on a user’s computer and will use non-personal information about the user’s browser and activity at this site to serve ads to them on this and other sites.   
If a user has visited this site by clicking on a banner ad for our products and services, a temporary or "session" cookie may be set on the user’s browser. This cookie will contain either an identification number for the ad that was clicked on, or will contain an identification number for the site that was visited when the user clicked on the banner ad. After the user has arrived at SATW, and requests further information from South African Tourism about their products and services, the personal information provided during that request will be linked to the information in the session cookie so that South African Tourism’s Marketing Department can measure the effectiveness of the advertising. This "linking" will **not** be used to target future advertisements to the user or to send the user emails about future goods and services, unless indicated by the user on the product request page. As this is a session cookie, it will disappear from the user’s cookie folder once the browser has been closed. If the user returns to the site via one of South African Tourism ads, they will appear as a new visitor until they provide further personal information.
