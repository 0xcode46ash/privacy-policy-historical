## Privacy Statement for the SoundHound web site and Mobile Applications

SoundHound values the privacy of our users. We encourage you to become familiar with how we collect, use, and share information gathered through our web site and applications.

As you use the SoundHound web site and applications, we collect non-identifying information such as your search and browsing history ("usage information"). Your browser supplies various non-identifying information, including cookies and an IP address. Cookies may include third party cookies, such as Google Analytics cookies (used to gather statistics about the use of the web site and applications) and advertiser cookies (used to improve the relevance of advertisements displayed on the web site and in the applications), as well as SoundHound cookies. If you block cookies, the web site and applications may not function correctly. We may share non-identifying usage information with our vendors, suppliers, and others.

When you use the SoundHound applications, your mobile device supplies a unique identifier, which we use to associate search results, your bookmarks, and other information with your device. We improve the relevance of information provided in the applications using location information provided by your device, which you can choose to turn off. If your browser supplies location information (determined by your browser settings), we may use that information to improve the relevance of information provided by the web site. Content provided by advertisers and other third parties may be personalized in a similar manner.

If you register with SoundHound, the information you supply about yourself may be used by SoundHound to communicate with you and to provide better service to you. If you connect a SoundHound application to your social networks (or other third party services or applications), and give SoundHound permission to access your profile information, SoundHound may store and use that information to communicate with you, to update your status on your networks, to send messages on your behalf to your networks, and to provide other features and services to you. SoundHound will not share your name, email address, or other personally identifying information with other companies, except as needed for SoundHound to supply its services or communicate with you. Exceptions: SoundHound may disclose your information in response to legal process, or as otherwise required to comply with the law; to protect the rights or property of SoundHound or our customers; when SoundHound has a good faith belief that disclosure is, necessary to protect the personal safety of any person; or to a successor in interest to the SoundHound web site, applications, or related business assets. SoundHound may share non-identifying information with advertisers and other third parties to improve the relevance of the content provided by those third parties.

Consistent with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) without requiring parental consent. Any person who provides their personal information to SoundHound through the web site or applications represents that they are 13 years of age or older.

The SoundHound web site, applications, and related services are operated from the United States of America. By using our web site or applications, you consent to the application of U.S. law to your information and to this privacy statement.

This Privacy Statement does not apply to links you follow from the SoundHound web site and applications to other sites, services, applications, or online stores. For example, if you use the Sharing features to send a tweet or to post on a social network, the information you send will be visible to others. To understand how other sites, services, applications, and online stores handle your information, please refer to their respective privacy policies. Your usage of midomi.com is governed by a different Privacy Statement.

SoundHound may revise this policy at any time, and the changed policy will be made available on our website with an updated effective date. By using our web site or applications, you signify your acceptance of the revised policy. We encourage you to periodically review this policy so you know how we are protecting your information.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this Privacy Statement, please email us at [privacy@soundhound.com](mailto:privacy@soundhound.com).
