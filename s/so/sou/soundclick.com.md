# Privacy Statement

**Privacy Statement**

SoundClick is committed to protecting your privacy online. We are also committed to providing you with the very best experience we can on our Web site. In order to enhance your experience at our site we gather certain personal information about you that helps us customize our content to your tastes and preferences.

This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. 

**What information do we collect?**  
SoundClick collects information in several ways from different parts of our Web site. 

SoundClick collects some personal information when you initially sign up for some of our free services. We may ask for your name, e-mail address, zip code, and country. The more information you share with us (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to enhance and customize your experience on our site. 

In addition to the former information, we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you make a purchase through our online store, when you enter promotions or contests and when you respond to a survey. For example, when you make a purchase through our online store, we collect several items of personal information, including your billing and shipping address, telephone number, credit card information, and any other information necessary to complete the transaction. For your security, we never store credit card information on our servers. We transmit credit card information directly to the third party credit card processor through secure connections.

Wherever SoundClick collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.
