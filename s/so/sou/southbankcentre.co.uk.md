Once you have a user account, you can manage your preferences at any time in the My Account section of the website. We will not contact you for marketing purposes unless one of these boxes is ticked. We will include opt-out instructions in any marketing communications you receive from us.

Many of the events at Southbank Centre are presented in partnership with other companies such as with our Resident Orchestras and other artistic organisations and promoters. If you select either the Email or Post option under ‘I would like to hear about events, news and offers from the artists or companies presenting the events I’ve booked’, we will tell the relevant companies that you would like to hear from them, and we will let them know about your booking. This means that we will give them your name and contact details. We will not share sensitive information or your payment details.

We sell tickets on behalf of our Resident Orchestras, and we share a customer database with them. If you buy a ticket from southbankcentre.co.uk for a Resident Orchestra’s perfomance, your name, contact details and records of the tickets you have bought will be visible to that orchestra. The orchestra will use your data for for customer service and analysis. If you select either the Email or Post option under ‘I would like to hear about events, news and offers from the artists or companies presenting the events I’ve booked’, the Resident Orchestra may additionally contact you for marketing purposes.

To opt in or out of marketing communications from another company, please get in touch with them directly.
