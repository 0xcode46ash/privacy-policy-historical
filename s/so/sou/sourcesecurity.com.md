# Privacy and cookie policy - SourceSecurity.com

Cookie policy

This document sets out the privacy and cookie policy of Notting Hill Media Limited, of which SourceSecurity.com is a division (“We”/“Us” and “Our”) and explains how We use your personal information (“Your Information”).

**What information do we collect?**

When you register with Us, we collect information about you and your usage of the website [www.sourcesecurity.com](https://web.archive.org/) (the “Website”) including, without limitation, the following: your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, user ID and password and other information in relation to where you work and what kind of a job you do.

**What do We do with the information?**

We will use the information provided by you to promote a more personal service.  We are required by the Data Protection Act 1998 to follow strict procedures to protect personal data.

We use your personal information collected for purposes which may include the following:

  * to help us to provide you with the Services set out in our terms and conditions as efficiently as possible;
  * to help us to identify the validity of users
  * to allow us to contact users when required; and
  * to allow us to mail users with information about SourceSecurity.com (such communications may include advertisements for third party products)



We also do research on our users’ interests and behaviour based on the information provided to us when you register to use our Services and whilst you use our Services.  This research is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis.  We may keep a record of which products and services you are interested in.  We also monitor user traffic patterns and site use.

Also, We disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users bought product x last month) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

**Will We pass your information on?**

We will not pass the information we collect about you to any other third party other than as set out in this section “Will We Pass Your Information On?”.

If you have registered for the “online sales enquiries” service and you subsequently provide us with a request or query your request or query is passed on to the relevant supplier together with your e-mail address so that the supplier can contact you direct with an answer to your query or request.

If you have registered for our product brochure ordering service and you subsequently provide us with a brochure order your order will be passed on to the relevant supplier together with your address so that the supplier can send the brochure to you direct.

If you do not want us to forward your e-mail address or address to any third party supplier please do not opt for the “online sales enquiries” service or the product brochure ordering service.

In addition we disclose Your Information in a non-personal identifying form (generally in the form of statistics) to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties in order to describe our services to them and for them to analyse the use of the Website.

**Unsubscribing/Amending Your Information**

You can amend or remove Your Information that you give us via our Website(s) at any time.

You can remove Your Information from our database entirely by sending an email to info@sourcesecurity.com specifying your name, the email address/ telephone number you used to register with us and if referring to a web registration, your user name in the email.

Alternatively, whenever we contact you, (for example to send you an email newsletter which you have requested) you will normally find an email address at the bottom of the email, which you can use to tell us if you no longer wish to receive the newsletter or other communication in question.

You can amend or update your information or personal preferences at any time, or raise comments or questions about privacy issues, by sending an email to info@sourcesecurity.com.

**Cookie policy**

In order to improve your SourceSecurity.com experience, we use a feature of your internet browser called a ‘cookie’ to track site usage and remember your settings.

We **do not** track any personally identifiable information about you from your computer, and we will only gain such information if you have knowingly and willingly provided such information to us.

_Your Acknowledgement_  
We hope that after you have read our policy you will have sufficient details about the ‘cookies’  used on SourceSecurity.com to be reassured that we use them responsibly. If you have any further questions, please contact us via any of our standard contact methods.

_What is a cookie?_  
A ‘cookie’ is a very small piece of information in the form of a text file placed on your computer hard drive by lots of the websites that you visit. ‘Cookies’ allow us to help you get the best out of your visit to the website and improve your user experience, for instance by remembering that you have visited before. They can also be used to make sure that the advertising you see is relevant to you.

For further information about ‘cookies’ please visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)

In this policy we have used the following categories of ‘cookies’

  * Strictly Necessary Cookies
  * Performance
  * Functionality
  * Targeting



This categorisation has been defined by The International Chamber Of Commerce (UK).

_Strictly Necessary cookies_  
‘Cookies‘ are set to help support the structure of the pages that are displayed to you. These help the website to function and enhance the look and feel of the website. They also help to improve navigation around our website and allow you to return to pages you have previously visited. This type of ‘cookie’ only lasts for the duration of the time you are visiting the website. When you leave the website they are deleted automatically.

_Performance cookies_  
‘Cookies’ are used to provide aggregated statistics on visitors to our websites and their browsing behaviour. This enables us to order the site to make customers’ journeys easier, and if necessary make improvements. The data is aggregated and anonymised, which means we cannot identify you as an individual.

To optimise our performance, we use Google Analytics, the world’s most respected and trusted analytics package. You can view their privacy policy here  
<http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/policies/privacy/>

_Functionality_  
Wibiya toolbar (the bar at the bottom of SourceSecurity.com) uses a cookie to remember whether it is enabled or disabled.

_Targeting cookies i.e. Third Party Cookies and Cookies used for Advertising_  
We allow Google’s DFP software to use cookies to track the display of adverts on SourceSecurity.com.

DFP Premium and DFP Small Business use cookies to make advertising more relevant to users and to help publishers and advertisers achieve their goals. Cookies let us build features that prevent the same ad from showing over and over again, enable advertisers to tell powerful stories across multiple pageviews, and target ads based on a user's interests. These features make each ad more valuable and engaging, which is good for users and publishers. Of course not everyone wants targeted ads, so DoubleClick offers an opt-out that users can exercise at any time.

[Click here](http://support.google.com/dfp_sb/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2551880) to see Google's full explanation of how their DFP cookies work.

_Cookie Maintenance_  
You can set your browser to accept or reject all specific ‘cookies’.  You can also set your browser to alert you each time a ‘cookie’ is presented to your computer.  You can delete ‘cookies’ that have been stored on your computer but remember, **if you prevent us from placing ‘cookies’ on your computer during your visit, or you subsequently delete a ‘cookie’ that has been placed, it will restrict features of our website.**

By disabling your ‘cookies’ from the browser settings, you will be restricting the ‘cookies’ that we use to manage our, website and this will have an impact on how the website will function.  This will apply to all websites once ‘cookies’ are disabled via your browser settings and not only SourceSecurity.com.

The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You can also disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.

However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the Website's essential features, we recommend you leave them turned on.

**Security**

We have taken steps to ensure that Your Information is secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorised access.

**Business Transfers**

In the unlikely event that we sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of our business to another party we reserve the right to transfer your information as part of any assets sold or disposed of.  By registering on this site and consenting to these terms, you are consenting to this transfer.

**Transfers Overseas**

Your personal data may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area for processing.  Any transfer of your data is done in circumstances ensuring that your data is processed only in accordance with this privacy and cookie policy and the UK's Data Protection legislation.  By registering on this site and consenting to these terms, you are consenting to this transfer.

**If you have any questions or concerns regarding this privacy statement, please contact the Data Protection Officer at Notting Hill Media Limited, Park House, 206-208 Latimer Road, London W10 6QY, United Kingdom or email us at info@sourcesecurity.com.**
