## Cookie policy

In order to improve your SourceSecurity.com experience, we use a feature of your internet browser called a ‘cookie’ to track site usage and remember your settings.

We **do not** track any personally identifiable information about you from your computer, and we will only gain such information if you have knowingly and willingly provided such information to us.

**Your Acknowledgement**

We hope that after you have read our policy you will have sufficient details about the ‘cookies’  used on SourceSecurity.com to be reassured that we use them responsibly. If you have any further questions, please contact us via any of our standard contact methods.

**What is a cookie?**

A ‘cookie’ is a very small piece of information in the form of a text file placed on your computer hard drive by lots of the websites that you visit. ‘Cookies’ allow us to help you get the best out of your visit to the website and improve your user experience, for instance by remembering that you have visited before. They can also be used to make sure that the advertising you see is relevant to you.

For further information about ‘cookies’ please visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)

In this policy we have used the following categories of ‘cookies’

  * Strictly Necessary Cookies
  * Performance
  * Functionality
  * Targeting



This categorisation has been defined by The International Chamber Of Commerce (UK).

**Strictly Necessary cookies**

‘Cookies’ are set to help support the structure of the pages that are displayed to you. These help the website to function and enhance the look and feel of the website. They also help to improve navigation around our website and allow you to return to pages you have previously visited. This type of ‘cookie’ only lasts for the duration of the time you are visiting the website. When you leave the website they are deleted automatically.

**Performance cookies**

‘Cookies’ are used to provide aggregated statistics on visitors to our websites and their browsing behaviour. This enables us to order the site to make customers’ journeys easier, and if necessary make improvements. The data is aggregated and anonymised, which means we cannot identify you as an individual. 

To optimise our performance, we use Google Analytics, the world’s most respected and trusted analytics package. You can view their privacy policy here <http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/policies/privacy/>

**Functionality**

Wibiya toolbar (the bar at the bottom of SourceSecurity.com) uses a cookie to remember whether it is enabled or disabled.

**Targeting cookies i.e. Third Party Cookies and Cookies used for Advertising**

We allow Google’s DFP software to use cookies to track the display of adverts on SourceSecurity.com.

**Google explains the following:**

DFP Premium and DFP Small Business use cookies to make advertising more relevant to users and to help publishers and advertisers achieve their goals. Cookies let us build features that prevent the same ad from showing over and over again, enable advertisers to tell powerful stories across multiple pageviews, and target ads based on a user's interests. These features make each ad more valuable and engaging, which is good for users and publishers. Of course not everyone wants targeted ads, so DoubleClick offers an [opt-out](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/optout) that users can exercise at any time.

[Click here](http://support.google.com/dfp_sb/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2551880) to see Google’s full explanation of how their DFP cookies work.

**Cookie Maintenance**

You can set your browser to accept or reject all specific ‘cookies’.  You can also set your browser to alert you each time a ‘cookie’ is presented to your computer.  You can delete ‘cookies’ that have been stored on your computer but remember,  **if you prevent us from placing ‘cookies’ on your computer during your visit, or you subsequently delete a ‘cookie’ that has been placed, it will restrict features of our website.**

By disabling your ‘cookies’ from the browser settings, you will be restricting the ‘cookies’ that we use to manage our, website and this will have an impact on how the website will function.  This will apply to all websites once ‘cookies’ are disabled via your browser settings and not only SourceSecurity.com.

The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You can also disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.

However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the Website's essential features, we recommend you leave them turned on.

**Links**

The Website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites and we assume no responsibility whatsoever in respect of such sites.   You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the site in question.

**Security**

We have taken steps to ensure that Your Information is secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorised access.

**Group Companies**

We may share your information with other companies which are with the same group as Notting Hill Media Limited or affiliated companies. 

**Business Transfers**

In the unlikely event that we sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of our business to another party we reserve the right to transfer your information as part of any assets sold or disposed of.  By registering on this site and consenting to these terms, you are consenting to this transfer.

**Transfers Overseas**

Your personal data may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area for processing.  Any transfer of your data is done in circumstances ensuring that your data is processed only in accordance with this privacy policy and the UK's Data Protection legislation.  By registering on this site and consenting to these terms, you are consenting to this transfer.

For your protection, we are registered under the Data Protection Act 1998 and have given all the appropriate notifications to the Information Commissioner.
