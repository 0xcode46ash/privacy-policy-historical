# Privacy policy | Clutch.co

Last revised on November 4, 2014

The mission of Clutch is to connect buyers and sellers of business services. To achieve our mission, we make services available through our website to assist buyers in identifying prospective service providers and leaving reviews, and we assist service providers in marketing their companies and services.

We protect your personal information and will only provide it to third parties:

  * With your consent;
  * Where it is necessary to carry out your instructions;
  * As reasonably necessary in order to provide Clutch features and functionality to you;
  * As we reasonably believe is permitted by law or regulation; or
  * As necessary to enforce our User Agreement or protect the rights, property, or safety of Clutch, its users, and the public.
  * We have implemented appropriate security safeguards designed to protect your information in accordance with industry standards.



We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice through our website or other services or by other means so that you may review the changes before you continue to use Clutch. If you object to any changes, you may stop using the Service and close your account. Continuing to use Clutch after we publish or communicate a notice about any changes to this Privacy Policy means that you are consenting to the changes.

### Information We Collect

Our Privacy Policy applies to anyone using the Clutch Website. The personal information provided to or gathered by Clutch is controlled by Clutch, 1200 18th Street, NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC 20036. If you have any concern about providing information to us or having such information displayed on the Clutch services or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you should not use the Website or register on Clutch. If you have already registered, you should close your account.

We collect information when you use the Clutch website or participate in our research process. When you create an account with us, you provide us with personal information (including your name and email address) either directly or via your LinkedIn account. You understand that, by creating an account, Clutch and others will be able to identify you by your Clutch user profile, and you allow Clutch to use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our User Agreement. We may also ask for your credit card details if you purchase certain Clutch services.

You may also share personal information of other individuals (e.g. clients) such as name, email, phone number and company to support our reference check and review process. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing Clutch with their personal information. Client personal information is only used in the reference check and review process and is managed in accordance with other personal information collected by Clutch. Note, when we publish reviews, your clients have the option of keeping their review anonymous or being identified on the review (full name, title, company, photograph, etc.).  

We use cookies and similar technologies to help us recognize you, improve your Clutch experience, increase security, and measure use of our Services. You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools. By visiting Clutch, you consent to the placement of cookies and beacons in your browser in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We do not share personally identifiable information with any third-party advertiser or ad network, although your user profile is visible to other Clutch users and may be visible through public search. Additionally, Clutch currently does not share any personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

When you visit or leave Clutch by clicking a hyperlink we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came or the one to which you are directed. Also, advertisers receive the URL of the page that you are on when you click an ad on Clutch. We also receive the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer or the proxy server that you use to access the web, your computer operating system details, your type of web browser, your mobile device (including your mobile device identifier provided by your mobile device operating system), your mobile operating system (if you are accessing Clutch using a mobile device), and the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier.

Clutch is a dynamic, innovative environment, which means we are always seeking to improve the services we offer you. We often introduce new features, some of which may result in the collection of new information. Furthermore, new partnerships or corporate acquisitions may result in new features, and we may potentially collect new types of information.

### How We User Your Personal Information

When you join Clutch, you acknowledge that information you provide (user profile, company profile, reviews, etc.) can be seen by others and used by us as described in this Privacy Policy and our User Agreement.

By providing information to us when you create or update your account and profile, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of Clutch's User Agreement and freely accepting and agreeing to our processing of your personal information in ways set out by this Privacy Policy. Supplying information to us, including any information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw or modify your consent to Clutch's collection and processing of the information you provide at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, by changing your settings, changing your user profile, changing other submitted data (company profile, reviews, etc.), or by closing your account.

We communicate with you through email, notices posted on the Clutch website, and other means available through the Service. Examples of these messages include: (1) welcome and engagement messages - when you register on Clutch, we may send you a series of emails to inform you about how to best use Clutch as well as new features; (2) service messages – these will cover service availability, security, and other issues about the functioning of Clutch; (3) promotional messages –may contain promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners.

Any information you put on your user profile and any content you post on Clutch may be seen by others. We don’t provide any of your non-public information (like your email address) to third parties without your consent, unless required by law, or as described in this Policy.

Posting content on Clutch may result in displaying some of your personal information outside of CLutch. For example, when you post a Review, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in search engine results.

If you provide any reviews or testimonials either about Clutch or Service Providers covered in our research we may post those reviews or testimonials or portions thereof in. Reviews or testimonials and advertisements may include your name, title, company and other personal information that you have provided.

Clutch may share your information with third-party vendors or business partners who provide services or functions on our behalf, which may include business analytics, customer service, marketing, and fraud prevention. We may also authorize third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including as necessary to operate features of our website. Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.

We may also disclose your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of the assets of Clutch, a subsidiary, or division, or as the result of a change in control of the company or one of its affiliates, or in preparation for any of these events. Any third party to which Clutch transfers or sells Clutch's assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.

### Your Choices & Data Retention

You have a right to (1) access, modify, correct, or delete your personal information controlled by Clutch regarding your user profile on the Service, (2) change or remove your content (company profile, portfolio items, reviews, etc.), and (3) close your account. You can also contact us for any account information which is not on your profile or readily accessible to you. If you close your account, your information will generally be removed or unpublished from the Service within 24 hours.

Note, information that others have copied may remain visible and you may not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information about you that others copied or exported out of Clutch, because this information may not be in our control. Your information may be displayed in search engine results until the search engine refreshes its cache.

We keep your information for as long as your account is active or as needed. For example, we may keep certain information even after you close your account if it is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce this agreement or as part of our Website data backup process. We may keep your data in an unpublished format on the Service or in backups of the Website.

### Other Important Information

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes in the way we treat your personal information, or to the Privacy Policy, we will provide notice to you on the Service or by some other means, such as email. Please review the changes carefully. If you agree to the changes, simply continue to use our Service. If you object to any of the changes to our terms and you no longer wish to use Clutch, you may stop using the Service and close your account. Using Clutch after a notice of changes has been communicated to you or published on our Service shall constitute consent to the changed terms or practices.

We have implemented security safeguards designed to protect the personal information that you provide in accordance with industry standards. Access to your data on Clutch is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as credit card information) is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the Clutch Services and Partners (e.g. PayPal). We also offer secure https access to the website. To protect any data you store on our servers, we also regularly monitor our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to Clutch. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information.

Please help keep your account safe by using a strong password.
