Southern Living Online is a Web site maintained by Southern Living, 2100 Lakeshore Drive, Birmingham, AL 35209. We can be reached by e-mail at letters@southern-living.com.

This site collects no personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. In addition, most of our advertisements place a "cookie" in the browser files of a user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information, although it may enable advertisers to relate a user's use of our site to similar information for other Web sites. These cookies are optional and may be refused any time using your Web browser software. 

For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes only the name of your Internet Service Provider, but not your e-mail address. We also aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit. This information is used to improve our Web site.

When you contact us via E-mail or provide your E-mail address in a message to us, we use it to handle your request. From time to time, we may allow selected companies to send you information via e-mail which may be of interest to you. If you would not like to be contacted by E-mail, please let us know by noting your preference in a message to our E-mail address listed above. 

When you become our customer by ordering one of our magazines or other products, you may receive periodic postal mail from us with information on new products and services. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by writing to us at the above address. Also you may receive mailings from other selected companies. You can, however, have your name put on our do-not-share list by writing to us at the above address. Please provide us with your exact name and address. We will be sure your name is removed from the list we share with other organizations. 

In the event that we are unable to deliver your magazine subscription for any reason beyond our control, our obligation is limited to the resumption of delivery when we are able to do so. If we cannot deliver the subscription within 24 calendar months from the date of interruption, we will have no further obligation under your subscription agreement. **KIDS** : Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself to us or anyone else over the Internet. 

Please feel free to contact us if you have questions about this policy.
