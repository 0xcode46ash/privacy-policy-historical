To help prevent and detect fraud or debt we may need to exchange details with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies.

For billing purposes, we may exchange information with the company that supplies your drinking water or is responsible for removing your waste water, where this is not Southern Water, in order that our and their records are as up to date as possible.

The transfer of personal information is completed using secure servers. These servers use high level 128 bit SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption - which is a leading security standard in the e-commerce industry. For your peace of mind, your Web browser may display a padlock, or other, symbol to indicate the site is secure. Clicking the symbol will confirm the security provided.

  25. **Debt recovery**  
    * The Water Industry Act 1991 provides water companies the power to charge for services provided and to demand and recover monies owed.

Charges for water and wastewater services arise out of the occupancy of a property connected, pursuant to s142-s144 of the Water Industry Act 1991 and, therefore, charges are statutory and not contractual.

If you owe us money and do not repay in accordance with our payment terms we will notify you of our intention to file a default and if still unpaid we will inform a credit reference agency.

We may make periodic searches of our own records, via credit reference agency, or other sources, to manage your account with us, including whether to review your existing payment terms or recover monies due to us.

If you have used our services, vacate the premises and do not make payments that you owe us, we will trace your whereabouts and recover debts.

  26. **Credit reference agencies**  
    * We may share your personal information with Credit Reference (CRA) and Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPA) in order to verify your identity for the purposes of fraud prevention and to assist us in managing your account and providing services to you appropriately – for example, if you do not pay your bill and we need to trace or otherwise contact you.
