We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.

If you wish to subscribe or make a payment in such a case, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.

All orders are processed through PayPal. All payment information collected on this website is stored on PayPal’s secure site and is not available to us.

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you provide.

We have implemented security policies, rules and technical measures to protect the personal data that is under our control from:

  * unauthorized access

**Cookies**

We may use cookies in order to customize this site for return visitors. These cookies are not required for site functionality. You are not required to accept any cookies to use this site. We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html). You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by [disabling cookies](http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml) on your browser.
