Security for merchants when ordering Yahoo! Services

Yahoo! uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption while transmitting certain kinds of information, such as financial services information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed at the bottom of most browser windows during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. Credit card number is SSL encrypted whenever Yahoo! requests it for payment or verification purposes. Customer information will be stored securely on our servers. Once customers choose to store or enter a credit card number on Yahoo!, it will not be displayed in its entirety when customers retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number, customers will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of the number.

For information about Yahoo store Security see the [Security at Yahoo!](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/security/).
