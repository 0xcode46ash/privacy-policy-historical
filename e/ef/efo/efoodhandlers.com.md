**Our Commitment To Privacy**  
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

**Information We Collect:**  
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on websites owned by eFoodhandlers Inc *. The information collected includes types of personal information collected at these pages are: 

Name   
Address   
Birthdate  
Phone Number  
Picture (if submitted)

(We do not collect or save credit card information) 

Soon, we will be implemented extended privacy actions to protect customers. This includes, removing addresses, phone numbers and other sensitive information. 

**The Way We Use Information:**  
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not shared with outside parties. We may issue reminder emails for customers whose certificate is about to expire or for special offers on related products and services. That email will include an 'Opt Out' link that will prevent you from receiving future emails.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

**Our Commitment To Data Security**  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and guard against incorrect use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

**What about Food handler Credentials**  
We do allow employers, teachers, and any other who can identify you by First Name, Last Name and Birthdate to view the status and outcome of your training. Refer to the [View Credentials](https://web.archive.org/web/20151211211819id_/http%3A//efoodhandlers.com/VerifyCredentials.aspx) portion of the website. We do not give employer access to information regarding failed tests. When you use a company Purchase Order or Facility code, you are also giving employers access to all information within your registration. Parents who can identify their child, can also gain access to credentials. 

**What about Surveys**  
We may solicit you by email to gain your feedback concerning our services. You will have the ability to 'Opt Out' out of any such solicitations. We also encourage you to submit feedback about your online experience with us using the User Survey link under the Other Options tab. After you have taken a survey, we may contact you to answer a question or to respond to a concern. We also may make your comments available to the public, although no last names will be disclosed. An example might appear like this.
