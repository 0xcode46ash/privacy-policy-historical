We at eFinancialCareers are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users while providing personalized career management services. This Privacy Policy applies to data gathered on the eFinancialCareers network of career sites (the “Site”) as well as all partner career centers, and does not apply to any other information or website. 

The eFinancialCareers sites contain links to other websites which have their own Privacy Policies. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of other websites which you choose to visit via links from our Site. Please consult the policies of those other sites to understand their usage of information. 

**Summary**

In general, we gather information about all our users in relation to general Site usage and use that data in aggregate form only. We may share that aggregate information with partners and clients in order to demonstrate the Site and enable them to improve their use of the service. 

We use the personal information that we collect from you in order to process your registration, provide personal career management tools (such as jobs search agents or resume databases), identify personal preferences and match your needs with relevant products and services. 

**Personal Information**

When you register with the Site, you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information. We do not disclose information about your individual visits to the Site or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, email address, etc. without your permission except when we believe the law requires it. However, we may disclose to our partners and third parties, on an anonymous basis, certain aggregate information contained in your personal information. 

We reserve the right to offer third party services and products to you based on the preferences that you identify in your registration and at any time thereafter; such offers may be made by us or by our partners via us. You may change your preferences at any time by emailing [cs@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:cs@efinancialcareers.com) or updating your preferences from your account under the My Newsletters tab. 

**Consent**

Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information, you are, by doing so, signifying your consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Should for any reason we elect to change our Policy, we will notify you of those changes both here, and by email if identifiable personal data is involved so that you may make an informed decision and keep your preferences up to date. In addition, your data may sometimes also be used by us to inform you about new services or functionality changes to our web site. If you do not wish to receive this information, please send an e-mail to [cs@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:cs@efinancialcareers.com). 

**What and how do we collect information about you and how is it used?**

1\. Certain eFinancialCareers services require registration or login prior to access; this is to ensure confidentiality. 

2\. We will collect information about your tastes and preferences both when you tell us what these are and by analysis of customer traffic, including by using cookies (see below). 

3\. If you enter a contest or promotion, we will ask for your name, address and e-mail address. This is so we can administer the contest and inform the winners. 

4\. We use information collected about you to personalize your visits to our Site and recommend goods or services to you. We also use the information to help us develop the design and layout of our Site to ensure that our websites are as useful and enjoyable as possible. 

5\. Sometimes we might use the information to let you know about new services on or functionality changes to our web site. If you do not wish to receive this information, please send an e-mail to [cs@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:cs@efinancialcareers.com). 

6\. Resumes. The eFinancialCareers resume database enables you to opt to anonymously and confidentially profile your skills and experience to recruiters. 

When activated, your resume can be viewable by recruiters and can remain anonymous if you indicate this preference on your account profile. If you do so, your name and contact information remain confidential and their release remains in your control at all times. If a recruiter wishes to contact you they do so by sending an email to eFinancialCareers quoting the number of your resume and details of their opportunity. This email is subsequently forwarded to you. You may also indicate that you do want to have your resume searchable. In this case, your resume will not be visible to recruiters unless you choose to apply for a job and include your resume. 

It is your decision as to whether you respond to the opportunity or not. If you choose to do so you will contact the recruiter directly. EFinancialCareers does not contact recruiters on your behalf (unless, on each occasion, you expressly authorize us to do so) nor do we recommend or give an opinion to any party as to the suitability of the job opportunity, you, the recruiter or employer. 

We try to ensure that the ability to contact individuals in the resume database is restricted to bona-fide clients such as recruiters, hiring managers, consultants and HR professionals. However, we are not responsible if some other third party posing as a bona-fide recruiter becomes a client, gains access to the resume database and subsequently contacts you. You may remove your resume(s) from our database or make it unsearchable at any time. However you should note that current or former clients of eFinancialCareers may have retained a copy of your anonymous resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of this resume in these circumstances. 

**Children**

The eFinancialCareers Sites are not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. 

**Will we disclose the information we collect to third parties?**

We do not disclose information about your individual visits to the Site or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number etc., except when we believe the law requires it. However, we may disclose to our partners and third parties, on an anonymous basis, certain aggregate information contained in your personal information. 

eFinancialCareers reserves the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate its systems properly or to protect itself or its users. 

**How do we protect your information?**

When you review your information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software encrypts the information that you input before it is transmitted to us. This means that sometimes we may ask for proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser. On revisiting www.efinancialcareers.com, our computer server will recognize the cookie, giving us information about your last visit. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but usually you can alter the settings of your browser to prevent automatic acceptance. If you choose not to receive cookies, you may still use most of the features of our website, including purchasing items. 

**Customer feedback and complaints**
