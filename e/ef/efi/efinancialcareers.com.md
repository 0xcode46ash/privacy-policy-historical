PRIVACY POLICY/YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

eFinancialCareers is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users while providing personalized career management services.

Note: Any reference to 'we' or 'us', 'our' or website are references to the website www.eFinancialCareers.com (the “Website”), the eFinancialCareers network of career sites, and all of our partner career centers. eFinancialCareers provides links to the websites of many other companies to which this policy does not apply. We cannot, and do not, assume responsibility for the privacy or information policies, practices or actions of any third parties.

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how we treat personal information we collect from visitors to the Website, how we use the personal information that we have collected, and the ways you can access and correct your personal information.

#### Summary

In general, we gather information about all of our users in relation to general site usage and use that data in aggregate form only. We may share that aggregate information with partners and clients in order to demonstrate eFinancialCareers and enable them to improve their use of the service.

We use the personal information that we collect from you to process your registration, provide personal career management tools (such as job search agents, résumé databases), identify personal preferences and match your needs with relevant products and services.

#### Personal Information

We respect your personal information and undertake to comply with applicable federal, state and local legislation from time to time in place.

When you register with the Website, you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information. We do not disclose information about your individual visits to the website or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, email address, etc. without your permission except when we believe the law requires it or as expressly provided below. However we may disclose to our partners and third parties, on an anonymous basis, certain aggregate information contained in your personal information.

We reserve the right to offer third party services and products to you based on the preferences that you identify in your registration and at any time thereafter; such offers may be made by us or by our partners via us. You may change your preferences at any time by emailing [privacy@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:privacy@efinancialcareers.com).

#### Consent

You signify your consent to us collecting and using this information by your registration on this website. Should for any reason we elect to change our Policy, we will notify you of those changes both here, and by email if identifiable personal data is involved so that you may make an informed decision and keep your preferences up to date. In addition, your data may sometimes also be used by us to inform you about new services on or functionality changes to our website. If you do not wish to receive this information, please send an e-mail to [privacy@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:privacy@efinancialcareers.com).

#### What and how do we collect information about you and how is it used?

1\. Certain eFinancialCareers services require registration or login prior to access, this is to help maintain the confidentiality of your personal information.

2\. We will collect information about your tastes and preferences both when you tell us what these are and by analysis of customer traffic, including by using cookies (see below).

3\. If you enter a contest or promotion we will ask for your name, address and e-mail address. This is so we can administer the contest and inform the winners.

4\. We use information collected about you to personalize your visits to our web site and recommend goods or services to you. We also use the information to help us develop the design and layout of our web site to improve our sites to that they are as useful and enjoyable as possible.

5\. Sometimes we might use the information to let you know about new services on or functionality changes to our web site. If you do not wish to receive this information, please send an e-mail to [privacy@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:privacy@efinancialcareers.com).

6\. Résumés. The eFinancialCareers confidential résumé database enables you to anonymously and confidentially profile your skills and experience to recruiters.

When activated your résumé is viewable by recruiters but, if you so designate, remains anonymous; if you so designate, your name and contact information remain confidential and their release remains in your control at all times. If a recruiter wishes to contact you they do so by sending an email to eFinancialCareers quoting the number of your résumé and details of their opportunity, this email is subsequently forwarded to you.

It is your decision as to whether you respond to the opportunity or not. If you choose to do so you will contact the recruiter directly, eFinancialCareers does not contact recruiters on your behalf (unless, on each occasion, you expressly authorize us to do so) nor do we recommend or give an opinion to any party as to the suitability of the job opportunity, you, the recruiter or employer.

We try to restrict the ability of persons other than bona-fide clients, such as recruiters, hiring managers, consultants and HR professionals, to contact individuals in the résumé database. However, we are not responsible if some other third party posing as a bona-fide recruiter becomes a client, gains access to the résumé database and subsequently contacts you. You may remove your résumé(s) from our database at any time. However you should note that current or former clients of eFinancialCareers may have retained a copy of your anonymous résumé in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of this résumé in these circumstances.

#### Will we disclose the information we collect to third parties?

We do not disclose information about your individual visits to the website or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number etc. except when we believe the law requires it, however, if we sell our business, we reserve the right to transfer your personally identifiable information to the buyer of the business, together with the other assets of the business.. We also may disclose to our partners and third parties, on an anonymous basis, certain aggregate information contained in your personal information.

eFinancialCareers reserves the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate its systems properly or to protect itself or its users.

#### For young visitors and their parents

The Website is not directed toward children (individuals under thirteen years of age). We do not permit registration or use of the Website by anyone under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. In particular, if you are under 13 years of age, you should exit this Website and you should not provide any personally identifiable information to any site on the Internet without the knowledge and permission of your parent or guardian.

#### Reviewing and correcting your personal information

You may review and correct any personal information we collect from you by visiting [My eFC](http://www.efinancialcareers.com/myEfc.htm).

Opting-out of the transfer of personal information

You may choose to “opt-out” of any transfer of personally identifiable information to a third party as described in this Privacy Policy. You may “opt-out” by contacting us at [privacy@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:privacy@efinancialcareers.com), or by checking any "opt-out" boxes that may be provided during the registration process. Note that, because we will occasionally need to send you certain email messages that are important to your use of the Website, such as system status updates or order confirmations, you will not be able to "opt out" of receiving such messages.

#### How do we protect your information?

We take reasonable precautions to keep the information we collect secure, including organizational, physical and electronic precautions. Our data networks are protected by advanced firewall and password protection systems. Our security practices and policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. Our systems are designed so that only authorized individuals are permitted access to the information provided by our visitors. There is no complete guarantee of security on the Internet, however. In addition, e-mail that you send us is not necessarily secure against interception. As such, we cannot and do not assume any liability for the theft, loss, misuse or alteration of any information transmitted over the internet. You are ultimately responsible for the security of your user name and password. If you have to write it down, please keep your user name separate from your password.

We will not disclose your personal information except when we believe the law requires it. However, in the event that we sell our business, we reserve the right to transfer personal information collected in connection with the business, together with other assets of the business. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the buyer will continue to treat personal information in a manner consistent with applicable privacy laws.
