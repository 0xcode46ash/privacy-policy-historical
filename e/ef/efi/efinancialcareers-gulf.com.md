#### Summary

Aggregate, anonymous information: We gather information about all of our users in relation to general site usage. We use this information in aggregate and anonymous form only. We may share this aggregate and anonymous information with partners and clients in order to demonstrate the activities of eFinancialCareers and enable them to improve their use of the service.

Personal information: We use the personal information that we collect from you to process your registration, provide personal career management tools (such as job search agents, résumé databases), identify personal preferences and match your needs with relevant products and services.

#### Personal Information

We respect your personal information and comply with all relevant UK data protection and privacy legislation governing its collection and use.

When you register on the website and when you make use of our services, you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information. We do not disclose to any third party information about your individual visits to the website or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, email address, etc. unless we have your permission or we believe the law permits or requires it.

At any time, you can make a written request to have access to all the personal information that we hold about you. We will provide this information within 40 days of such request for a small administrative charge.

Where you have indicated at registration (and at any time thereafter) that you are happy to receive employer highlights and other promotions from selected companies, you consent to us sending you such offers. You may opt out of receiving such offers or change your preferences at any time by emailing [privacy@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:privacy@efinancialcareers.com).

#### Consent

By registering on this website, you signify your consent to us collecting and using your personal information for the purposes described here. Should we elect to change this privacy policy, we will notify you of those changes both here, and by email so that you may keep your preferences up to date.

#### How do we collect information about you and how is it used?

1\. Registration: We collect your name and e-mail address from you when you register for eFinancialCareers’ services. This provides you with secure login details and ensures that all information you subsequently provide to us remains confidential. It is your responsibility to keep your personal information up to date at all times. You can amend your personal information by updating your profile at [www.efinancialcareers-gulf.com](http://www.efinancialcareers-gulf.com/)

2\. Your Tastes and Preferences: We also collect information about your tastes and preferences both when you tell us what these are and by analysis of customer traffic, including by using cookies (see below). This enables us to personalise your visits to our website and to recommend goods or services to you. We also use this information to help us develop the design and layout of our website to ensure that it is as useful and enjoyable as possible.

3\. Contests and Promotions: If you enter a contest or promotion we will ask for your name, address and e-mail address. This is so we can administer the contest and inform the winners.

4\. New Services: Sometimes we might use the information we have collected from you to let you know about new services on our website. If you do not wish to receive this information, please send an e-mail to [privacy@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:privacy@efinancialcareers.com)

5\. Résumés: You can anonymously and confidentially profile your skills and experience to recruiters on the eFinancialCareers confidential résumé database.. You expressly consent to the collection and use of this personal information in accordance with this policy. eFinancialCareers will deal with any sensitive personal information in accordance with the Data Protection 1998.

When activated your résumé is viewable by recruiters but remains anonymous. Your name and contact information remain confidential and release of this information to recruiters remains in your control at all times. If a recruiter wishes to contact you they do so by sending an email to eFinancialCareers quoting the number of your résumé and details of their opportunity. This email is subsequently forwarded to you.

You decide whether you respond to the opportunity or not. If you choose to do so you contact the recruiter directly. eFinancialCareers does not contact recruiters on your behalf (unless, on each occasion, you expressly authorise us to do so). Nor do we recommend or give an opinion to any party as to the suitability of the job opportunity, you, the recruiter or employer.

We do our best to ensure that the ability to contact individuals in the résumé database is restricted to bona-fide clients such as recruiters, hiring managers, consultants and HR professionals. However, we are not responsible if some other third party posing as a bona-fide recruiter becomes a client, gains access to the résumé database and subsequently contacts you. You may remove your résumé(s) from our database at any time. However you should note that current or former clients of eFinancialCareers may have retained a copy of your anonymous résumé in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of this résumé in these circumstances.

6\. Transfer Overseas: You may wish your personal information to be accessed by recruiters or by other eFinancialCareers companies based outside the UK or outside the European Economic Area (which may not provide the same protection for such information as offered in the UK). You consent to a transfer of your personal information in the event that the provision of our services to you involves such a transfer.

7\. Business transfer: We may transfer, sell or assign any of the information described in this policy to third parties as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, transfer of assets or reorganisation of eFinancialCareers.

#### Will we disclose the information we collect to third parties?

We will not disclose to third parties any information about your individual visits to the website or personal information that you provide to us unless we have your permission or we believe the law permits or requires it. However we may disclose to our partners and third parties, on an anonymous basis, certain aggregate information contained in your personal information for the purpose of analysis and research into the customer activity and use of our website.

eFinancialCareers reserves the right to access and disclose your personal information where we believe this is permissible or necessary to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate its systems properly or to protect itself or its users.

#### How do we protect your information?

Although no data transmission on the Internet can be completely secure, we do our best to ensure that your personal data is as secure as possible.

When you review your information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software encrypts the information that you input before it is transmitted to us. In addition, we have strict security procedures covering the storage and disclosure of your information in order to prevent unauthorised access to comply with the Data Protection Act of 1998, The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, and other relevant data protection and privacy legislation. This means that sometimes we may ask for proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.
