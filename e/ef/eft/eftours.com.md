Our Commitment to Your Privacy  
This confirms that EF Tours is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. The privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for www.eftours.com. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact our [Webmaster](mailto:webmaster@eftours.com) by email. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/users/watchdog.html). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the website to resolve your concerns. 

EF Tours is committed to protecting the privacy of our online users. We would like to share our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, it is available in the navigation bar at the bottom of every page and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

Our Commitment to Children's Privacy  
Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For that reason, we require parental consent from users under 18 who wish to make a reservation. A child's personal information will be used to complete a reservation but it will not be used in circumstances outside of what is required to operate the business or site.  
Collection of Personal Information  
On our site, you can order products and materials, make payments on your account, and sign up to lead or travel on a tour. EFTours.com maintains the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information that we obtain from our users. The personal information collected at these pages include your name, address, email address, phone number, date of birth, and credit/debit card information. We also collect financial information such as credit card and checking account numbers. 

When applying for the [MBNA Loan Program](http://www.mbnaamerica.com/), participants will enter a secure area monitored directly by MBNA. 

When you send a digital postcard or tell a friend about a particular tour, we ask for the recipient's name and email address.

The Way We Use Information  
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We are required to collect this information in order to complete your travel documents. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete your reservation. 

Personal information collected by eftours.com is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. However, should you provide personal information through chat sessions or email exchanges, the Privacy Policy does not cover this type of transfer of your personal information. We will protect your privacy to the best of our ability by monitoring the sessions, but always keep in mind that when you are in a public forum, you control the information you disclose. You should always be careful when distributing your personal information in this manner. 

We use the information you provide about someone else only to confirm message delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to confirm that message. Information you provide to us to create a message is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the recipient. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

You can indicate that you would like to receive our catalog as well as updates on our new products and services. Information you submit on our website will not be used for these purposes unless you request these services. 

EFTours.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifying information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

Our Commitment To Data Security  
We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of our users' financial information from their computers to our servers by using encryption technology.  
Use of "Cookies"  
"Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is an industry standard, used to provide useful features for customers. Cookies do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of our website if you do so. For example, the complete online reservation process can only be accessed if you accept cookies.  
Reviewing or Changing Your Information  
You can access personal information online by providing your customer number and password when prompted at the log-in. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. 

You can correct factual errors in your personal account directly online up to your final payment date or by sending us a request that credibly shows error via email to webmaster@eftours.com, by calling our toll-free number 1-800-631-8222, or by mailing to One Education Street, Cambridge, MA, 02141. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
