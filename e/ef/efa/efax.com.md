j2 Global Communications, Inc. ("j2 Global") is dedicated to establishing a trusting relationships with its users, based on respect for personal identity and information, by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers all Web properties owned and maintained by j2 Global, including but not limited to [www.j2.com](http://www.j2.com/) and [www.efax.com](http://www.efax.com/) (but excluding [www.j2global.com](http://www.j2global.com/), which has its own Privacy Policy). Because j2 Global wants to demonstrate its commitment to our users' privacy, we are disclosing:

a. | What personally identifiable information j2 Global collects.

f. | How users can correct any inaccuracies in the information.   
  
If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should contact j2 Global Customer Support by email at [privacy@mail.j2.com](mailto:privacy@mail.j2.com). 

**Information Collection and Use**

**Information Collection**  
j2 Global is the sole owner of the information collected on its web properties, including [www.j2.com](http://www.j2.com/) and [www.efax.com](http://www.efax.com/). j2 Global collects information from its users at several different points on our Web sites.

Registration  
In order to use j2 Global services at any level, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address), and a unique identifier. We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which the user has expressed interest. It is optional for a paying customer to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our sites. Users who subscribe to a j2 Global free service are required to give general demographic information, such as gender and occupation.

Order  
When a user purchases a paying service, we request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.

**Information Use**  
j2 Global acts as a passive conduit for the distribution and receipt of its user's fax, voice and e-mail communications and therefore will not monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of a user's private communications unless j2 Global in good faith believes that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on j2 Global; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of j2 Global; or (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of its users or the public. Users should also be aware (and hereby agree) that certain technical processing of and access to fax, voice and email messages and their content may be required to: (a) route the messages; (b) conform to connecting networks' technical requirements; (c) prevent or minimize disruptions to j2 Global's services; or (d) conform to other similar requirements.

Subject to the legal exceptions listed in the Privacy Policy, j2 Global will not disclose to third parties the fax numbers uploaded to our Web sites by our users for the purpose of using jBlast/eFax Broadcast, and other j2 Global products or services.

**Profile**  
We store information that we collect through cookies, log files and third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Web sites, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share personally identifiable elements of your profile with other third parties. Your profile is shared in aggregate form only.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. 

By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. See the "Profile" section, above. 

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. 

**Third Party Advertising**  
The ads appearing on our Web sites are delivered to users through various third party advertising partners. Information about users' visits to our Web sites, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on the sites. Third party advertising partners do not have access to personally identifiable information.

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by j2 Global Web properties only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

**Log Files**  
Like most Web sites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Clear Gifs**  
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information.

We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section.

**Communications from the Site**  
Special Offers and Updates  
We send all new customers a welcoming email to verify telephone number and PIN. Established users will occasionally receive emails containing information about us, updates on new service features, service usage tips, information about third party services that are likely to be of interest to our members, and member satisfaction questions. Paying j2 Global users may opt-out of such notices. Free j2 Global users can cancel service at any time and be removed from such notices as well. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

Service Announcements  
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. 

Customer Service  
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and regarding issues relating to their accounts. We reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.

Spam and Junk Faxes  
j2 Global has a zero tolerance policy for abuse. While we cannot be responsible for external communications received through j2 Global services, it is our intention to use all legally available means to prevent distribution and receipt of unsolicited commercial faxes ("junk faxes") through the service, and we specifically restrict members from taking any actions which impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on j2 Global resources. We ask that any users who are annoyed by receipt of such junk faxes, please report such activity to Customer Support at [abuse@mail.j2.com](mailto:abuse@mail.j2.com).

**Sharing**  
Legal Disclaimer  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. For example, j2 Global may disclose personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or third parties in response to criminal or civil subpoenas.

Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)   
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

Third Party Intermediaries  
We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

Business Transitions  
In the event j2 Global goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given a choice not to have their information used in this different manner, as described in the notification of changes section, below.

**Choice/Opt-out**  
Users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' from having their information used for purposes not directly related to our sites at the point where we ask for information. For example, our registration forms have an 'opt-in' mechanism from YesMail, where users can choose to receive promotions according to their particular interests. Users must proactively choose to receive these promotions.

j2 Global also sends its user base information on special promotions and partner services that we think might be relevant to the user. Users of a j2 Global free service are automatically opted-in to receive this information. These materials are monitored by j2 Global for content and regularity to respect the wishes of our free users. j2 Global free users may opt-out of receiving these promotional materials by either upgrading to a paid service or by canceling their accounts.

Paying j2 Global users who do not wish to receive our promotional communications may opt-out from receiving these communications by clicking the opt-out link included at the bottom of every promotional message.

Users of our sites are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.

**Links**  
j2 Global's Web sites contain links to other sites. Please be aware that j2 Global is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our sites and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by j2 Global's Web sites. j2 Global has advertising and affiliate relationships with dozens of third party sites which drive interested parties to our sites. Information that is collected on these sites does not fall within the auspices of this policy. j2 Global has Co-Brand relationships with some websites. A site is a Co-Brand of j2 Global if it offers j2 Global technology or services to its users under a different brand. The Co-Branded sites will have their own privacy policies specific to each site, and the user should read them carefully before registration. 

**Surveys**  
Periodically, our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of j2 Global's services. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and a choice to opt-out. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys, they may not use customers' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Tell-A-Friend**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our services, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. j2 Global will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit j2 Global's Web sites. j2 Global stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

**Security  
**j2 Global takes every precaution to protect its user's information. When users submit sensitive information via j2 Global's Web sites, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our paid order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also employ security measures to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerks or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.

**Supplementation of Information**   
In order for j2 Global to properly fulfill its obligations to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. j2 Global verifies the billing address on all credit card transactions and may obtains credit reports for some corporate customers. The information obtained from these third party sources is maintained in a manner consistent with j2 Global's Privacy Policy.

Users may choose to import data from their Microsoft Passport Wallet during registration in order to pre-fill in certain fields and expedite the registration process.

**Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the profile page of the j2 Global service patronized by the user.

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes in this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate, so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.

**Contact Information**  
If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at: [privacy@mail.j2.com](mailto:privacy@mail.j2.com).
