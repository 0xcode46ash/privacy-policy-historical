Your privacy is very important to us. However, we collect and, in some cases, disclose information about you as part of the normal operation of our site. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you and what may happen to that information. As described below, some of your personally identifiable information is disclosed to third parties and used by us and third parties. By accepting the user agreement, you expressly consent to such use and disclosure of your personally identifiable and other personal information. 

**Information About You**   
We ask you to provide information when you register for the eFax.com services. This information includes your name and email address, while other information such as mailing address and phone number remain optional. 

It is eFax.com's policy to respect the privacy of its members. Although we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party, we may, in certain cases where you access our site from other third party sites, release your email address to such third party. We do not disclose certain pieces of information, such as your password, PIN, or eFax number at all. We may aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information to third parties in aggregate for a number of business purposes, including running an enhancing the services, but in these situations we do not disclose to other entities any information that could be used to personally identify you. Also, we may use information about you to provide you with ads or offers from advertisers that we think may be relevant to you, but in these cases we do not disclose any personally identifiable information about you to third parties. 

In the course of using our site and our services, we automatically track certain information about you. This information may include the number and source of fax transmissions, the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. We use this information in the normal operation of the site and we may disclose this information on an aggregated basis. 

We currently do not use cookies on our site, although we reserve the right to add cookies at a later time. Among other reasons, cookies could allow us to require you to enter your password only once during a session. Cookies can also help us provide advertising which is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may be required to reenter your password multiple times during a session. 

If you send us correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your use of our services, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past use of the service, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our user agreement. 

**The Content of Your Transmissions**  
eFax.com acts as a passive conduit for the distribution and receipt of your fax transmissions and therefore will not monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of a Member's private communications unless required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on eFax.com; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of eFax.com; or (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of its members or the public. Member should also be aware (and hereby agrees) that certain technical processing of and access to fax and email messages and their content, eFax.com may be required to: (a) route the messages; (b) conform to connecting networks' technical requirements; (c) conform to the limitations of the Service; or (d) conform to other similar requirements. 

eFax.com will store your personal transmissions on its servers for a limited time and will endeavor to purge old transmissions from its servers when the expiration period has run (one to three days for standard service, and up to thirty days for premium services). We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your transmissions (as well as your personally identifiable information), such as firewalls and SSL technology. These are the same technologies that most websites use to safeguard credit card information and other personal information. However, that said, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet (or anywhere, for that matter.) 

**Your Email Address**   
As part of our service, we will send to you your incoming fax transmissions, but in addition we may send to you periodic emails containing information about us, updates on new service features, service usage tips, information about third party services that are likely to be of interest to our members, and member satisfaction questions. For now, we think we will send about 3-4 such email(s) per month. If you do not want to receive these emails, at any time you can cancel your service notifying us via our eFax.com support [form](https://web.archive.org/help/support.html) that you wish to cancel your account. In addition to the periodic emails, we may use your email address to send you administrative notices about your account (such as notices about pending activities). 

**Third Party Collectors of Information**   
Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy customs and policies. Since we do not control the privacy policies of third parties, we encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others. 

**Nondisclosure Can't Be Guaranteed**   
Unfortunately (and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this policy), due to the existing regulatory and technical environment, we cannot guarantee that all of your communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access your transmissions or communications. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or communications will remain private. 

**Junk Faxes**   
Finally, it is our intention to use legally available means to prevent distribution and receipt of unsolicited commercial faxes ("junk faxes") through the service, and we specifically restrict members from taking any actions which impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on eFax.com resources. We would like to ask that any member that is annoyed by receipt of such junk faxes, please report such activity to eFax.com via our eFax.com support [form](https://web.archive.org/help/support.html) so that we can attempt to prevent further junk faxes from the same source.
