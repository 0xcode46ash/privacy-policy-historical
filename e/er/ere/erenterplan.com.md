This website is operated by Multifamily Internet Ventures, LCC (“MIV”), d/b/a LeasingDesk Insurance Services (“LDIS”).  This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to the information that you provide to LDIS via the www.eRenterPlan.com Website where this Privacy Policy appears in the footer, and/or by use of other services (collectively, the “Services”) that may be provided by other means or media, including as set forth below.

 This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you notice of LDIS’s information management practices, including the types of information gathered, how it is used and safeguarded, and the degree to which you may control the maintenance and sharing of your information.  Your use of any LDIS Service or website constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy. 

 This Privacy Policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers’ needs.  You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy regularly as it may change at any time.  The effective date of this Privacy Policy and any revised or changed notice may be found on this Website.

In general, you can visit this website without telling LDIS who you are or without revealing any information about yourself.  LDIS will not collect any personal information about you by means of this website, unless you have provided such personal information to LDIS voluntarily.  For example, certain LDIS Services may require you to submit personal information in order for those Services to function as designated.  Such information might include your name, your physical contact information, including your address and phone number(s), your email address, and certain financial information, such as your credit card, debit card or checking account number(s).  

If you do choose to provide us with personal information, you can be assured that such information is kept in secured databases located in the United States.  We may use anything we know about you to help us serve you better.  We may use it, and disclose it to our affiliates and others, for any purpose allowed by law.  For instance, we may use your information, and disclose it to others, in order to:

  * Help us evaluate your request for a product or Service;

  * Help us process claims and other transactions;

  * Confirm or correct what we know about you;

  * Help us prevent fraud, terrorism, and other crimes by verifying what we know about you; and

  * Process data for LDIS.




We may also collect information about your transactions and experiences, with LDIS and others, such as your payment history, claims, and coverage changes.  When we disclose information to others to perform business services for us they are required to take appropriate steps to protect this information.  And, they may use the information only for the purposes of performing those business services.

Because of the financial nature of our business, websites operated by LDIS are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13.  As such, LDIS does not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children.

You have control and access to the personal information you provide to LDIS.  The “Update Your Policy Information” area of the website allows you to view, correct, or delete, information collected about you, other than your name and physical address.  LDIS may need to communicate with you regarding critical messages relating to your product or Service (such as service messages, renewal notices, or legally mandated notices).  In addition, if you are required to provide LDIS with your email address, we may use it from time to time to notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy, additional services, confirm transactions, or to provide general information regarding your policy.  If you do not wish to be contacted by email for non-policy related communications from LDIS, you may unsubscribe using the link provided on the email you receive.

The personal information LDIS collects is not shared with non-affiliated third-parties for their marketing, or promotional, use.  Therefore, there is no need to “opt-out” from sharing your personal information.  LDIS may disclose personal information to the following categories of non-affiliated third parties with which LDIS, and its affiliated companies, contract to perform certain functions or services on their behalf:  (i) other financial institutions; (ii) other insurance companies; and (iii) other third-parties, such as your landlord.

When you visit this website, we may store some information on your computer.  This information will be in the form of a “cookie” or similar file and can help us maintain and improve this website in many ways.  A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is transferred to your web browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you.  It functions as your identification card, recording such things as Internet address, passwords, and preferences.  It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.  This is all done without LDIS knowing your name or other personal information.  When you visit any LDIS website you are anonymous, unless you chose to identify yourself to us.  Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies.  This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the www.eRenterPlan.com website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any of our business partners.  With most web browsers, you can erase “cookies” from your computer hard drive, block all “cookies”, or receive a warning before a “cookie” is stored.  Please refer to the “Help” portion of the browser toolbar to learn more about these functions.

We may use web beacons (also known as clear gifs) on the Website in conjunction with cookies to compile statistics about website usage. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the Website. We use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on the Website, such as the frequency with which users visit various parts of the Website and to measure Website effectiveness. Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personal information. However, if you choose to provide us with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookies or web beacons. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to other parties authorized by us to collect information on our behalf.

LDIS reserves the right to retain personal information collected through its website, and other means, for the length of our business relationship with you.  In some cases, however, LDIS will retain the information for a longer period if required to do so by law or regulation.  

LDIS may disclose information you provide to third-parties in order to complete a transaction that you have requested, including, but not limited to, processing credit or debit card payments.  Finally, please note that LDIS may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to comply with the law or legal process.  This includes:

  *   If it is necessary for LDIS to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to exercise our rights or defend against legal claims.

  * LDIS believes it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, violations of LDIS agreements, or as otherwise required by law.

  * LDIS transfers information about you if LDIS is acquired by or merged with another company.  In this event, LDIS shall notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

  * Service providers under contract who assist with the services provided by LDIS, including, but not limited to, fraud investigations and bill collection. 

 




LDIS takes commercially reasonable steps to protect against the loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration of personal information, including credit card numbers, collected through this website.  We recognize the importance of security for all personal information collected through this website.  We exercise care in providing secure transmission of your information from your web browser to our servers.  Once we receive personal information, we take steps to protect its security on our systems.  In the event we request or transmit sensitive information, such as credit card, debit card or checking account information, we use industry standard, secure-socket-layer (“SSL”) encryption.  We strictly limit access to personal information to those employees who need access in order to carry out their job responsibilities.  All employees are prohibited from “browsing” through our files and databases.  We train our employees in the application of our need-to-know standard.  We periodically audit for compliance with this standard and we impose penalties for any failure to comply with this standard.
