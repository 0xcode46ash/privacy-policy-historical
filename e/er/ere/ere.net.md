# Privacy Policy - ERE.net

The Electronic Recruiting Exchange is firmly committed to safeguarding your online privacy. Please read the following policy statement, which explains how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many free features.

The policy will tell you more about:

  1. Information We Collect
  2. What Cookies Are And How They Are Used
  3. Our Use Of Your Information
  4. Our Disclosure Of Your Information
  5. Your Use Of Other Users’ Information
  6. How You Can Access, Update, Or Delete Your Personal Information

### 1\. Information We Collect

The Electronic Recruiting Exchange collects your personal information in the User Settings Page the first time you sign up to participate in any of our services. On this page, we ask you to provide us with your full name, email address, password, company name, job title, company type, address, fax, and phone number. Once you register, you are able to take full advantage of the Electronic Recruiting Exchange’s many free services.

In addition to the initial registration, we may ask you for personal information at other times. These include (but are not limited to) when you enter a contest or promotion sponsored by the Electronic Recruiting Exchange, when you post a job posting on our Jobs page, and when you register or request information about our Training Center.

If you contact the Electronic Recruiting Exchange, we may keep a record of that correspondence. The Electronic Recruiting Exchange also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes.

In the course of using our website, we automatically track certain information about you. This information includes the URL that you just came from, what browser you are using, and your IP address. Many sites automatically collect this information. The URL to which you go to next and URLs internal to our site are not tracked.

### 2\. What Cookies Are and How They Are Used

In order to provide customized and personalized services, the Electronic Recruiting Exchange uses cookies on certain pages of our website. Cookies allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.

We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The type of information we collect includes product purchases and pages visited. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company manages the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can “opt-out” of our ability to analyze such data by sending an email to [help@ere.net](mailto:help@ere.net).

### 3\. Our Use of Your Information

Upon signing up for a subscription to the Electronic Recruiting Daily and/or the Electronic Recruiting Forum, you will receive those respective publications in your inbox via email each business day.

The Electronic Recruiting Exchange’s goal in collecting personal information is to provide our members with a customized experience. In addition, we use this information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, and to improve our content and product offerings. We believe that these uses improve our site and better tailor it to meet our members’ needs.

We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the site, to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems. When you are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with the Electronic Recruiting Exchange alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise.

While the Electronic Recruiting Exchange may send subscribers solicitations on behalf of other organizations from time to time, we will at no time disclose any of your personal information to these organizations.

Promotions that run on the Electronic Recruiting Exchange may be sponsored by other companies other than the Electronic Recruiting Exchange or may be co-sponsored by the Electronic Recruiting Exchange and another company. Some or all of the data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you do not wish your data to be shared.

### 4\. Our Disclosure of Your Information

From time to time, the Electronic Recruiting Exchange does rent postal mailing lists (names and postal mailing addresses only) of members to selected third-parties. If at any time you wish to opt out of receiving mailings from both the Electronic Recruiting Exchange and selected third parties, you may do so in one of the following ways:

  * You can send an e-mail to [help@ere.net](mailto:help@ere.net)
  * You can send mail to the following postal address: Electronic Recruiting Exchange, 37 West 28th St., 12th Floor, New York, NY 10001, ATTN: Circulation Department
  * You can call the following telephone number: 212-803-5795



We do aggregate personally identifiable information (for example, 90% of our members are recruiters and HR professionals) and disclose such information in aggregate to advertisers and for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you. Certain information, such as your password and credit card number is never disclosed in aggregate at all. ERE does not rent or sell email addresses to third parties.

The Electronic Recruiting Exchange may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services. At any time you can easily edit your Electronic Recruiting Exchange user settings at [www.ere.net/settings](http://www.ere.net/settings) to no longer receive such offers and mailings. You will need your email address and password in order to access your user preferences.

### 5\. Your Use of Other Users’ Information

The Electronic Recruiting Exchange allows members to choose whether or not to include their email address automatically with any message posted to the Electronic Recruiting Forum. Subscribers who choose to disclose their email address in messages posted to the Electronic Recruiting Forum must be aware that these addresses will be publicly accessible to outsiders via messages delivered via email and through our archives. The Electronic Recruiting Exchange does not have any control over how outsiders use public information. This setting can be changed at any time by going to [http://www.ere.net/settings](http://www.ere.net/settings/). The Electronic Recruiting Exchange will not disclose our members’ email addresses by request from other members or by third parties.

We do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to add an Electronic Recruiting Exchange member to your mail list without their express consent after adequate disclosure.

### 6\. How You Can Access, Update Or Delete Your Personal Information

Once you register with the Electronic Recruiting Exchange, you will be able to review and change much of your personally identifiable information, including:

  * Your email address and password
  * Your name, company name, job title, company type, address, and phone number
  * Your subscription settings



You may edit your user settings at [http://www.ere.net/settings](http://www.ere.net/settings/) at any time by using your email address and password. If you have forgotten your password, you may request your password to be sent to you from the settings screen.

Your Electronic Recruiting Exchange account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will result in not being able to access any members-only area of the Electronic Recruiting Exchange. You can unsubscribe at any time by going to: <http://www.ere.net/unsubscribe>.

### 7\. What Else You Should Know About Your Privacy

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online (such as on the Electronic Recruiting Forum), that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you’re online.
