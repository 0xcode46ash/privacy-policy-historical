This is only done at the user's explicit request, and after the email address has been verified. Users may opt-out of this service at any time from this URL: <http://www.eroticstories.com/notify/remove.phtml> or by emailing the webmaster ([art@artware.net](mailto:art@artware.net)).

Authors can also supply an email address to be displayed alongside the stories they wish to publish (the "public" email address). However, this is not required. When supplied, this is considered public information. Although we will never supply a third party with a list of these email addresses, we obviously cannot keep anyone from collecting this information from the website.
