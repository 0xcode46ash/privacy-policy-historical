### Energy you use

Details of your energy use and property occupation dates. If you have a smart meter we will take consumption data directly from your meter.

### Smart meter information

If you have a smart meter it will also transmit data that lets us know that it is safe and operating and recording correctly .

### Energy you generate

Details of energy you generate under the Feed In Tariff scheme. You're obliged to give us this information so that we can accurately calculate the payments due to you.

### If you apply for Warm Home Discount or Affordable Warmth measures

You will be asked for information about any benefits you receive and money you get from employment, to assess your eligibility for assistance.

### If you use E.ON Drive

We will see details of where, when and how long you charge your vehicle. This lets us charge you accurately for the electricity you use.

### Company data

With regards to companies, data such as names, phone numbers and email addresses of representatives of your company.

### Credit Reference Agencies ("CRAs")

When you join us, buy an additional product or service or set up a direct debit for the first time, we will ask you for your consent to share your details with one or more CRAs to check your identity and see if you may have any problems paying your bills. This means that we will share your personal data with them and they will give us information about you in order that we can be sure about who we have a contract with and see if you might have problems paying your bills.

We may also tell CRAs how you're managing your account and whether you owe us any money. They might share this data with others to help them make informed lending decisions.

CRAs can also help us try to trace you if you have moved and we owe you money or you owe us money.

More information is set out in a Credit Reference Agency Information Notice which describes how the three main CRAs (Experian, Equifax and Callcredit) share and use personal data. This is available from all three CRAS and displayed on their websites. Their contact details are [available here](https://www.eonenergy.com/privacy).

## Automated decision making and profiling

We may use automated decision making, including profiling. This involves processing your personal data without human intervention to evaluate your personal situation such as your economic position, personal preferences, interests and behaviour, for instance in relation to transactions on your account. We may do this for the following reasons:

**To produce statistics for analysis purposes**

**To identify what marketing offers are likely to interest you the most. This should ensure you only see offers that are relevant to you, but may mean you don’t see everything that we offer**

**To assess your credit risk. Factors such as your payment history will determine what action we take to ensure our bills are paid.**

The rationale behind making a decision or building a profile about you will differ in each case but generally we will use what we know about you, your household and your account history and combine this with demographic and general trend data.

All this activity is on the basis of our legitimate interests in protecting our business, tailoring our services and the offers we make and developing and improving our products and services. 

## We'd like to use your personal data to communicate with you by email, text, letter, telephone, social media and via our website. 

With your consent, we will tell you about products and services, promotions, tailored special offers and discounts that we think are likely to interest you.  If you’ve given us permission to send you marketing information we will respect your choices as to how you would like to receive this.

We may send you letters or call you without your prior agreement when we have a legitimate interest in doing this. Our legitimate interest might be:

  * **Understanding  our customer and getting to know their preferences.**
  * ****
  * **Telling  our customers about products that might meet their needs and desires.**
  * ****
  * **Ensuring  our customers are aware when they can save money.**



Sometimes we may also want to rely on these legitimate interests to share your information with other organisations, both within the E.ON Group and externally, for marketing purposes.  Some examples are:

  * **Organisations  who can enhance or match the data we hold with additional information such as additional contact methods and insights, which enable us to understand our customers better and plan marketing activities.**
  * ****
  * **Organisations  we want to work with to promote a product or a product or service we endorse.**



**You’re in control**

We won’t use your personal data to promote anything to you, or for any marketing purpose at all (including profiling you for marketing), if you have told us not to. We will give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving marketing information whenever we contact you directly for this purpose. You can also opt out, and change your consent preferences, by calling us directly or going online.

## Cookies

### How we use cookies

Most internet browsers, like Firefox, Safari or Google Chrome, let websites store simple text files called 'cookies' on your computer. 

They let websites remember things like your username or password so you don't need to re-type them every time you visit. They also help websites see how you use them, and this can be used to improve how websites work. 

We have a legal responsibility to tell you about the kind of cookies we use, what they're for and how to turn them off. We strongly suggest you accept our cookies though, to get the best possible service from our website.

### How do I turn cookies off?

How you disable or delete cookies depends on which version of your internet browser you're using, for instance, Internet Explorer 9. 

You should be able to check this by going to the About section in the Help or Tools section of your browser. 

To find out more, we suggest you visit [aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org/), where you'll find easy to follow instructions for both deleting or controlling cookies from your browser. 

[aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org/) is a third party website, so we're not responsible for the information on it, but we're more than happy to recommend it. 

If we collect or handle your personal data, you have rights as an individual which you can exercise in relation to the information we hold about you.

### Right of access to your personal data

Individuals can find out if we hold any personal data about them, and access that data, by making a ‘subject access request’ under the Data Protection Act 1998. If we do hold your personal data, we will provide you with a copy and information about what we do with it. Unless you ask us to provide it in a different way, we will email this to you where you have given us an email address.

You can request access to our data using any of the methods on our [Contact Us](https://www.eonenergy.com/contact) page.

If you only want to see certain items and you agree, we will try to deal with your request informally, for example, by providing you with the specific information you need over the telephone.

### Other rights you have

If you’ve given us consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time by contacting us. If you have an online account with us, you can also make changes to that preference in your account. 

You can request that we correct any mistakes, restrict or stop processing your data, or delete it. It’s worth noting that in some cases if you do ask us to correct, delete or stop processing it, we won’t always be required to do so – for example we may need to continue in order to service your account in line with our contract. If this is the case, we'll explain why. 

If we are making **** decisions about you based solely on automated processing, including profiling, then in certain circumstances (where we are processing on the basis of a legitimate interest and the decision has legal or similar effects on you), you have the right to have a person make the decision instead. Of course, if we are profiling you for marketing purposes, we will stop altogether.

In certain circumstances (where you provide your information to us (a) with consent to process it or (b) where the processing is necessary for the performance of our contract with you), you can require that we provide the data we hold about you either to you or a third party in a commonly used format. This is commonly called ‘portability’). This only applies if we are processing it using automation only. If you would like more information about this, let us know.

### Your right to contact the Information Commissioner

If you're unhappy with any aspect of how we handle your personal data you also have the right to contact the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the supervisory authority that regulates handling of personal information in the UK. 

You can contact them by going to [their website](https://ico.org.uk/), phoning them on **0303 123 1113  **or by post to:

**Information Commissioner’s Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, SK9 5AF.**

## How long do we store your personal data for?

If you have an account with us, we will retain your personal data for seven years following the end of our contractual relationship with you (which might be when your account closes or when we have issued your final bill.) There may be circumstances when we need to keep it for longer, for instance, if you are on a long-term payment plan or to meet our legal obligations, but we will delete it as soon as we have no need to keep it further.

If we hold your data for any other reason we will delete it as soon as we no longer have a valid reason to retain it. 

## How we keep your information safe

When you log in to your online account or ask us for a quote, our website pages are secure, which means all the personal details you type in are encrypted before they’re sent to us.

We store and use all personal information securely, so it can't be read by anyone who doesn't need to see it.

When you get in touch with us, we'll ask you a couple of security questions before we share any personal details, just to check it's you.

When we use other organisations to help us provide services and manage your account, we have appropriate contracts in place, which limits their use of your data to only what we have asked them to do. We provide only the information they need to perform their specific services and we work closely with them to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected at all times. If we stop using their services, any of your data held by them will either be deleted or rendered anonymous.

## What happens if we send your data out of the European Economic Area?

Data protection laws allow us to transfer personal data to organisations in countries within the European Economic Area (EEA), as those countries are signed up to the same laws and have to have the same controls and safeguards in place to protect your data. We may transfer your personal data to an organisation in a country outside the EEA, in which case we will only do so where the European Commission has declared that the receiving country has an adequate level of protection, or we have a contract in place which includes appropriate data protection clauses requiring that your data is handled to the same standards as we uphold.

If your data is being transferred outside the EEA, then you can obtain details of the relevant safeguards by contacting our Data Protection Officer.
