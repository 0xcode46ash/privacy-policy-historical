# E! Online - Membership - Privacy Policy

|  |  |    
  
  
At E! Online, LLC, we are committed to you and to protecting your privacy. The information we collect about you is used to provide you with a more personalized and richer experience while visiting our site. Please read further for details.  


**How Does E! Online Collect Information?**

**Your IP Address**  
Your IP address is a unique identifier we use to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Website tracking. We also use your IP address to help identify you and your shopping cart, and to gather broad, demographic information.

**Cookies**  
E! Online uses a feature on your Internet Web browser called a "cookie." A cookie is a small piece of information stored on your hard drive. It assigns a unique identification number to your computer and helps us maintain your preferences between visits to provide a personalized experience for you.  


E! Online uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to tell us whether or not you have visited our Website before. We also collect non-personally identifiable information, such as anonymous session numbers, with them.  


E! Online allows other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of E! Online's pages to set and access cookies on your computer. E! Online does not control cookies from third-party advertisers. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the privacy policy of E! Online. Advertisers or other companies do not have to access to E! Online's cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.  


**What About Personal Information? Do You Collect That?**  


E! Online does not house or collect any personal information about you unless you knowingly and willingly provide it.  


**Membership Registration**  
E! Online has a registration process through which you voluntarily sign up to access the members-only features of our Website. During the registration process, we ask for your name, email address, how you got to know us, your age range and your ZIP code. Also, to make sure that nobody else can access our members-only features using your name or identity, we ask that you create a unique username with a password.  


**Newsletter Subscription**  
When you subscribe to our FREE newsletters, we ask for an email address to send them to. You may opt out of receiving future mailings or cancel your subscription(s) at any time. (See the subscribe/unsubscribe section below.)  


**Contests and Promotions**  
When you enter a contest or take part in a promotion, we may ask for your name, mailing address and email address. Should a third party sponsor the contest or promotion, that party will have access to this information. We need this information in order to notify our winners and, when applicable, ship the winners' prizes.  


**Online Purchases**  
At Shop.eonline.com, we sell a lot of merchandise to our customers. When processing an order, we need to know your name, mailing address, email address, credit-card number and expiration date. This information is necessary to process your order and to keep you updated on your shipping status.  


**Does E! Online Ever Share Information with Other Parties?**  


**Disclosure of Information to Outside Parties**  
E! Online does not and will not share your personal information with any outside parties unless you have knowingly and willingly consented to do so (e.g., by entering a contest, promotion or sweepstakes for which we would publish a list of winners). We do collect demographic and profile data, which is aggregated and shared with advertisers. Here's an example of what our advertisers would receive. "Of the 25,371 clicks your banner received, 38% of the those were by users between the ages of 25-34."  


**Links to Outside Third Parties**  
E! Online may establish relationships with reputable business partners by creating a link between our sites. E! Online chooses its business partners carefully. We are not, however, responsible for the content, maintenance or privacy policies of those sites. Once you click over to a third-party site, we encourage you to check their privacy policy.  


E! Online may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than the information practices of E! Online. Users who click over to a third-party site from a link on E! Online must be aware that E! Online makes no warranties with regard to that site's policies or business practices. E! Online is not responsible for any transactions that occur between the user and the third-party site. Please consult the other sites' privacy policies as E! Online has no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. Should a user purchase any products or services from that third-party site, the user must contact the third-party site directly regarding any disputes that might occur, including, but not limited to: delayed shipping, missing products, damaged goods, or pricing or billing discrepancies. E! Online is not responsible for the actions of any third-party site. 

**Children's Guidelines**  
E! Online does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet use. Also, we strongly encourage parents to help us enforce our privacy policy by instructing their children to never provide personal information on this site without permission.  


**Public Forums**  
E! Online has chat rooms, forums, message boards and newsgroups available to its users. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. As these forums are public and open for users to interact with each other, E! Online expects all its users to respect the rights of others.  


**Security**  
E! Online has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We are able to keep your personal information safe and secure by utilizing Secure Socket Layers (SSL) encryption technology. For maximum security, we use a secure server that encrypts all your ordering information, including your name, address and credit-card number.
