**The eHow.com Web Site**   
The eHow.com Web site (“ **Site** ” or “ **The Site** ”) logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user’s session. This gives eHow an idea of which parts of our Web site users are visiting. Information regarding visitors to eHow is aggregated for the purpose of reporting to advertisers, ad sales organizations, and other Web sites. **eHow does not make personally identifiable information (information that can be used to identify an individual user) available to any of these organizations.**

**Cookies**   
eHow uses a feature of your browser to set a “cookie” on your computer. This allows us to measure and report aggregate information to advertisers and business partners, such as the number of people who see their ad (reach) and the number of times people see their ad (frequency). It also allows for the delivery of ads and content that may be more relevant to you and reduces the chance you will receive the same ads too many times. Cookies will also save your password so that you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit eHow.com. 

Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. If, for some reason, you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies to accept. To see instructions for disabling cookies for your browser, click on either [Internet Explorer](https://web.archive.org/web/20000615031120id_/http%3A//www.ehow.com/general/cookies.asp#IE) or [Netscape](https://web.archive.org/web/20000615031120id_/http%3A//www.ehow.com/general/cookies.asp#netscape). 

You may elect, however, to tell us things that you want eHow to remember about you. We hope that you will want to provide information about yourself because it will make eHow that much more valuable to you. If you are comfortable providing us with information about yourself, premium services are available to you that are impossible for us to offer anonymous users. Examples of such premium services are: My eHow, Contribute, newsletters, etc. In these instances, we retain information about you between computing sessions by using a cookie. 

Other companies which place advertising and/or links on our site also have the ability to assign a different cookie to you in a process that eHow does not control. However, since cookies are not useable for identifying individuals, these advertisers will never know who you are.
