**eHow.com is a site designed by consumers for consumers.**   
eHow, Inc. respects your privacy by adhering to the following policies with regard to information you provide to us (either at [www.ehow.com](https://web.archive.org/home/0,1798,,FF.html) or at offline events). Specifically, this statement informs you that: 

  * You can control which personally identifiable information eHow.com collects from you
  * You can control what eHow.com does with this information



**The eHow.com Web Site**   
The eHow.com Web site (" **Site** " or " **The Site** ") logs IP (Internet Protocol) addresses for systems administration purposes. IP addresses are 32 bit numbers that are logged to track a user's session(including browser type, access time and pages viewed). This gives eHow an idea of which parts of our Web site users are visiting. Information regarding visitors to eHow is aggregated for the purpose of reporting to advertisers, ad sales organizations, and other Web sites. **eHow does not make personally identifiable information (information that can be used to identify an individual user) available to any of these organizations, nor will we share, trade or sell your information without obtaining your expressed consent first.**

**Cookies**   
eHow uses a feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on your computer. Cookies can help you save time. If you personalize pages or register for products and/or services, a cookie helps remember who you are. Cookies are commonly used to rotate banner ads that a site sends so that it doesn't keep sending the same ad as it sends you a succession of requested pages. They can also be used to customize pages for you based on your browser type or other information you may have provided the Web Site. In addition, for those sites which provide a "shopping cart", a cookie can store all of the items you place in your shopping cart and facilitate quick and easy checkout. Web users must agree to let cookies be saved for them, but, in general, it helps Web Sites to serve users better. Cookies will also save your password so that you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit eHow.com. 

Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. If, for some reason, you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies to accept. You can order your browser to accept all cookies or to alert you every time a cookie is offered. Then, you can decide whether to accept one or not.

  2. _Internet Options_

You may elect to tell us things that you want eHow to remember about you. We hope that you will want to provide information about yourself because it will make eHow that much more valuable to you. If you are comfortable providing us with information about yourself, premium services are available to you that are impossible for us to offer anonymous users. Examples of such premium services are: My eHow, eHow newsletters and the eHow Shopping Cart. In these instances, we retain information about you in a secure environment between computing sessions by using a cookie.

We require the following two pieces of personally identifiable information: Your e-mail address and a password of your choosing. In addition, you may choose to share additional information (such as “areas of interest” and other information as detailed in the “Collecting Information” section below) with us which we may use to send you information about eHow and promotional materials (based on what you've shared with us) if we think you might be interested. The choice of how much personally identifiable information about yourself to disclose to eHow is completely up to you.

eHow uses information you provide to tailor your experience at eHow, suggest content for you that we think you might be interested in, and display the content according to your preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis, but never on an individual basis. (For example, we may notify our advertisers that 100 customers clicked on their banner ad, but will not disclose any information about those 100 individuals.) We may also use this data for internal purposes. Please note that when we sponsor a contest or sweepstakes with another party, the other party may also collect your information, but only with your consent.
