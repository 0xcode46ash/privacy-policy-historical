We respect all our visitors right to personal privacy and want you to feel as comfortable as possible visiting our Website.

Our privacy policy will tell you what information we collect about you, how we protect it and what choices you have about how that information is used.

When you visit and navigate our Website, we will not collect personal information about you unless you provide us that information voluntarily.

   **Registration:**  
---  
  
You are always welcome to use our Website without registering or providing any personal information. However, for certain services, including free health emails, chats or posting on discussion boards, we require you to register.

If you do register, we ask for your email address, your first and last name, your zip or postcode and year of your birth. We give you the option of providing additional information, including gender, city, state and country.

Any information we obtain about you is used in aggregate form only, that means we simply combine your information with data collected from other individuals to produce anonymous statistical information. For example, the percentage of male to female visitors, or the age range of our most frequent visitors. We never provide any personal details to any third parties, including advertisers and sponsors, though we do provide them with the aggregate anonymous information, like the examples just given.

Any personal information you give us is treated as confidential. We will not disclose to third parties any identifying personal information without first contacting you and obtaining your permission to share this information.   
  
   **Security of Information:**  
---  
  
We use security procedures to protect the personal information you submit, stored in our secure database behind an electronic firewall. Access to our database is limited to a few computer technicians who are required to maintain the database and who can access this database only using passwords.

While no Internet site can guarantee that it is completely secure from people who might attempt to evade security measures, we make every effort to safeguard your personal information.

YourMedicalSource cannot, like every other website, completely ensure privacy of email communications to and from our site because they are not encrypted, and therefore not secure. Emails can be intercepted without your knowledge and permission while in transit to and from our site. Therefore, if you are concerned about your privacy, we suggest that you do not use email to communicate information to us that you consider sensitive.

When you use YourMedicalSource’s “email this page to a friend”, YourMedicalSource emails the article you designate to your friend’s email address and lists your email address as the sender. YourMedicalSource uses the friend’s email address only for the purpose of sending your friend the email you requested and for no other purpose unless otherwise disclosed to you at the time you send the email.   
  
   **Cookies:**  
---  
  
YourMedicalSource does not place cookies on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are small computer files placed on your computer’s hard drive by a Website. It allows the Website to know how often you visit and what you sought on the Website (for example what articles you searched, which chat rooms you visited etc). A Website generally assigns a different cookie to every computer. Cookies can provide valuable information that allows a Website to design advertising and web pages of specific interest to you, and allows the Website to statistically monitor how many people are using the site, and viewing any advertising on the site. Information obtained from cookies can be used to determine the popularity of certain content or advertisements on the site, or target certain advertisements to your browser.

Websites use cookies for user convenience. The cookie will tell the Website certain information so you don’t have to fill in the same information each time you visit. For example, the “send this page to a friend” feature.

If you click on an advertisement of sponsorship acknowledgement on our site, you will be leaving our site and will be directed to the advertisers or sponsors site. YourMedicalSource has no control over the practices of other Websites. Your computer may receive cookies from other sites.  
  
   **Surveys:**  
---  
  
When responding to our surveys we may ask you for demographic information such as your age and gender, town, zip or post code and country. This information is collected only as anonymous, aggregated information and used for statistical purposes.  
  
   **Testimonials:**  
---  
  
We will specifically request your permission to use any complimentary comment you email us as a testimonial. We will request your permission to allow us to attach your name, and where you live, to your comment.  
  
   **Effect of Privacy Policy:**  
---  
  
This privacy policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or legal rights in or on behalf of any party.

This privacy policy may be revised periodically. Recent changes to the policy will be noted in a different color.
