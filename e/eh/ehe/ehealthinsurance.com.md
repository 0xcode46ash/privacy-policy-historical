Furthermore, eHealthInsurance is a registered licensee of TRUSTe.  TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit initiative whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of full disclosure and informed consent.  Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and to have our privacy practices reviewed and audited for compliance by TRUSTe.  These include:

Collection and Use of Information

**Personally Identifiable Information**. Our site uses an application form for individuals and businesses to apply online for health insurance.  To provide you with a health insurance quote or to process your application with the health insurance company that you have selected, we collect your _contact information_ (like your email address and mailing address), _personal health information_ (like your or your family's medical history), _financial information_ (like your account or credit card numbers), and _demographic information_ (like your zip code, gender and state).  If you are enrolling your company, _employee information_ is also collected (like their age, home zip code and family members to be insured).  Contact, personal health, demographic information and/or employee information is required by the health insurance company to process an application form. Additionally, the financial information will be used by the insurance company to bill you after you have been approved to be a policy holder. 

Your contact and demographic information may also be used by eHealthInsurance to get in touch with you when necessary to process your application.  Emails will be sent to you throughout the application process to inform you of the status of your application and additional information that is requested as part of the application.  A postal mailing of your application will be sent to you if you choose to have us mail you the application for signature and submission of payment. Emails, postal mailings and telephone calls are made upon your request or as a friendly reminder to submit your application if we have not received the application for a prolonged period after your online submission. 

Additionally, eHealthInsurance may contact you to survey your satisfaction of our service and/or to inform you of additional products and services available through our website. To opt-out of receiving these additional communications from eHealthInsurance, follow the opt-out procedures below.

**Anonymous Information.** In addition to the collection and use of _personally identifiable information_ to provide you with quotes or to process your insurance application, eHealthInsurance also gathers _anonymous information_ and _aggregate demographic information_ , which may be used by eHealthInsurance or shared by eHealthInsurance with third parties.  This information does not personally identify you, but it may be helpful to us for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.  For example, eHealthInsurance may track the aggregate number of return visitors to our site or the aggregate number of visitors to our site that are men, and eHealthInsurance may share this information with its partners and outside advertisers for general marketing purposes. ** ** Generally this information is collected through “traffic data” and may entail the use of “Cookies,” “Internet Protocol” addresses or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.  Again, disclosure of anonymous information and/or aggregate demographic information by eHealthInsurance will not reveal any personally identifiable information about specific users.

“Cookies” are small files that are stored by your web browser to help a particular system recognize you and the pages you visited in a website.  Our site uses cookies to make your online experience more convenient. For example, we may use a cookie to store your account information between sessions and to maintain information about the quotes that you've requested during your session.  Additionally, we may use data from cookies for a variety of internal purposes, such as studying how users navigate our site.  Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies.  Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features on our site, including obtaining quotes and purchasing insurance. 

**Links to Other Sites.** Our site contains links to other sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links you are "clicking" to another website.  eHealthInsurance is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their privacy policies may differ from ours.

Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information

**It is our firm commitment to you that eHealthInsurance will not sell, trade or give away your personally identifiable or personal health information to anyone, except those specifically involved in the referral or processing of your health insurance application.**   Additionally, eHealthInsurance will (as described below) share your personally identifiable information and/or personal health information **only** with the following categories of third parties:

  * **Service Providers.** eHealthInsurance may provide your personally identifiable information to reputable service providers who provide routine services that are an essential element of our site.  For instance, eHealthInsurance may provide your financial information (like credit card numbers) to an outside service for the secure processing of your credit card payments over the Internet.  **eHealthInsurance does not disclose your personal health information to any of its service providers** **.  ** Additionally, eHealthInsurance will contractually require any service provider to whom personally identifiable information is disclosed to maintain such information in strict confidence and not use such information for any purpose other than for the purpose that service provider has been contracted by eHealthInsurance. 
  * **Co-Branded Websites/Affiliate Partners.**   You may have come to our site from one of our affiliate partner websites or be visiting eHealthInsurance through a co-branded website.  Our co-branded websites are clearly identified by both an eHealthInsurance and a partner’s logo.  As part of these affiliate partnerships, your contact information and/or demographic information may be provided to the specific affiliate partner that referred you to our site.  **eHealthInsurance does not disclose your personal health information or financial information to any of its affiliate partners.**   eHealthInsurance is not responsible for the actions of these affiliate partners, and we encourage you to review the privacy policy from the affiliate partner that you are visiting our site from to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information. 
  * **Legal Obligations.**   eHealthInsurance may release personally identifiable information including your personal health information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or a valid court order.
