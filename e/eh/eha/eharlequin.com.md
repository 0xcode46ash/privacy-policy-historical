# eHarlequin.com: Our Privacy Policy

At eHarlequin.com we respect your privacy and the security of your personal information. This statement discloses the privacy practices for eHarlequin.com . Except where stated otherwise, the term eHarlequin.com used on this website shall be deemed to include Harlequin Enterprises Limited and its respective affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, and assigns. Your privacy is important to us. We are committed to undertaking reasonable measures to protect the privacy, accuracy and reliability of your personal information and to protect such information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Please read the following description of our policies and practices regarding your personal information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of our [Member Agreement](https://web.archive.org/harl/globals/help/00agre11.htm).

 **How We Collect Information**

Many of the ways in which you interact with our site allow us to learn more about you. We collect and store statistics and other information about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (collective) basis. For example, we track the number of people who view each page to learn which features are the most popular. But in these, and almost all other instances, we do not obtain "personal information" about you. "Personal information" is information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, and email address.

In those instances where we do collect personal information, you have the option of choosing to reveal it to us or not. Examples of when you voluntarily submit this kind of information include when you answer our polls, enter sweepstakes or contests, fill out the registration page, make a purchase, sign-up for newsletters, send us feedback or post in our chat rooms or message boards. You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g. user name, email address) on bulletin boards or in chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other Internet users. We do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties.

 **How We Use and Disclose Your Information**

As a general practice, we do not sell your personal information to third parties. So, for example, we do not sell your email addresses or your name and personal demographic information to mass marketers. However, on particular pages where we ask for your personal information, we may explicitly tell you that the data we are collecting on that page will be shared with third parties, in which case those disclosures shall override anything to the contrary in this policy. Therefore, before you submit answers to questions we ask in an advertiser-sponsored promotion, we will tell you that your answers will be shared with that advertiser. We use your information on an aggregated basis to operate our site, enhance our site and sell and deliver advertising. We also use this data, both aggregated and personally identifiable, to personalize and enhance your on-site experience by displaying content and marketing messages that we believe will be of interest to you. We disclose aggregated information about our site to third parties.

In some cases we use your personal information to provide information to you, such as to send you newsletters at your request or to personalize the site in accordance with your preferences. In the event eHarlequin.com is sold, your personal information, which is held in our database, is considered an asset of eHarlequin.com and will be sold as part of it.

**Controlling or Changing Your Information**

You can access and update your personal information by clicking on the account info link. You can also change your subscriptions to our email newsletters by clicking on the link at the bottom of the newsletter. 

**Privacy of Children**

eHarlequin.com understands that children and young adults need special safeguards and privacy protection. These young people may not understand all the provisions of our policy or be able to make well-informed decisions about the choices available to our adult users. We believe our success is not only defined by our ability to bring you online services that make your life more convenient and enjoyable, but also by the steps we take to ensure that the interactive medium is available to everyone and guided by policies that make sense for families. If you are under 18, you may use eHarlequin.com only with involvement of a parent or guardian. eHarlequin.com and its affiliates reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in its sole discretion. In concert with our efforts, eHarlequin.com urges all parents to supervise their children's exploration of the Internet and any online services, and to teach their children about protecting their personal information while online.

eHarlequin.com maintains the following policies to protect the privacy of our users who are less than 13 years of age:

* No information may be submitted on or to eHarlequin.com by users under 13.
* Users under age 13 shall not register with eHarlequin.com.

 **Cookies and Other Tracking Methods**

Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our site. We use cookies or, in a limited number of cases, IP addresses for a number of reasons. First, cookies allow you to store your password without having to constantly re-enter it. Second, cookies can also help us to tailor a Web site or a marketing message to better match your needs and interests. Third, cookies allow us to better understand how users in general use our site, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are most popular with our users. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly if you do.

Note: eHarlequin.com may place advertising on our site that originates from outside advertisers and/or advertising agencies. In some cases, if you click on or view these ads, a cookie may be assigned by the advertiser. eHarlequin.com does not control these cookies.

 **Other Sites**

Please note that if you provide any information on your own or directly to any other sites you encounter on the Internet (even if these sites are branded with our branding), different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties.

 **Limits on Our Abilities**

Although your privacy is very important to us, due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personal information will not be disclosed to third parties. There may be circumstances where the government, or other third parties require access to this information, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to do so) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.

 **Security**

We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers where appropriate.

 **eHarlequin.com's Credit Card Guarantee**

If you are using a credit card, your liability for any unauthorized use will usually be limited to $50.00 by your financial institution or credit card provider. We will reimburse you up to a maximum of $50.00, provided the fraudulent use of your card was not through your own fault, but was a result of purchases made at eHarlequin.com. In this event, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with their notification requirements and ask them to notify us that you are being held liable. eHarlequin.com makes no use of any credit card or other financial information you may provide.

 **Change of our Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to change this policy at anytime. If at some point in the future, there is a change to our information usage practices that affect your personal information, we will notify you by email of the relevant changes. At the time of this message, you will be able to opt-out of this information usage by sending a message to [Customer Service](mailto:customer_ecare@harlequin.ca). We will also post the changes in our privacy statement 30 days prior to a change. You should also check this posted privacy statement for changes.
