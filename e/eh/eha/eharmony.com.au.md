In this Privacy Policy, we will refer to information that reveals personally identifiable information as "Personal Data" and to information that does not reveal any personally identifiable information about a user as "Anonymous Data".
    5. Non-subscribing visitors to eHarmony are not allowed access to Personal Data or Anonymous Data in any way, other than Anonymous Data displayed as part of a user profile, which is viewable by other users who are matched with that user.
