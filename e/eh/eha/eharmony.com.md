**Information We Collect and How It's Used**

**Questionnaires and Profiles**

**eHarmony** collects a wide variety of information which is used in order to find matches which offer the highest possible chance of a successful long-term relationship or marriage. Except as explicitly provided herein, none of the information collected by **eHarmony** as part of the intake questionnaire used by the matching engine or personality profile is made accessible to the public, other users of the site or anyone not employed by **eHarmony** directly. This information is held strictly confidential and can be deleted at the user's request. Information collected during the intake questionnaire which may be shared with other users of **eHarmony** will be displayed in a strictly anonymous manner with no personally identifying details, and will only be shown to potential match candidates. Non-subscribing visitors to **eHarmony** are not allowed access to this information in any way. 

By using eHarmony.com, you agree to allow us to anonymously use the information from you and your experiences through eHarmony.com to continue our research into successful relationships. This research, conducted by psychologists and behavior research scientists, may be published in academic journals. However, all of your responses will be kept anonymous, and no personal identifying information will ever be published. You can find out more about the standards we follow in conducting scientific research at the following site: [http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.htm.](http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.htm)

**Information Supplied by You at Registration or Purchase**

**eHarmony** offers a subscriber-based service to users seeking partners, as well as offering products related to successful relationships and personal growth for retail sale. To process subscriptions and/or product purchases, we may require your name, billing address, phone number, email address, shipping address and credit card information. Information gathered during product purchases is used primarily to process your order or as otherwise described herein. In general, you will receive one email notification that you have placed an order, and another email notification that your order has been filled. You will be similarly notified of subscription renewal transactions when they occur. Email contact Information provided by you is also used primarily to notify you of potential match candidates identified by **eHarmony** based on your matching criteria and profile. Once you begin **eHarmony's** registration process, we may also occasionally send you newsletters and email you notifications of special events or product offerings at **eHarmony**. If you have started, but not completed, the registration process, we may also send you email messages encouraging you to complete the process and become a subscriber. All of the email messages we send you may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the emails, including whether the email was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. If you would rather not receive emails about new products, promotions or other noteworthy news, please see the section below labeled "Choice/Opt-out". **EHarmony** fully complies with the requirements of the federal CAN-SPAM Act. 

Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. Some of this information (i.e., customer demographic information) may be shared with advertisers on an aggregate, non personally identifiable basis. 

Advertisements, promotions and offers from third-party advertisers may be provided to you while you are visiting the eHarmony web site. If you choose to accept any such offers, eHarmony may provide your information, including billing information, to the advertiser. 

When purchasing an eHarmony subscription, advertisements, promotions and offers from third-party advertisers may be provided to you. If you choose to accept any such offers, eHarmony will provide your information, including billing information, to the advertiser by pre-populating the offer registration forms. Your information will not be transferred until you actually accept the offer. You may opt-out of the offer at any time up until this point. Please refer to the third-party advertisers own privacy policy (provided on the offer pages) if you have any questions regarding how your information is used.

Please be aware that these offers may be presented on pages framed by the eHarmony website. We do this to provide a seamless experience. Although these offer pages have the look and feel of our website, you will be submitting your information directly to the third-party advertiser.

As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets and, depending on the transaction, your personally identifiable information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event that we are acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party. If this occurs, you will be notified if there are any material changes to the way your personally identifiable information is collected or used.

Credit card transactions are processed through industry standard secure socket layer encryption by [a](http://www.cybersource.com/) third party, which only uses your information for that purpose.

We will only share your information with third-parties in the ways defined in this privacy statement.
