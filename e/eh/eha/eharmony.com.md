This statement discloses the privacy practices for the eharmony website. The purpose of this statement is to notify you of what personally identifiable information of yours will be collected by the eharmony site, how it will be used, and what options are available to you regarding the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. Any future changes to our privacy statement will be prominently posted on the website. 

  


**eharmony** collects a wide variety of information which is used in order to find matches which offer the highest possible chance of a successful long-term relationship or marriage. None of the information collected by eharmony as part of the intake questionnaire used by the matching engine or personality profile is made accessible to the public, other users of the site or anyone not employed by eharmony directly. This information is held strictly confidential and can be deleted at the users request. Information collected during the intake questionnaire which may be shared with other users of eharmony will be displayed in a strictly anonymous manner with no personally identifying details, and will only be shown to potential match candidates. Non-subscribing visitors to eharmony are not allowed access to this information in any way. 

If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. 


**eharmony** offers a subscriber-based service to users seeking partners, as well as offering products related to successful relationships and personal growth for retail sale. To process subscriptions and/or product purchases, we may require your name, billing address, phone number, email address, shipping address and credit card information. Information gathered during product purchases is used primarily to process your order. In general, you will receive one email notification that you have placed an order, and another email notification that your order has been filled. You will be similarly notified of subscription renewal transactions when they occur. Email contact Information provided by you is also used primarily to notify you of potential match candidates identified by eharmony based on your matching criteria and profile. We may also occasionally email you notifications of special events or product offerings at eharmony. You may do so at any time. For more information on removing your email address, please see the section labled "Choice/Opt-out".

Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site.

YOUR PERSONAL CONTACT INFORMATION WILL NOT BE LENT OR SOLD TO ANY OTHER BUSINESS OR VENDOR.

Credit card transactions are processed by [CyberSource](http://www.cybersource.com/), which only uses your information for that purpose.

**eharmony** encourages you to refer a friend to our service. In this section you are able to send us a friend's name and email address.
