Collection of personal information. In some cases, we may ask you for personal information. 

  * **Customization:** Some areas of the site can be customized according to user preferences. We use individual preferences to deliver custom content online and analyze aggregate preferences in order to improve site quality.
  * **Publication orders:** If a user orders a publication, their personal information will be used to fulfill the order, and may be shared with third parties involved in fulfilling your order (a printer, for instance).
  * **Event registration:** If a user registers for an event on-line, their personal information will be used to fulfill that request, and may be shared with third parties involved with the event (a hotel, for instance).

  * **Subscriptions:** If you subscribe to one of our online publications, we use the information you provide to send you e-mail updates. You can unsubscribe at any time. 
  * **Surveys:** The information we collect in online surveys is used for internal research purposes. In general, we do not divulge individual responses to surveys except for participant names. Exceptions to this policy are noted when users access particular surveys. Third parties administer some of our surveys, but they cannot use any of the individual data they help collect.



On occasion, we may share responses with a co-sponsor who works with us to analyze the data; in this case, we expect the co-sponsor to maintain the same level of confidentiality with individual responses.

**Third parties.** We do not share or sell the information you provide with parties outside of Watson Wyatt Worldwide, with the following exceptions: to fulfill user requests for publications, for event registrations and for co-sponsored surveys. Any data we collect, however, may be transferred internationally throughout Watson Wyatt Worldwide for internal purposes only.
