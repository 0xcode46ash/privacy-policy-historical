# e2save.com - Mobile Phone Retailer - About Us.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998). 

We collect information about you for 2 reasons: firstly, to process your order and secondly to provide you with the best possible service. 

We will not e-mail you in the future unless you have given us your permission. 

We will give you the chance to refuse any marketing materials in the future. 

The type of information we will collect about you includes: 

  * your name 
  * your age 
  * your address 
  * your previous address if you have resided at your current address for less than three years 
  * your phone number (including mobile and fax if applicable)
  * your email address 
  * your credit/debit card details



We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. 

If you have opted to take out insurance on your mobile phone your details will be sent to Allianz Cornhill (our chosen insurer) in order to process your application. In addition, if you have opted to sign up to talktalk and save up to 30% on your BT landline bill, your information will be forwarded on in order to process your application at Carphone Warehouse. 

The information we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check the information that we hold about you by emailing us. If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly. 

The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and English law. 

If we intend to transfer your information outside the EEA (European Economic Area) we will always obtain your consent first. 

We may use technology to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to our site. This can include using a "cookie" which would be stored on your browser. You can usually modify your browser to prevent this happening but we advise that you leave this option on so we may process your order with greater ease. The information collected in this way can be used to identify you unless you modify your browser settings. 

From time to time calls may be recorded for training purposes. 

If you have any questions/comments about privacy, you should submit a query via our [customer services form](https://web.archive.org/web/20040603115328id_/http%3A//www.e2save.com/customer_services_form.php)
