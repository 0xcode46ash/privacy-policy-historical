### How your personal information is used by e2save.com

When you place an order with e2save.com, we need to collect certain information to be able to process your order. What we need varies depending on the items you have ordered, and the pages you are asked to complete will vary accordingly. The information is sent to us via an SSL encrypted server. This information will form part of a permanent record of your dealings with e2save.com.

When you email us, we may ask for certain information to be able to check this record and answer your questions quickly and accurately. When you contact us, in any way, we may make a note of this contact if it is relevant to your permanent record. This allows us to provide a higher level of ongoing customer care. 

We will keep your personal details, given to us by you or others during your relationship with us and other companies in the Dixons Carphone plc. group of companies. 

These include:

  * __details you give us on application forms or during conversations with you on the telephone or at any of our stores,

We may disclose information about how you run your accounts to the credit reference agencies. We and other organisations may also use credit reference agency and fraud prevention agency records that we receive about you, people financially linked to you and others in your household to help make decisions about you and them.

We may also use your information for research and statistical analysis with the aim of improving our services. When assessing an application, we may use automated decision-making systems.

If you request it, on payment of a fee, which is currently Â£10, we will provide you with a copy of the personal information to which you are entitled that we hold about you.

The information we hold about you is confidential. We will only disclose it outside the Carphone Warehouse Group when:

  * __you give us your consent,
  * __to provide you with other services;
  * __it is needed by certain reputable third parties involved in running accounts and/or providing services for you (for example, credit reference agencies who do credit checks for us),
  * __in order to obtain professional advice,
  *  __we or others need to investigate or prevent crime (e.g. to fraud prevention agencies),
  *  __the law permits or requires it, or any regulatory or governmental body requests or requires it, even without your consent, or,
  *  __to prevent money laundering; and
  *  __there is a duty to the public to reveal the information.



We may administer your account and provide other services from centres in countries outside Europe that do not always have the same standard of data protection laws as the UK. However, we will have a contract in place to ensure that your information is adequately protected, and we will remain bound by our obligations under the Data Protection Act even when your personal information is processed outside Europe.

### Use of cookies **Updated due to EU Cookie Privacy Law - Directive 2009/136/EC**

Cookies are text files which contain information that is transferred to your computer hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. Some of the cookies we use are essential for the site to operate, whereas others are aimed at enhancing and personalising your user experience.

The information gathered by cookies on our site may be used in the following ways;

To tailor advertisements or promotions you receive. For example, if you have looked at a specific type of mobile handset, we might use this information to personalise any subsequent advertisements you see. We may also personalise our service based on the type of computer system you use, together with the purchase pattern of other customers who may have looked at similar products to you. We may also provide you with advertisements which may be customised using information such as the search terms you use on our site. For example, if you searched for a specific product or accessed our site via a specific banner ad or search word, we may present you with content and/or offers linked to that banner ad or search word.

We may use navigational information about where you go on our site to better understand how our site is used and to ensure that the product offerings that are presented to you are relevant.

We do not use any data about where you go, or present you with advertisements outside of our site other than on sites which provide for such use in their respective privacy policies.

We may collect information on how frequently you visit the site and the type of products and/or services that you view to enable us to measure the popularity of our sites and our product offerings. 

### Types of Cookie

**

Category 1: Strictly Necessary Cookies

**

These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website, remembering how far you are through your pay as you go order, making sure that the e2save.com website looks consistent or remembering what's in your basket when you're looking to buy that new cool smartphone. Without these cookies, many of the basic functionalities of our website - the stuff you expect the site to enable you to do like filling in your shopping basket, we simply can't provide.

Tip - these cookies make the basic functions of the website work.

**

Category 2: Performance Cookies

**

These cookies collect information about how visitors use our website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and the pages that they don't. This understanding enables e2save to continually improve the experience we deliver to you (and other visitors like you) so that the site is easy to use and includes content that you find helpful (for instance, performance cookies indicated that users find reviews really helpful and so that gave us confidence that we should provide more reviews on each smartphone product page) These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor - so we can't identify you individually. All the information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. This information is only used to improve how the e2save website works.

Tip - these cookies collect anonymous information on the pages visited.

**

Category 3: Functionality Cookies

**

These cookies allow the website to remember the choices you make as you browse the site (for instance, your login details to enable you to provide your comments in our new community forums). They provide more enhanced and personal features. The information they collect is anonymised and the usage only relates to www.e2save.com - they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites once you've departed e2save.com

Tip - these cookies remember choices you have made to improve your website experience on www.e2save.com

**

Category 4: Advertising or Targeting Cookies

**

These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you, and your interests (assumed by analysing your onsite browsing behaviour). They can also provide caps on the number of times you might see an advert - to hopefully stop them becoming annoying and repetitive. These cookies remember that you have visited e2save.com, track what products you may have looked at, and this information may be shared with our advertising partners. If you see an advert from e2save, once you have left our site and are browsing other sites on the internet, that magically seems to understand what previously interested you (you browsed a specific smartphone handset and then see deals for that handset) then this is enabled by targeting cookies. 

Tip - these cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising more relevant for you.

By using this site, you agree to our use of cookies in the manner outlined above. If you do not wish to receive tailored advertising, you can withdraw this consent at any time by changing your browser settings to reject cookies. 

Please note that it is not a good idea to reject all cookies as this could prevent you from gaining full use of this site. To learn more about cookies click here, or to disable them click here.

### Accurate Information

We may check what you have told us and share that information with fraud prevention agencies. It is important that you give us accurate information. If you give us false or inaccurate data and we suspect fraud we will record this at the fraud prevention agencies.

You are responsible for informing us that your personal details have changed: for example, a change of address or to your title. You confirm that you will inform us of any change to your personal information as soon as is reasonably practicable in order that we may update our records.
