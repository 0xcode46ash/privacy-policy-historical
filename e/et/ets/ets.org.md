# ETS Net Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

Educational Testing Service provides visitors to our Web site with as much control as possible over their non-public personal information.

When you visit any of our Web pages, we use standard Web server log files to evaluate our site's technical capability. We use this information to find out how many people visit _ets.org_ , to determine the areas of greatest interest on our site, and to make improvements to our site. We record information on site traffic but not information on individual visitors to our site, so no information about you in particular will be kept or used.

The _ets.org_ Web site only collects personal information that you choose to provide **voluntarily** when using our site, including survey information and/or site registrations, online test registration information, or online order information. "Personal information" includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name or email address. We never sell or rent your personal information to any third parties under any circumstances.

If you supply us with your telephone number online, you may receive telephone contact from us.

## Security Policy

All secure transactions processed on _ets.org_ utilize Netscape's Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. SSL encrypts the transmission of data to and from our server and your computer. If you are using Netscape or Internet Explorer version 1.0 or higher, your transactions are fully encrypted and secure. You'll know that they are secure when you see a full yellow key in a blue box in the lower left-hand corner of your Netscape browser or a full "lock" in the status bar of your Internet Explorer browser.

ETS has contracted with Digital River to host our [online store](https://web.archive.org/web/20040623104553id_/http%3A//www.ets.org/store.html). Digital River uses its own Secure Sales Server technology (S3) along with Netscape's SSL encryption technology on every order transaction. For more detailed information on store security, please go to <http://drhome.digitalriver.com/livehtml/newsite/dr_privacy_000.html>.

If you have any questions or comments about our privacy or security policies, you may contact us at [webmaster@ets.org.](mailto:webmaster@ets.org)
