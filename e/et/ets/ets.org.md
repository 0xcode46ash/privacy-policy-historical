Educational Testing Service respects your privacy. This privacy policy governs our collection and use of personal information about you on the ETS website at [www.ets.org](https://web.archive.org/vgn-ext-templating/v/?vgnextoid=85b65784623f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD). "Personal information" includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name or email address. Personal data does not include anonymized aggregate or statistical information from which such identification can be reconstituted.

### Information We Collect

When you visit any page on our Web site, we use standard Web server log files to monitor and evaluate our site's technical capability and performance. We use this information to find out how many people visit [ets.org](https://web.archive.org/vgn-ext-templating/v/?vgnextoid=85b65784623f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD), to determine the areas of greatest interest on our site, and to make improvements to our site.

We also collect and store personal information that you provide voluntarily when using our site, including, for example,

  * Survey information and/or site registrations

  * Online order information
  * Payment information



If you register for a test, create an online account, or request one of our other services, we collect your

  * Full name

  * Telephone number
  * The test you are registering for
  * Test date
  * Payment information
  * How you specifically use our site



Depending on how you use the site, your test results may also be accessed through the site.

### How We Use Your Personal Information

We use your personal information to

  * Complete any registration, purchases, or other transactions you request online
  * Improve our Web site
  * Improve our products and services, and identify, develop, and offer products and services that may be of interest to our visitor
  * Personalize your experience on the site, and customize the content and/or format of the pages you visit
  * Notify you about updates, products, services, and/or special offers from ETS, its affiliates, and selected third parties
  * Ask you to participate in brief surveys
  * Generate aggregate statistical studies and conduct research related to our products and services and the use of our Web site



### Disclosure of Your Personal Information

We disclose your personal information to certain third parties to provide the products and services you have requested online. For example, when you register for a test, we will provide certain registration information to companies that administer the tests in your area. When you request other services, we will provide your personal data to third-party companies with whom we arrange for those services to be provided. We may also disclose information to third parties that provide administrative or processing services for us, for example, printing, mailing, and payment processing. Our contract with these third parties prohibits them from using information except to provide the product or service you requested. If you ask us to, we will disclose your test scores to schools and others.

We may also disclose personal information collected on the website, in accordance with applicable law, to assert or defend our rights and property, to prevent harm to others, to collect a debt, or in response to legal processes such as subpoenas.

If you have expressly consented to our doing so, we may also share your personal data with third parties in order that they may offer you information about their goods and services.

### Choices

When you register for a test online or create an account, you will have the ability to opt-out of receiving certain communications from ETS, including voicemail or e-mail. If you do not opt out at registration, but later decide that you would prefer not to receive this communication, please contact us at [webmaster@ets.org](mailto:webmaster@ets.org). Remember, however, that ETS may still send e-mail or call you in order to provide a product or service that you request.

### Links to Other Sites

The [ets.org](https://web.archive.org/vgn-ext-templating/v/?vgnextoid=85b65784623f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD) website may contain links to other sites. ETS does not control the privacy policies or practices of these websites. You should review those policies before providing any information. ETS is not responsible for the content or practices of any linked websites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.

### Cookies/Non-Personal Information

When you visit and interact with our website, ETS and third parties with whom ETS has contracted to provide services to ETS, may collect non-personal information (for example, a catalog of the site pages you visit, or your IP address).

As with many other sites, our site may use "cookies" or other technologies to help us deliver content specific to your interests, to process your reservations or requests, and/or to analyze your visiting patterns. Cookies, by themselves, will not be used by ETS to disclose your individual identity. This information identifies your browser, but not you, to our servers when you visit our website. If you want to disable the use of cookies or remove them at any time from your computer, you can disable or delete them using your browser (consult your browser's "help" menu to learn how to delete cookies), however you must enable cookies to access certain information on our website. Note that in limited instances, such as when you register for a test or create an online account, cookies may contain and be associated with the personally identifiable information we collect.

We may also collect data by using "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "pixel tags") that allow us to know when you visit our site. Through pixel tags, we obtain non-personal information or aggregate information (i.e., your IP address, the areas of the site you visit, your operating system, your browser version and the URL you came from) which can be used to enhance your online experience and understand traffic patterns.

In addition, we may use third-party advertisers to serve or track advertisements on websites. Please note that these third parties also may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to, among other things, enable such third parties to record which ads your browser has loaded and which site pages you may have been viewing when the ads were delivered or accessed. Use of such third-party sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of those third parties. ETS does not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. One of the third parties used by ETS to serve or track advertisements is DoubleClick. For more information about DoubleClick, the cookies it uses and how to opt out, please go to [http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/).

Because non-personal information does not personally identify you, we may use or disclose such information for any purpose. In some instances, we may combine non-personal information with personal information (such as embedding e-mail addresses in cookies). If we do combine any non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information in accordance with this Policy.

### Security

ETS has established safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of your personal information, but cannot guarantee that your personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (for example, as a result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable law or relevant Web policies).

If you register for a Web account, you will be asked to select a password to help protect your information. These passwords help us verify your identity before granting access or making corrections to any of your personal information. You should never disclose your password to anyone. ETS will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.

When you provide credit card information, it is transmitted using SSL technology to help prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of that information. You'll know that SSL is being used when you see a full yellow key in a blue box in the lower left-hand corner of your Netscape browser or a full "lock" in the status bar of your Internet Explorer browser.

ETS has contracted with Digital River to host our [online store](https://web.archive.org/vgn-ext-templating/v/?vgnextoid=210ce3b5f64f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD). Digital River uses its own Secure Sales Server technology (S3) along with Netscape's SSL encryption technology on every order transaction.

ETS may change this policy to respond to new laws, regulations, technology, or for other business reasons. Please check this site from time to time to review any such changes.
