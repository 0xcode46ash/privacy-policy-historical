# Privacy Policy - Highlights - Etsy Help

We love our community at Etsy. You’ve trusted us with a big responsibility, and we’re committed to upholding a high standard when it comes to our privacy practices.

We use secure technologies and follow best practices, as evidenced by TRUSTe's Privacy Seal, recognized and trusted by millions of consumers as a sign of responsible privacy practices. We believe in being transparent about our practices, which is why we provide a detailed [Privacy Policy](http://www.etsy.com/help/article/1262) to explain how we gather, use and protect your information. We’ve pulled out the highlights here, in an effort to better communicate the key points.
