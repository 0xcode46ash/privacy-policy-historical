# EtherPad: Privacy Policy

**I. Pad Text**

When you type into an EtherPad document, the edits are transmitted through our servers, which process them according to our patent-pending edit synchronization algorithm. The entire change history of pads are stored in our servers' database. 

We go to great lengths to secure these data. Our servers reside in professionally managed data centers, and we have an expert staff of system administrators who secure our systems from outside attacks. 

Note that in the free version of EtherPad, all pad text is publicly available via the pad's URL. When you create a new pad, the URL is generated randomly. This provides some security because these URLs are not guessable, so as long as you are careful about who you share them with, unwanted visitors will not access your pad. 

We will not publish indices of pad URLs, link to, or direct any traffic to pads or published pad revisions. Nor will we publish the contents of anyone's pads in any public domain. Furthermore, we the engineers and operators of etherpad.com, promise to not even _look_ at the contents of your pads unless we absolutely need to in order to debug a critical systems error. 

We may publish aggregate statistics about pads in general. For example, we may compute the average words-per-minute that people type across all pads and publish that average. Or we may analyze pad texts for the most commonly misspelled words. Whenever we do aggregate analysis like this, we will never disclose specific information about any given pads or authors.
