### Verified by Visa

Ethicalsuperstore.com is now participating in **Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode** for added online payment security. These services are offered by Visa and MasterCard, in association with the bank that has issued your credit or debit card. It is aimed at protecting your details when shopping online by ensuring your card is not being used by someone else and is becoming a standard across all shopping websites.

If the credit or debit card you're using to pay for your order qualifies for one of these services (not all cards do), you will be taken to a page hosted by your card issuer. This is a completely secure process. The information you provide is completely private, will only be visible to you and your card issuer, and would never be shared with other parties.

If you haven't registered before and your card qualifies, you will need to follow the on-screen instructions to register securely and create a password for your card. This is not the same as the PIN number you use for your regular shopping. It's an online shopping code that you'll be able to use to identify yourself and your card when shopping online on Ethicalsuperstore.com or any other participating websites. It's the online equivalent of chip and pin which is used on the High Street. Once registered, you will be taken back to Ethicalsuperstore.com to confirm your order. If you're unsure about this new service, you may be able to complete your order without registering but we recommend that you contact your card issuer to find out more about the service, as they will eventually require you to register to continue shopping online. 

If you have already registered, you will be required to use your password on future online transactions.

If you would like to learn more about these services or have any difficulty with the process, please contact your card issuer who should be able to assist you, as Ethicalsuperstore.com are unfortunately not able to help. Alternatively, you can always place your order by calling our Customer service team.

### Security

We take the security of your personal information very seriously. We want you to know that you are shopping in a safe and secure environment and that you are in control over what happens to your information.

  * **Secure data transfer** – We use a GeoTrust secure certificate to encrypt all of your personal data when it is sent to and from the internet. This means that information you to send to us can only be seen by us and vice versa.
  * **Using your data** – we use your data solely for the purposes of your customer relationship with us. We do NOT rent our list of customers to third parties. We will only communicate with you in ways which you have control over. You can change your communication settings at any time in your account. You can opt for email and mail, mail only, email only or no marketing communications at all. We will only use your phone number to contact you if we have an urgent enquiry regarding a specific order.
  * **Your credit and debit card details** – These are not stored on our system and our staff can only see the first four and last digits of your card. Your details are held by our bank and they are fully compliant with the PCI Credit Card Security standard. If you phone or post through your credit card details, we will not hold those on file and any record will be securely shredded after the transaction is complete.
  * **3D Secure** – This is a new standard for credit security and we are already fully compliant. This standard allows you to set a password or pin number that you will always be asked for when you use your card. That way even if your card goes missing, no one will be able to successfully use it on fraudulent transactions.
