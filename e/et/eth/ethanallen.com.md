# Privacy Policy

Ethanallen.com understands and respects your concerns about privacy and is committed to providing you with a safe online experience. The information below describes the type of information we collect, how it is used, and steps we take to protect your personally identifiable information. This policy applies only to website or phone orders and does not necessarily apply to our retail locations. Periodically, we may update our Privacy and Security policies and encourage you to check this section for any changes. 

## How does ethanallen.com protect customer credit card information?

We use a secure server that uses secure socket layer software to encrypt all your personal information before it is sent to us to prevent unauthorized access to your information. 

We further have a policy for employees to safeguard client information designed to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or use in any way.

Any visitors who do not want their personal information collected online are offered the opportunity to not submit such information to ethanallen.com. We also offer the option for you to place your order by telephone or fax. Call us at 888-EA-HELP1 (888-324-3571) and we will be glad to assist you.

## What personally identifiable information does ethanallen.com collect and how is it used?

We collect only the client information that is needed to administer our business, provide superior service to our clients, and communicate information relating to our products and services that we believe to be of interest to our clients.

This website collects personally identifiable information (such as name, address, telephone and fax numbers, e-mail address, credit card and purchase information, and possibly the identity of Ethan Allen Design Centers where you have shopped and of design consultants with whom you may have shopped) from visitors only when such information is voluntarily provided. That information is used to process your purchases and requests and to provide service. Information about your shopping cart choices, purchases, or requests for design assistance may be passed along to the closest Ethan Allen Design Center. Our retail network is made up of Design Centers run by independently owned and authorized Ethan Allen retailers and Design Centers owned and operated by Ethan Allen Global, Inc. Credit card and financing information also may be provided to credit card and consumer financing companies as is required to process applications and transactions.

Information supplied to us is added to our client database. We make portions of our web and phone order client list available to carefully chosen companies. If you do not want your name made available this way, if you’ve moved, or if you would prefer not to receive our catalogs, call 1-888-EA-HELP1 (1-888-324-3571) and then select option 1 to speak with a Client Services representative. If you no longer wish to receive our digital communications, please click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our emails.

Information further may be stored and used to better understand our clients, their needs, ways to improve our products and services, and to contact clients with offers that may be of interest to them. 

## What other information does ethanallen.com collect and how is it used?

This website also may collect information from visitors that could include data about your operating system, domain name, browser, and even the specific web pages on our website that you access or visit. We collect information in the aggregate—on an anonymous basis—and may use it to evaluate the ease of use and convenience of our website and to make further improvements. 

## What is the privacy policy for children?

We understand that parents are interested in supervising their children’s online activities. To support that objective, we have designed this website so that it does not ask for or collect personally identifiable information (name, address, telephone for fax numbers or e-mail addresses) from children (individuals under the age of 13) online and use that information for marketing purposes. If we discover that a child under the age of 13 submitted information to us, we will not use it for any purpose and will delete the information from our database.

## What are “cookies” and how are they used?

A “cookie” is a small amount of data sent to your browser from a website server that may be stored on your computer’s hard drive. When you visit our website, this site may store a “cookie” or similar file on your computer. This information may be used for general purposes such as providing you with more personalized service, storing your zip code, and even helping us track our website visits and traffic patterns.

Most Internet browsers allow users to exercise control over such files on their computers by blocking them, erasing them, or possibly notifying users when such a file is stored. We encourage you to refer to your Internet browser’s instructions to learn about those functions and options. 

## How may I stop the use of my personally identifiable information?

Our website provides the information on how to be removed from mailing lists or to otherwise prevent the use in the future of your personally identifiable information. If you do not want your name made available this way, if you’ve moved, or if you would prefer not to receive our catalogs, call 1-888-EA-HELP1 (1-888-324-3571) and then select option 1 to speak with a Client Services representative. If you no longer wish to receive our digital communications, please click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our emails.

## Under what circumstances is personal information turned over to law enforcement agencies?

Any stored information that becomes subject to a subpoena, court order, or other request by any local, state, or federal agency will be provided to the requesting agency as deemed necessary by Ethan Allen.
