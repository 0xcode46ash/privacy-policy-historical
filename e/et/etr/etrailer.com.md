Simply [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20130602135624id_/http%3A//contact.aspx). Include your order number and a link to the website where you have found the lower priced in-stock item. We will issue a credit to the card that was used for your purchase for 110% of the difference in the delivered price.

You must order from etrailer.com in order to qualify for the price match. Also, the request must be within 30 days of order.

It is that easy.

Thanks for being an etrailer.com customer and allowing us to offer the lowest prices.

It is not just a pledge. It's a promise.â„¢
