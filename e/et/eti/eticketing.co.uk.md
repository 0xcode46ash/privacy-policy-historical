You may be asked for further information if we run surveys, competitions, prize draws and other promotional activities. If this is the case, then this Privacy Policy will apply to the personal information you provide, but please check for any specific terms that apply each time you participate in these activities.

### Information Which We Obtain

We may also add information to your details, which we have obtained from other companies or sources. For example, we may cross check the accuracy of the information we hold with other databases, or we may add demographic information. Much of this data is created using publicly available sources such as the edited electoral register or the Postal Address File, or is derived from market research such as consumer panel surveys. 

### How We Use Personal Information

**Our Event Partners**

As an authorised ticket agent, Ticketmaster sells tickets on behalf the providers of the live events for which you buy tickets. This might be an artist, venue, promoter, fan club, sports club or organisation, producer or sponsor. We refer to the organisers or providers of an event as our "Event Partners". When you purchase tickets for an event, we share your personal information with our Event Partner, but only if you have bought tickets for the events that they are providing. There may be more than one Event Partner for each event.

Ticketmaster is data controller in respect of all of the information which Ticketmaster collects and receives about you when you use our services. The Event Partner (in common with Ticketmaster) is a data controller of the information which relates to their events.

### Providing, Improving and Customising Our Services

We use your information primarily to provide you with the services and products you request, and related customer services (this includes providing this Site, website administration and security).

We also analyse this information to improve our understanding of you and our customer base in general. We do this so that we can make better decisions about our services, advertising, products and content, based on a more informed picture of how our customers use our current services, and to provide you with a more customised experience.

Depending on your marketing preferences, we may use this information to help us to determine which offers, information, discounts and promotions you would most like to receive.

**Direct Marketing**

When you first register with the Site, you can decide whether your contact information may be used by us, our Event Partners and selected third parties for direct marketing purposes. Depending on your selection, Ticketmaster, its group companies, Event Partners and/or other third parties may contact you by e-mail or post with information or offers regarding their goods and services such as discounts, exclusive offers or special event information.

Unless you opt-out, Ticketmaster will send you a weekly TicketAlert with information about upcoming shows and events. If you purchase a ticket for an event, your address will be entered into Ticketmaster's PerformerAlert service. This service sends you e-mail updates when the same artist, event or festival announces new dates in the future.

You will be given an opportunity to unsubscribe in every marketing e-mail we send you.

**Changing your Marketing Preferences**

If you change your mind or want to amend your marketing preferences, you can do so at any time from your [MyTicketmaster](https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/member/edit_subscriptions?tm_link=mytm_SignIn) account.

Sign up: new events often sell out fast, so a [MyTicketmaster](https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/member/edit_subscriptions?tm_link=mytm_SignIn) account lets you set up alerts for your favourite artists, festivals, bands, teams, venues and other events to make sure you never miss out on an opportunity to buy tickets when they go on sale through Ticketmaster.
