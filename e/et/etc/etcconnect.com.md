**Information We Collect About You**

Here is the information we do collect and how we use it:

_Activity Information._ When you access and interact with the Site, we may collect certain information about those visits. For example, our servers may receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Site from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other transactional information for that device.

_Personally Identifiable Information_   
In this Privacy Policy, “personally identifiable information” means information that identifies a particular individual, including but not limited to an individual’s name, postal address, e-mail address, and phone number. Personally identifiable information does not include screen names or user names that you may provide to us or through this Site. The following are some situations in which we may collect personally identifiable information from you::

  * When you fill out forms or fields on this Site;
  * When you communicate with us or request information about us, this Site and our services, whether via email or other electronic means;
  * When you sign up for ETC website membership; 
  * When you participate in any of our marketing initiatives, including, contests, events, or promotions; 
  * When you participate in online surveys; and
  * When you participate in forums or provide user generated content or submissions.



ETC website membership is an added feature of this Site and is not required to access this Site. You can browse the public sections of this Site without providing ETC with any information. However, membership allows you to customize your experience on the Site and access information for your type of membership.

From time to time, ETC administers online surveys to solicit your opinion on our website content, structure and user experience. We use the information you provide in these surveys to improve our website. Within the survey itself, we will let you know exactly how we will use the information we collect.

_Non-Personally Identifiable Information_   
We may collect demographic information about you including but not limited to gender, IP address, zip code, and birth date, and information regarding your preferences and usage. This type of information is not, by itself, personally identifiable information. However, if we link such information with personally identifiable information in a manner that identifies a particular individual, then we will treat all such information as personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy. 

We may collect non-personally identifiable information about you through a variety of technical methods, including the following: 

  * _Collection of Usage Details and IP Address._ As you navigate through this Site, we may collect details of your visits to this Site, including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, logs, the resources that you access, and information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system and browser type. We may use this information for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and business partners.
  * _Collection with Cookies_. "Cookies" are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing a website. We may set and access cookies on your computer to track and store preferential information about you. You consent to our placement of cookies on your computer. Please note that most Internet browsers will allow you to stop cookies from being stored on your computer and to delete cookies stored on your computer. If you choose to do so, however, your use of certain aspects of this Site may be restricted. 
  * _Collection with Web beacons_. “Web beacons” are electronic images, tags or scripts that allow a website to access cookies and help track general usage patterns of visitors to a website. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information, such as cookies, time and date of a page view and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. We may use Web beacons to compile information regarding use of this Site.
  * _Collection with Mobile Device GPS_. If you are using a mobile device application to access or use the Site, we may use the GPS of the mobile device to identify your location. Any such identification is used only in connection with the functionality of the Site and will not be otherwise used, except in the aggregate with the location information from other users.



The information collected through these technical methods, standing alone, cannot be used to determine your identity. Such information may, however, be combined in a way that makes it become personally identifiable information. If this happens, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information.

_Financial Information  
_We do not collect any financial information on this Site. If you make a debit or credit card payment online, you will be taken to a secure payment service provider who will take your payment on our behalf. You should not communicate credit card or other payment information via email, as it is not secure.

**Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information**

_Typical Disclosure_

We may disclose personally identifiable information:

  * To any person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive your personally identifiable information as your agent, including as a result of your business dealings with that person (for example, your attorney);
  * To our third party vendors so that they may provide support for our internal and business operations, including for the handling of data processing, data storage, surveys, research, internal marketing, delivery of promotional and transaction materials, and this Site’s maintenance and security;
  * To third parties when you (i) engage in any activities on this Site that are sponsored by them, such as purchasing products or services offered by a third party, electing to receive information or communications from a third party, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored in whole or in part by a third party, and/or (ii) respond to promotional materials from us and you authorize a third party to use your personally identifiable information to, for example, send you additional promotional materials, provide you a product or service, or enter you into a sweepstakes. When we disclose your personally identifiable information to these third parties, your personally identifiable information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your personally identifiable information;
  * As required by law or ordered by a court, regulatory, or administrative agency;
  * As we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, if we believe that you are violating any applicable law, rule or regulation, or are otherwise interfering with another’s rights or property, including, without limitation, our rights or property;
  * If requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of local, regional or national emergency;
  * To monitor compliance with and enforce our Terms of Use http://www.etcconnect.com/Privacy-Policy-and-terms-of-use.aspx, this Privacy Policy, and any other applicable agreements and policies;
  * To enforce or protect our rights;
  * In connection with a Business Transfer, as defined below (see _Business Transfers_ below); and
  * To our affiliated companies (i.e., companies under common control or management with us). 



_Aggregation and De-Personalization_

We may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). We may use and/or disclose to third parties such aggregate or de-personalized information in any manner and without notice or compensation to you.

_Circumvention of Security Measures_

In addition, although we use reasonable security measures to protect the personally identifiable information we collect through this Site, we cannot ensure that your personally identifiable information will only be disclosed as described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personally identifiable information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary within this Privacy Policy, the Terms or any other applicable agreement or policy, _you use this Site at your own risk_ and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information will always remain private. In the unlikely event that an unauthorized third party compromises our security measures, we will not be responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized third party’s ability to view, use or disseminate such information.

_Business Transfers_

We specifically and expressly reserve the right to disclose, lease, sell, assign or transfer your personally identifiable information collected through this Site, and any of its databases, together with any personally identifiable information contained in such data bases, to third parties in connection with a Business Transfer. A “Business Transfer” means a sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, bankruptcy or other corporate change involving us and/or our affiliates, even if the Business Transfer is only being contemplated and regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part or a whole of our business. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our business, equity, and/or assets (including this Site) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation, without notice, any without any compensation to you, whatsoever.

**Network Advertising**

From time to time, we may participate in or use advertising networks, such as third party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms. We may use these third-party advertising networks for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you. Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumer’s interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer’s specific interests. This practice is often referred to as “online behavioral advertising.” For example, a third-party advertising network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or not you visit specific pages of this Site and other websites, the location of your Internet service provider’s presence, the date and time of a visit to a website and other interactions between you and website. Please see the “Online Behavioral Advertising” subsection of _Choices About How We Use and Collect Your Information_ below to read about how you can prevent certain third-party advertising networks from collecting information about you.

**User Generated Content**

You are responsible for any content, including personal information, that you contribute to be published or displayed (“posted”) on this Site, or that you transmit to other users of this Site (collectively, “User Generated Content”). Your User Generated Content is posted on and transmitted to other users of this Site at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of this Site with whom you may choose to share your User Generated Content. We can also not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on this Site. As a result, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Generated Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your User Generated Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other Site users. Proper access and use of information provided on this Site, including User Generated Content, is governed by our Terms of Use <http://www.etcconnect.com/Privacy-Policy-and-terms-of-use.aspx.>
