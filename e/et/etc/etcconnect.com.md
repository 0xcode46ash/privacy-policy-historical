# Privacy Policy | ETC

#### What you need to know

ETC respects the privacy of all visitors to our website. You control whatever personal information you wish to give us. You do not have to tell us who you are or reveal anything further about yourself.

Here is the information we do collect and how we use it:

  * Our Web server collects your domain name. We do not collect your email address. We use the domain name to measure the use of our website's content.
  * Any membership or personalization forms that you fill out via our website to interact with our various business departments (to request product literature, place an order, track an order, or otherwise correspond with an ETC individual) may request personal information such as your email address, telephone number, and specific product/materials or interests.
  * ETC website membership is an added feature of our website and is not required. You can browse the public sections of our website without providing ETC with any information. However, membership allows you to customize your experience on our site and access information for your type of membership.



## Cookies & Surveys

We use this information simply to conduct business with you. At no time do we sell or share your information outside ETC.

  * Some of our pages may use "cookies"- data that a website can send to your browser, which in turn is stored on your computer system. This allows our website to recognize you and provide custom information whenever and wherever appropriate. You can configure your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or you can instruct your browser to refuse cookies altogether.
  * From time to time, ETC administers online surveys to solicit your opinion on our website content, structure and user experience. We use the information you provide in these surveys to improve our website. Within the survey itself, we will let you know exactly how we will use the information we collect.



## External Links

Note that our website contains links to non-ETC websites. Although ETC tries to link only to websites that share our respect for customer information privacy, we can not be responsible for their content or their chosen privacy policies.

If you have any questions or concerns about ETCâ€™s web-privacy policy, please write to us at [webmaster@etcconnect.com](mailto:webmaster@etcconnect.com)
