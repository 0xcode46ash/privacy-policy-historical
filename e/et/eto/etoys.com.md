|  |  **Our Pledge to You, Our Customer**

eToys respects your privacy. We do not sell, rent, loan or transfer any personal information regarding our customers or their kids to any unrelated third parties. Any information you give us about yourself or your kids is held with the utmost care and security and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented.

Information collected on our Web site is collected and used by eToys, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("eToys") and, in limited cases, eToys service providers who are subject to confidentiality agreements. eToys will not collect any personal information about adults except when specifically and knowingly provided by them. eToys generally does not collect personally identifiable information about kids. If we collect any personally identifiable information about kids, we will first obtain their parents' consent. We request that our customers do not provide any information regarding any child without first obtaining their parents' consent. Examples of personally identifiable information include full name, home address, e-mail address, and phone number.

**Use of Information**

Information collected by eToys is used by us for three main purposes. First, we collect information to figure out how to improve our site by seeing which areas, features and products are most popular. Second, we collect information in order to personalize the site for our customers and their kids. For example, in the future, we may recommend products or features you may like based on what you have liked in the past. Last, we collect information to enable customers and their kids to conduct transactions on our Web site and to participate in sweepstakes, contests and other activities. If we collect any such information from a child, we will only collect enough information to enable the child to participate in the activity and no more. If we want to collect information for other purposes, we will inform you when we collect the information.

From time to time, we may use a limited number of service providers to assist us with customer service, such as answering telephone calls and e-mails. These service providers only use customer information to assist our customers. They must keep all customer information strictly confidential and return it to eToys when our agreements with them end. Thus, the information collected by these service providers is controlled by eToys and will only be used for the purposes described in this policy.

On occasion, eToys may also share nonpersonal, summary information regarding our customers with unrelated third parties (for example, we publicly disclose the aggregate number of registered users of our Web site). However, eToys does not share any personal information about any particular customer with unrelated third parties.

**Parental Consent for Kids' Information**

eToys will not collect personally identifiable information about kids without first obtaining their parents' consent. After giving consent, parents will also have the option to review, change or delete a child's personally identifiable information, revoke the consent and refuse to permit collection of further information.

**Cookies**

eToys uses a feature of your Internet Web browser called a "cookie" to assign a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. We use these cookie files to track your clicks as you go through the eToys Web site, to keep track of items you put into your shopping cart, to tell us whether you have visited eToys previously, and to help us determine whether you came to eToys from a particular Internet link or banner advertisement.

Cookies can also be used to help save and retrieve passwords used on the eToys site and to save information on past purchases and other preferences. That way, you won't have to reenter information upon every new visit to the eToys Web site. eToys does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer.

**Security**

At eToys, part of our job is to make sure your shopping experience is safe and secure. That means your credit card is safe, your personal information is safe, and your password is safe. We use the latest encryption technologies, rigorous password protections, and stringent limits on the number of people who have access to your information, all to guard against unauthorized access to the data.
