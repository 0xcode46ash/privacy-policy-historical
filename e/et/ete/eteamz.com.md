# eteamz: Privacy Policy

[Click here to review the Children's Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/company/privacy/children/)   
eteamz is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. We have posted this privacy policy to help you understand how your personal information will be treated as you use and enjoy our web Site. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.

_Collection of Information_

As you navigate the Site, eteamz or its affiliates may be collecting or tracking personal information, either by asking you to tell us something about yourself (for example, when you input your name, address, and email address during the registration process), or by using data-tracking software that tells us what advertisements or parts of the Site have been of interest to you. Information about your activities may also be collected on an aggregate (i.e., group) basis, where we will not know or keep track of precisely who you are. eteamz or its affiliates may use this information, personal and aggregate, to tell you and other users about products or services that may be of interest to you; this information may also be shared with other parties from whom we believe you may want to receive information. Personal information may also be used to contact you again, either by electronic communication (such as email) or by regular mail or telephone. The more information you volunteer, the better we can create a personalized experience at eteamz and tailor our services to your needs.

Please be aware that advertisements displayed on the eteamz Site or third party web sites which are linked from the eteamz Site may also collect information about you. The information practices of those advertisers and web sites often are outside of our control and are not covered by this privacy policy.

_Cookies_

As part of our ongoing effort to personalize our Site and our services, eteamz uses cookies to store and retrieve information about you and your usage of the Site. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from our Site and stored on your computerâ€™s hard drive.

Cookies are also used to help ensure the overall accuracy of the data collection and analysis processes described above.
