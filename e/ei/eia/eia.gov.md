## Privacy Statement and Security Policy

### Privacy Statement

This website ([http://www.eia.gov/](http://www.eia.doe.gov/)) is provided as a public energy information service of the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 

If you visit this site to read or download information, you should know that EIA collects and stores a standard set of Internet-related information, such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address, the date and time, the type of browser and operating system used, the page(s) visited, and if you linked to the EIA website from another website, the address of that website. All information is collected to help EIA make this site more useful to our customers and is only used for statistical purposes.

#### If You Send Us Personal Information and/or Subscribe to EIA's E-Mail Notification System (E-lists)

If you choose to provide us with personal information such as through our "User Feedback" or in an e-mail to the National Energy Information Center, the Webmaster, or to an EIA staff person, or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it to us through our website, we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you have requested. We do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to you. EIA does not give, sell, or transfer personal information to third parties, unless required by law, such as the Freedom of Information Act.

**If You Participate in EIA's Social Media Activities**  
EIA is committed to expanding access to its information and engaging its customers and stakeholders.  One of the key ways we seek to accomplish this is through the use of third-party social media websites and applications. We do not collect or request personally identifiable information through these outlets, but may occasionally come into contact with unsolicited PII due to circumstances beyond our control. As a result, we reserve the right to moderate or remove comments that offer personally identifiable information such as address, phone number or social security number in a public manner. No PII will be retained in our system or shared with outside parties.

#### Security, Intrusion, and Detection

For site security purposes, and to ensure this service remains available to all users, this Government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

#### Operations Security Program

The U.S. Energy Information Administration maintains a program (Operations Security [OPSEC]) that is designed to protect information collected in EIA's surveys. This Program takes the form of various elements such as: staff security training, pre-hire certification, and integrity of EIA data systems, fair practice data disclosure policies, and the physical security of all sensitive unclassified EIA data. If you have any questions concerning this program, please contact Paul Staller, phone (202) 586-6543.

#### Links to Other Sites

Our website has links to many other websites including government (Federal, State, local, and international) agencies, universities, trade associations, energy companies, and selected other websites. Once you link to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.

### Security Policy

This website is part of a Federal computer system used to accomplish Federal functions. The Department of Energy monitors this website for security purposes to ensure it remains available to all users and to protect information in the system. By accessing this website, you are expressly consenting to these monitoring activities. 

Unauthorized attempts to defeat or circumvent security features, to use the system for other than intended purposes, to deny service to authorized users, to access, obtain, alter, damage, or destroy information, or otherwise to interfere with the system or its operation is prohibited. Evidence of such acts may be disclosed to law enforcement authorities and result in criminal prosecution under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-294), (18 U.S.C. 1030), or other applicable criminal laws.

#### Automated Retrieval Program (Robot) Activity

EIA is committed to provide data promptly and according to established schedules, therefore any automated retrieval program (commonly referred to as a “robot” or "bot") that excessively accesses information from EIA’s website is prohibited. Excessive robot activity on EIA’s website can cause delays and interfere with other customers' timely access to information. 

EIA will block robots that are accessing the website in any way that EIA considers excessive or malicious, including robots that attempt to access or download survey information multiple times per second with resulting degradation of service to others. EIA also reserves the right to block robots that do not contain contact information that can be used to contact the owner. Blocking may occur in real time. 

**NOTE:** Robots using a specific IP address instead of an official EIA URL (examples: www.eia.gov or ir.eia.gov) are at risk for not receiving data promptly at prescribed times.
