### eircom privacy statement:

We have developed this privacy statement because we want you to feel confident about the privacy and security of your personal details when you visit or use the eircom.ie website. We operate a strict opt-in policy for residential customers. We will not send you any information unless you have requested it, or unless someone, who we will identify, has requested that we pass that information on to you. We will not pass on your details to any third party for email or marketing purposes.

eircom Limited is registered with the Data Protection Commissioner as a Data Controller and all handling and processing of your personal data is strictly in accordance with the data protection principles contained in the Data Protection Acts, 1988-2003.

The eircom.ie servers are located in a secure facility and any access to your personal data is strictly controlled and limited only to persons who are authorised and have appropriate security clearance to access the servers.

Credit card and Laser card details are stored by eircom in an encrypted form to provide extra security for your online transactions.

#### How we collect information:

You have the option to register on the eircom.ie website where you will need to provide us with some personal details to complete registration such as a username, password, telephone number and account number. This will allow us to provide you with value add services such as viewing and paying your bill online, ability to order products and services and log and track a fault when you fully register with the site. You can also provide us with additional information, which will allow us to provide you with a more personalised experience whenever you visit our website.

Customers should note that, while eircom makes all commercial efforts to protect our customers’ privacy, customers should be aware that information disclosed while connected to the Internet is transferred to the eircom servers over a publicly available telecommunications network. eircom cannot be held responsible, and accept no liability, for unauthorised access to the public network beyond its reasonable control and all information provided by customers is done entirely at the customers’ own risk.

#### How we use your information:

We use your information provided to offer you a more personalised online experience and to inform you of products and services relevant to your needs. Registration also allows you access to value-add services such as e-billing, fault logging and ordering products in the online store. Your personal information may also be used to verify your identity, to protect against fraud, and to send you relevant updates e.g. notification of your bill. eircom does not share your information with any third party.

#### Opt-in / Opt-out:

We operate a strict opt-in policy for our residential customers. That means we will not send you any information unless you have requested to receive email updates from us.  For business customers, we operate, in compliance with the relevant legislation, an opt-out policy.

If you (whether a residential or business customer) wish to be removed from our list, at any time, (opt-out) you can do so by clicking on the link at the bottom of each email communication you receive from us, and if it is to do with billing notification you can turn this option off by selecting email notifications in the [View Your Bill](https://web.archive.org/cgi-bin/bvsm/bveircom/register/registerLogin.jsp?site=Res&cid=viewBill&BV_SessionID=@@@@1093366767.1257144345@@@@&BV_EngineID=ccchadeikdhigekcefeceiedfgodfik.0)  section.
