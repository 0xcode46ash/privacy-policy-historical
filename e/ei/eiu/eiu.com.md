**Collection and use of user details**  
Personal details of users of **eiu.com** will be collected and processed upon registration to our website. 

All personal information is collected with the knowledge of **eiu.com** customers via the website’s order and registration forms only. 

This information is collected for the following purposes: 

  * order fulfilment; 
  * to notify customers of relevant new products; 
  * to notify users of promotional activities both within the Economist Intelligence Unit and across The Economist Group of companies.

User information is retained for in-house research to: 
  * improve our understanding of customer needs and product development; 
  * build marketing profiles; 
  * aid strategic development; and 
  * manage our relationship with advertisers.

All results of such research and analysis will be anonymised or aggregated information and will not reveal any personal facts about individual customers. 

The Economist Intelligence Unit is part of The Economist Group, which operates from offices worldwide. Steps have been taken to ensure that consistently high standards of data protection are adhered to in all regional offices for all the forms of processing mentioned above. 

**User choices**  
All registration and order forms provide users with a series of choices regarding further promotional activity, forms of communication and third party processing. 

When filling out order or registration forms on **eiu.com** , users should indicate whether they are receptive to the use of e-mail to inform them of further Economist Intelligence Unit promotional literature. If you are keen to be kept informed of further Economist Intelligence Unit products as well as technical and functional developments related to our website and online services, please tick the e-mail opt-in box. 

You may also indicate whether you wish to receive such information from other Economist Group businesses. 

The Economist Intelligence Unit will occasionally allow other similar but reputable organisations to contact you. If you do not wish to hear from these companies, please tick the appropriate box on the order/registration form to opt out of such activity.

The Economist Intelligence Unit will maintain appropriate measures to ensure that users’ personal details are not misused, accidentally destroyed, lost or altered within the Economist Intelligence Unit server environment. 

All personal data are encrypted for transmission over the Internet to Economist Intelligence Unit servers. 

Occasions will arise when customer information is passed outside the Economist Intelligence Unit to other data processors (fulfilment bureaus, database consultants, etc), but they will only act upon, instruction from the Economist Intelligence Unit in order to perform the services required.
