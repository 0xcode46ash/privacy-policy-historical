**Pathfinder Privacy Policy**

The site you are about to view follows the Pathfinder Privacy Policy. The Pathfinder web sites are maintained by Time Inc. New Media, 1271 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY, 10020. We can be reached by e-mail at [privacy@pathfinder.com.](mailto:privacy@pathfinder.com)

These sites collect no personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. In addition, Pathfinder may place a "cookie" in the browser files of a Pathfinder user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information although it will enable Pathfinder to relate a user's use of Pathfinder to information that the user has specifically and knowingly provided to Pathfinder.

A user's personally identifying information may be used by Time Inc. New Media for editorial purposes. Time Inc. New Media may also use such information for marketing and promotional purposes and may share the information with companies that it has pre-screened. Individuals always have the ability to stop their information being used for such purposes by sending an e-mail request to Time Inc. New Media at the address given above.

A user's personally identifying information will not be transferred to any other party unless otherwise stated at the time of collection. While Time Inc. New Media will seek to require third parties with whom it has agreements to follow appropriate privacy policies, Time Inc. New Media does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of such third parties.

Pathfinder users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.

**KIDS** : Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself to us or anyone else over the Internet.  
**PARENTS** : Any such information collected by Pathfinder from children is used for editorial participation and feedback purposes, together with any other purposes that will be described where the information is collected, and will not be transferred to any third party. Cookies placed by Time Inc. New Media for use throughout the Pathfinder Network will not be used to collect information in areas within the Pathfinder Network that are geared to children.

Users can send e-mail to us at [privacy@pathfinder.com](mailto:privacy@pathfinder.com) with any further questions.
