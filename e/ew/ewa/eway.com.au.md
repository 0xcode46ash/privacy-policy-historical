Some of our business partners (e.g. advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies. 

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

In order to use this Website, you must first complete the registration form and create a username and password. During registration you are required to give contact information (such as name and Email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. 

You have the option to provide company demographic information (such as industry type and business size) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you with a more personalised experience on our site. eWAY and its parent company Web Active Corporation Pty Ltd is the sole owner of the information collected on [www.eway.com.au](http://www.eway.com.au/). eWAY collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Website.

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, Email, and postal address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). 

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

eWAY uses personally identifiable information for essential communications, such as confirmation Emails, accounts information, and critical service details. We may also use this information for other purposes, including some promotional Emails.  If at any time a customer wishes not to receive such correspondence, they can request to be removed from any mailing lists by emailing us at [support@eway.com.au](mailto:support@eway.com.au "eWAY Support") 

You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.

We use other third parties to provide the essential links between the merchants, the banks and ourselves in order to provide credit card payment gateway services on our site. When you sign up for eWAY, we will share your Internet Merchant Account details as necessary for the third party to provide that service. 

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. 

eWAY does not share any information with third parties for any unknown or unrelated uses.

Our third party advertising partner, Google Adwords, and tracking utility partner, Direct News, employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. 

To learn more about our advertising company's use of clear gifs, please go to [https://adwords.google.com](https://adwords.google.com/ "Google Adwords")

If you use the eWAY forum on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website.

We post customer testimonials on our website which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If at any time the customer feels that they no longer wish to have their testimonial posted on the site they can request for it to be removed by emailing us at [support@eway.com.au](mailto:support@eway.com.au "eWAY Support").

eWAY provides free-of-charge a directory for associated partners to join.  This is a process initiated and completed entirely by the partner, with all information submitted by the partner.  If at any time the partner feels that they no longer wish to be a part of this directory they can request to be removed by emailing us at [support@eway.com.au](mailto:support@eway.com.au "eWAY Support").

There are many links on the eWAY site to external entities. The terms and conditions set out in this privacy statement only covers the domain name of www.eway.com.au.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can email us at [support@eway.com.au](mailto:support@eway.com.au "eWAY Support"). 

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on the Your Profile page in the eWAY Administration Area or by emailing our Customer Support at [support@eway.com.au](mailto:support@eway.com.au "eWAY Support") or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by Email, or by means of a notice on our homepage.
