# Privacy Policy - eKstreme.com

Although eKstreme.com is a personal site, I do collect some information about the visitors. This page describes what exactly gets collected, why, and how it is stored. I am not a lawyer, so I will not give you a legal document, but will give you a simple explanation.

## Browsing Pattern Information

eKstreme.com uses [PHPCounter](https://web.archive.org/phpcounter/) to keep counts on the number of visitors I get.

The information that gets collected is: Web browser and version, page requested, time of visit, referring link (if any), and the remote IP.

This information is aggregated into large log files and analysed in one go. For example, I know that Internet Explorer is the most popular browser used to visit eKstreme.com, and that Windows users account for 90% of the visitors. I also get information about which countries the visitors come from. For example, The Netherlands is the highest ranking non-English country where visitors come from. These examples are meant to illustrate that I do not care about personally identifiable information.

## Personal Information Submitted to eKstreme.com

eKstreme.com contains a guestbook, a feedback form, and can contain other means of directly submitting to me personal information. I do NOT share/sell/lease this information with/to third parties. I hate spam very much too!

### Support and Feedback Form

Most feedback I get relates to support of the scripts in [PHPLabs](https://web.archive.org/phplabs/). Once the problem is sorted, most emails get deleted. I respect everyone's privacy deeply.

### Guestbook

The guestbook is also a means of people to add to the contents of eKstreme.com that is beyond my control. I keep an eye on the submissions and delete any posts that are not appropriate.

## Copyright

Unless otherwise stated, all contents on eKstreme.com, including text and images are my creation, and are copyrighted. Due credit is given to creations I know that are not mine.

## Contact

If you have any questions, you can contact me using the [contact form](https://web.archive.org/contact.php).
