Cookies cannot profile your system or collect information from your hard drive. Most On-Line retailers use cookies to provide better customer experience.  
We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

EKWB uses Cookies to let us know you are a prior customer and thus you will not need to re-enter certain information every time you shop at the site. We do not use cookies to store credit card numbers, address information or any other personal information, that data is stored only in case you open an Account at the site and you enter the data manually. By placing an order you are required to provide this data anyway so we can ship you the goods. Credit card information is not stored at EKWB at all, we use Paypal as payment processing party and all information you exchange with them directly, we only receive confirmation from Paypal that funds have been transferred to our Paypal account.
