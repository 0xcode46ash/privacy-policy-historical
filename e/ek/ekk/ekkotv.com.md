Privacy Policy for ekko, Inc.  
Effective Date: October, 2008

ekko, Inc. ("ekko," "we," "us," or “our”) respects and understands its website users' concerns about confidentiality and privacy. As such, we have developed this Privacy Policy to disclose our privacy practices and describe the information we collect about you and how we might use this information. We suggest that you refer to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis as it may change at any time in our sole discretion, for business purposes or technological or legal reasons. By using the application service on this website (the “Service”), you accept the practices that are described in this Privacy Policy as part of the Terms of Use governing the Service.

INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT  
We collect information in different areas of our Service. The nature of the information we collect depends on the areas of our Service that you use. For example, we require that you provide us with [your name, address, email address and telephone number.] If you do not wish to provide us with this or any other requested information, you will not be permitted to use the Services. Additionally, the Service may allow you to voluntarily disclose additional information to us through a survey or in an email.

In the course of using our Service, we may automatically track certain information about you. This information may include the URL that you came from (whether this URL is on our website or not), which URL you go to next (whether this URL is on our website or not), what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. Many sites automatically collect this information.

We may also decide to use cookies on certain pages of our Service. Cookies can help us provide information which is targeted to your unique interests. Importantly, cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. Moreover, most cookies are "session cookies," meaning they are automatically deleted at the end of a web-browsing session. [Discuss.]

OUR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION  
We use personally identifiable information internally to improve our goods and services, to statistically analyze usage of our Service, to improve and customize our content, and for other general customer service purposes. We believe these uses allow us to improve our Service and better tailor it to meet your needs. We may disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties solely for purposed of providing service to us. We may also disclose or use personally identifiable information to investigate or respond to any violations of our Terms of Use or any state or federal law as discussed below.

We do not disclose, sell, lend or rent personally identifiable information about you to any third-parties outside of ekko or one of our related entities unless it is reasonably necessary in order to provide you with information, goods or services that you have requested.

We may also use personally identifiable information to deliver information that, in some cases, is targeted to your needs and interests, such as promotional e-mails, targeted banners and promotions. If you supply us with your e-mail or mailing address, you may receive occasional mail or email from us or a service provider on our behalf announcing services, product information, promotional events or updates to our Service. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please send an e-mail to [support@ekko.im](mailto:support@ekko.im) with the word "Remove" in the subject line.

In the event our company is ever sold or reorganized, we reserve the right to transfer ownership of our e-mail list and other personally identifiable information to the acquiring company or other successor.

We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you as required by law, including voluntary disclosures to law enforcement agencies and government officials, as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.

We may also disclose or use personally identifiable information to investigate and respond to any customer complaints or violations of our Terms of Use.

Unfortunately, we cannot ensure that information will never be disclosed in ways other than as described in this Privacy Policy, including, without limitation, as the result of third-parties unlawfully intercepting or accessing files, transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect personally identifiable information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private. 

THIRD-PARTY COLLECTORS OF INFORMATION  
Our Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If your information is disclosed by you to third parties, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of your information. Such third-parties adhere to their own privacy customs and policies. Therefore, we do not make any representations or warranties as to how such third-parties may use your information. 

NOTIFICATION OF MATERIAL CHANGES TO THIS POLICY  
This Section identifies material changes to this Policy since the Effective Date.
