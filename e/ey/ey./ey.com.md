# Ernst & Young - Privacy Policy

## Privacy policy

Privacy policy for Ernst & Young global pages

Ernst & Young intends for ey.com to complement the services that the firm provides. This statement sets forth our privacy policy for the global pages of the Ernst & Young website, describing the practices we follow to respect the privacy of all visitors.

At Ernst & Young, we have focused on implementing fair information practices that are designed to protect your privacy. We believe that everyone benefits from the free flow of information when that information is gathered and used responsibly. Please be aware that ey.com contains links to other sites, including sites maintained by Ernst & Young, which are not governed by this privacy policy. 

If you have questions or you do not feel that your concerns have been addressed in our privacy statement, or you just want to talk with us, feel free to contact us.

If you are merely a visitor to ey.com, Ernst & Young does not collect any personal information about you, except to the limited extent through the use of cookies, which are described below. There are a number of circumstances, however, in which we may collect information.

**Job search**  
The global area of our website does not itself offer any job search opportunities; it does, however, link to the job search sections of Ernst & Young country sites. Please look for privacy policies of the specific countries that interest you. 

**Thought Center webcast section**  
To view an Ernst & Young [Thought Center webcast](http://webcast.ey.com/thoughtcenter/interfaces/ey2/pages/description.asp) (live or archived), registration is required. When you register, you must provide your name, email and mailing addresses, country, industry, company, position and phone number. At the time of registration, you are also asked whether or not you are a client of Ernst & Young, and whether or not you would like to be informed of upcoming webcasts via email alerts. Information collected at registration is protected using industry-standard encryption technology as it is sent over the Internet. All information is required in order to view any webcast. At the time of registration, you can check a box to automate the log-in process, which allows you to be automatically logged on when you return to our webcast section using the same computer. We use registration information for internal research and analysis purposes only, to help us understand who is viewing our webcasts, and become better equipped to serve your needs. Ernst & Young does not sell, distribute or disclose personally identifiable information collected at webcast registration to any third parties, except as may be required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process.

Ernst & Young gives you choices regarding the collection and usage of your personally identifiable information. If you have registered for Thought Center webcast alerts, and do not wish to receive future emails, please open a previous webcast email you have received, and click the link (or copy and paste the URL) at the bottom: "To remove yourself from the mailing list..." If you do not have a previous email, use the "[update your profile](http://webcast.ey.com/thoughtcenter/default.asp?action=update_profile)" function, where you can also submit any changes to your personal profile, including being removed from the email list. Because we do not require a password to use the section, we do not allow you to directly view or change your personal profile. This is for your privacy and protection. Any requests we receive via the "update your personal profile" function will be verified via your email address, which means you must enter the same one you entered when first registering. 

If you are interested in Thought Center webcasts, but you do not wish to provide any personally identifiable information, you can read the executive summaries ("webcast recaps") posted on ey.com after the event, which require no registration. 

**Cookies**  
The Ernst & Young ey.com website and/or any of its governed sections may use cookies. A cookie is technology that allows our site to store tokens of information (an ”identifier”) in your browser used only by our site while you are on our site. Cookies are not used to determine the personal identity of anyone merely visiting ey.com. They help us track traffic patterns so that we know which areas of our site users like/don't like. 

Cookies have other uses as well. In the Thought Center webcast section, they are used to provide entry for subscribers who have chosen the “automatic log-on” feature during registration. Cookies are also used to prevent online poll participants from voting more than once on a particular issue. 

If you do not want to receive a cookie from ey.com, you have the option of setting your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie so that you may determine whether to accept it or not (see your browser settings to do that). However, please be aware that if you do turn off cookies in your browser, you will not be able to fully experience the features of the Thought Center webcast section — such as automatic log-on and other personalization features. 

**Data security/integrity**  
Ernst & Young has technological and operational security functions in place to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. The data you may provide is shared only with authorized employees of Ernst & Young, and on a limited basis, by vendors who supply information management services. Access to your information is limited by need, and those who have access to the data have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. In addition, Ernst & Young may disclose personally identifiable information as may be required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process.

**Accountability**  
Ernst & Young supports and is involved in consumer, government and industry efforts to identify and resolve privacy issues.

**Changes to this policy**  
Ernst & Young may change this policy statement as needed. If changes to the statement are made, please note that it may take up to 30 business days before new privacy practices are implemented.

**Consumer recourse**  
If you have any questions or concerns regarding your privacy while using ey.com, please contact us .
