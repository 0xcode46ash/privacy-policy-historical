## Privacy

Ernst & Young intends for ey.com to complement the services that the firm provides. This statement, set forth below, is our privacy statement for the global network of our professional services firms and their affiliated and associated entities.

Here we describe the practices we follow to respect the privacy of all visitors to this site. At Ernst & Young, we have focused on implementing fair information practices that are designed to protect your privacy. We believe that everyone benefits from the free flow of information when that information is gathered and used responsibly.

If you have questions or you do not feel that your concerns have been addressed in our privacy statement, [contact us](https://web.archive.org/US/en/Home/Home-ContactUs).

#### Collection, use, disclosure, choice

Registration is not required for you to use our site. If you are merely a visitor to ey.com, we do not collect any personal information about you, except to the limited extent through the use of cookies, which are described above. However, there may be circumstances in which you choose to register to ongoing updates from Ernst & Young.

In these cases, Ernst & Young may contact registrants to invite them to special events, provide them with information about our services, publications and products, or for other marketing purposes.

Information collected at registration is protected using industry-standard encryption technology as it is sent over the Internet. For example, you may choose to register for:

  1.  **Email alerts**  
Ernst & Young offers an email alert service to site visitors, in which we send subscribers email updates when new information is added to ey.com. If you decide to subscribe, we will collect basic contact information about you, such as your name and email address.
  2.  **Expressing an interest in working for Ernst & Young**  
The Ernst & Young Web site enables you to register your interest in working for us or applying for an advertised vacancy. For more detail about the recruitment process and the information required, visit the careers section of ey.com.
  3.  **Thought Center Webcasts**  
To view an Ernst & Young Thought Center Webcast (live or archived), registration is required. When you register, you must provide your name, email and mailing addresses, country, industry, company, position and phone number. At the time of registration, you are also asked whether or not you are a client of Ernst & Young, and whether or not you would like to be informed of upcoming webcasts via Thought Center Webcast email alerts. All information is required in order to view any webcast. At the time of registration, you can check a box to automate the log-in process, which allows you to be automatically logged on upon your return to the Ernst & Young Thought Center Webcast section when using the same computer. We use registration information for internal research and analysis purposes to help us understand who is viewing our webcasts, and become better equipped to serve your needs.  
If you are interested in Thought Center Webcasts, but you do not wish to provide any personally identifiable information, you can read the executive summaries ("webcast recaps") posted on ey.com, which require no registration.
  4.  **Surveys**  
Ernst & Young may conduct surveys via its web site. Survey participants may be asked for personal information (name, contact information, etc.) in addition to opinions or feedback. The type of information collected in surveys will vary.
  5.  **Thought leadership registration**  
Ernst & Young occasionally requires registration in exchange for our thought leadership: white papers, articles, studies, reports, survey analyses, booklets, etc. Personal information may be asked for on registration forms and the type of information collected may vary. Ernst & Young reserves the right to distribute certain thought leadership materials only to those who supply the requested information.
  6.  **Event registration**  
Ernst & Young facilitates event registration via its own web site or, at times, via third party web sites. Personal information may be collected via event registration forms and the type of information collected will vary. Ernst & Young may share registrant information with third parties in association with the event. Examples of "third parties" include hotels, sponsors or co-sponsors, promoters, event organizers (including via third party web sites), speakers, panellists, etc. Please check the details provided at individual events to understand fully how your information will be used.
  7.  **Entrepreneur Of The Year®**

Personal information, including financial data, is required of the nominee, and the nominee must sign the nomination form. Nomination forms are provided to the program sponsors and independent national and regional panels of judges in order to select award recipients. Further, some of the information on the nomination form may be used for research, educational, or any other purpose, but we will not divulge the personal identity of the nominee or the identity of the nominee's company to any person other than the sponsors, the judges, and their respective affiliates. Nominees must consent to this usage in order to participate in the nomination process. The nominator may include their own personal information on the form, however, it is may not always be required. If nominator information is supplied, it is subject to the same terms as nominee information.

####  **Third-party links**

Please be aware that ey.com sometimes contains links to other sites that are not governed by this privacy policy. Visitors to our site may be directed to third-party sites for more information, such as about our thought leadership, events, content sponsorships, vendor services, government entities, non-profits, and social networks. Ernst & Young makes no representations or warranties regarding how user data is stored or used on third-party servers. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of each third-party site linked from ey.com to determine their use of your personal data.

####  **Cookies**

The Ernst & Young ey.com Web site and/or any of its governed sections may use cookies. A "cookie" is technology that allows our site to store tokens of information (an 'identifier') in your browser used only by our site while you are on our site. Cookies are not used to determine the personal identity of anyone who is merely visiting ey.com. They serve to help us track traffic patterns to determine a user’s preferred location and language so that we can direct them to the correct home page when they visit ey.com.

Cookies have other uses as well. In the Thought Center Webcast section, they are used to provide entry for subscribers who have chosen the automatic log-on feature during registration. Cookies are also used to prevent online poll participants from voting more than once. If you do not want to receive a cookie from ey.com or the Thought Center Webcast section, you have the option of setting your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, so that you may determine whether to accept it or not. However, please be aware that if you do turn off 'cookies' in your browser, you will not be able to fully experience the features of the Thought Center Webcast section—such as automatic log-on and other personalization features.

"Web Beacons." Ernst & Young occasionally advertises on third party Web sites. As part of our effort to track the success of our advertising campaigns, we may at times use a technology called "web beacons," or "action tags," which count visitors who have come to ey.com after being exposed to an Ernst & Young banner ad on a third party site. We do not use this technology to access your personal information; it is only used to compile aggregated statistics about visitors who come to ey.com and to gauge the effectiveness of our ads.

####  **Children**

This privacy statement is not intended for use by children. We understand the importance of protecting children’s information, especially in an online environment, and we do not knowingly collect or maintain information about children.

####  **Changes to this policy**

Ernst & Young may change this policy statement as needed. If changes to the statement are made, please note that it may take up to 30 business days before new privacy practices are implemented. Check this page periodically if you would like to monitor changes.
