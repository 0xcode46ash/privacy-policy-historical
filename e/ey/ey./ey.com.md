For more information as to how we use cookies, please [see the applicable section here](https://www.ey.com/us/en/home/privacy#cookies).

**Collection, Use, Disclosure, Choice**

If you are merely a visitor to ey.com, Ernst & Young does not collect any personal information about you, except to the limited extent through the use of cookies, which are described below. However, there may be circumstances in which you choose to register for ongoing updates from EY. In these cases, EY may contact registrants to invite them to special events, provide them with information about our services, publications and products, or for other marketing purposes. Information collected at registration is protected using industry-standard encryption technology as it is sent over the Internet.

You may choose to register for:

**_Your Choice._** Ernst & Young gives you choices regarding the collection and usage of your personally identifiable information. To update any application or resume you have submitted, please apply again via the job search section, and re-submit your updated information. Due to volume, Ernst & Young cannot personally respond to individual requests for applicant status.

Your information is required in order to view any webcast. At the time of registration, you can check a box to automate the log-in process, which allows you to be automatically logged on when you return to the Ernst & Young Thought Center Webcast section using the same computer. We use registration information for internal research and analysis purposes only, to help us understand who is viewing our webcasts, and become better equipped to serve your needs.

**_Your Choice._** Ernst & Young gives you choices regarding the collection and usage of your personally identifiable information.

  * _Essential/Strictly Necessary Cookies_
  * _Performance Cookies_
  * _Functionality Cookies_
  * _Targeting and Tracking Cookies_



These cookies collect information relating to the origin of your visit, where you were exposed to EY advertising, what advertising feature you saw, whether you arrived directly or indirectly to Our Site, the device you used to visit Our Site and which downloads you performed. This information is collected on an anonymous basis via third party suppliers.

In addition, we also utilize cookies on certain pages of Our Site to communicate with third party data suppliers in order to extrapolate your digital behavior.

Ernst & Young cannot be held responsible if you share personal information on Social Media Platforms that is subsequently used, misused or otherwise appropriated by another user.

Ernst & Young may also provide links to other social media platforms maintained on separate servers by individuals or organizations over which Ernst & Young has no control.

Ernst & Young identifies and works with small, minority- and women-owned businesses. Our procurement teams use a supplier diversity database when searching for qualified suppliers. Certified companies can register to join our database via our web site (www.ey.com/us/supplierdiversity). The type of information collected on the secure registration form is standard in the supplier diversity industry, and the required information on the form is necessary to become part of our database. This information enables Ernst & Young to make informed procurement decisions.

The registration form and the supplier database are maintained by a third party, who has agreed in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection for all Ernst & Young registrant data. If you have already registered, and would like to view or update your information, please log on to the site (a "Forgot Your Password?" feature is available there). If you have questions about our supplier diversity policies, please email the supplier diversity group.

Ernst & Young understands the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive, online world. Our Site does not intentionally target or solicit to children 13 and younger. Some of the firm's other online services may be designed to educate children on financial and other matters. These Ernst & Young sites are not governed by this privacy policy but will have their own privacy policies that more fully explain how they respect and protect the privacy of children while providing them valuable information, fun, and education.
