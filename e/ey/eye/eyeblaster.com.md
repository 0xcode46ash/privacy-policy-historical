# privacy policy - Eyeblaster – Cross Channel Campaign Management, Ad Serving and Rich Media for advertisers and agencies

[Click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20090403144933id_/http%3A//www.eyeblaster.com/Content.aspx?page=contact_us) for important information about safe surfing from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

**Advertising and Content Served through Eyeblaster Technology**

Eyeblaster firmly believes in the importance of online privacy for its advertisers, publishers and users. Eyeblaster does not collect any personally-identifying information before, during or after the delivery of its clients’ advertisements. Eyeblaster's technology may collect non-personally identifying general information related to campaign results such as total number of delivered impressions (ads), click-through, etc. 

Eyeblaster’s technology may employ cookies to collect non-personally identifying information in the course of providing its clients with its ad-serving services and for the purpose of helping its clients determine which advertisement is suitable to be delivered to a user. A cookie is a small text file that can be stored on a user’s computer when that computer’s browser views one of Eyeblaster’s client's advertisements or websites. The cookie is associated with and unique to the specific computer. The cookie does not contain the user’s name, address, phone number, email address, or anything that personally identifies it. Eyeblaster collects into the cookie only non-personally identifying information such as the type of the computer’s operating system, type of internet browser software, what web pages were viewed and at what time, geographic location of user's internet service provider, anonymous demographic information collected through anonymous online survey such as gender and age block.

**The Eyeblaster.com Website**

Eyeblaster does not collect any personally-identifying information before, during or after a user's visit other than what is supplied voluntarily by the user. When personal or business information is provided by the user, this information is used by Eyeblaster solely for the purposes identified at the point of contact.

**The Opt-Out Cookie**

Eyeblaster allows consumers to opt out of the Eyeblaster ad-serving cookie, so that no unique information or number is associated with their computer's browser. Blocking and/or opting out of cookies does not stop advertisements from being served to your computer; rather, it prevents data from being associated with your browser. Please note that if you choose an opt-out cookie, we will be unable to recognize your browser from one visit to the next, and you may therefore receive the same ad multiple times. 

[Click here](http://as.serving-sys.com/OptOut/SetOptOut.asp?OptOut=TRUE) for the ad-serving cookie opt-out. All other cookies associated with your browser will remain intact and your opt-out will be effective with respect to the browser used as long as you do not delete the cookie file from your hard drive. This opt-out process will erase the cookie ID but not the cookie. It's necessary for us to store this "Keep Out" cookie on your computer in order to recognize you as an opt-out user. 

If you’ve previously opted out and would like to reverse your setting, [click here](http://www.eyeblaster.com/Opt_in_confirmation.asp) to opt back in.

**Third Party Disclaimer**

On occasion, an advertiser may request that Eyeblaster provides or assists in the data collection of information supplied voluntarily by consumers within the body of Eyeblaster ads, which may include personal information fields filled by the user. Eyeblaster does so only on behalf of that advertiser. This information is understood by Eyeblaster to be used solely by that advertiser for the purposes identified within the advertisement to provide the user with requested goods, services, or information as established within that advertiser's privacy policy. Eyeblaster is not responsible for the advertisers' use of this voluntarily supplied data. Eyeblaster does not distribute this information to any party other than those indicated within the advertisement. Eyeblaster never associates any of this information with any data gathered or used in the delivery of that advertisement. This information is provided directly to the advertiser, and is not collected or kept by either Eyeblaster or the publisher's site on which the advertisement is displayed. 

**Changes to this Document**  
Eyeblaster reserves the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this policy at any time and without notice. If we change our privacy policy, we will make every effort to post those changes in this area so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
