EyeWonder, Inc. ("EyeWonder") recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of visitors to its web site (the "Site") and the information shared by them. Below is EyeWonder's policy on collecting, using, disclosing, maintaining and protecting the information provided to it through the Site. Any questions or concerns regarding these policies or practices should be directed to:

     Information collected through the Site varies, depending on the sections of the Site visited and the information the visitor chooses to provide. For visitors to the public sections of the Site who read or download information, EyeWonder collects only non-personally identifiable information about the visit, including the IP address of the visitor's computer, the visitor's type of computer and operating system, the date and time of access, and the URL of the web site from which the visitor linked directly to the Site. EyeWonder does not collect any personally identifiable information from visitors who visit only the public sections of the Site. For visitors who contact EyeWonder via e-mail or who participate in an EyeWonder online survey, the information provided in the e-mail message or survey response is collected, including the visitor's e-mail address, and any questions or comments the visitor provides. EyeWonder may use "cookies" or "scripts" to collect any of the information described above. Some Internet browsers can be adjusted to disable the use of cookies and scripts; however, some functionalities of the Site may not be available without the use of cookies and scripts.   
      Information EyeWonder collects is used for EyeWonder's internal business purposes, including studying the use of the Site. If a question or comment is sent to EyeWonder by e-mail, then EyeWonder uses the information therein to respond to the question or comment. EyeWonder also may use the information provided to it to send news and information that EyeWonder believes may be of interest. In addition, EyeWonder may disclose information concerning the Site and its visitors in aggregate, non-personally identifiable form. From time to time, EyeWonder may disclose to others personally identifiable information about visitors in connection with the operation of the Site. For example, EyeWonder provides certain personally identifiable information to its vendors and licensors in order to permit EyeWonder to provide various products and services to the visitor.   
     When EyeWonder obtains personally identifiable information from a visitor to the Site, EyeWonder provides the opportunity to "opt-out" of any third party disclosure of that information or its use in ways unrelated to the operation of the Site. Visitors who later decide to "opt-out" of such disclosures, may do so by contacting EyeWonder at the address above. In addition, any visitor who chooses not to receive any news or information from EyeWonder may let EyeWonder know by it at the address above.   
     EyeWonder uses industry-standard security measures to protect any personally identifiable information provided to it. However, EyeWonder cannot guarantee that submissions to the Site, or that any content residing on, or transmissions from, EyeWonder's servers will be completely secure.   
     Any password-protected areas of the Site can be accessed only with a valid password. Each password owner is responsible for keeping the password secret and confidential, and for notifying EyeWonder if the password may have been stolen or might otherwise be misused.
