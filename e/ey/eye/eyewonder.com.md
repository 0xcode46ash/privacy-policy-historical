From time to time, advertisers, publishers or portals request that EyeWonder collect, or assist in the collection of, information supplied by consumers in connection with an EyeWonder® advertisement, or a user’s interaction with such an advertisement, which may include personal information. This information is provided directly to the advertiser, publisher and/or portal, and is not used independently by EyeWonder.
