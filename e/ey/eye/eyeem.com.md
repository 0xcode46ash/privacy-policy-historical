EyeEm offers a platform (hereinafter "EyeEm Community") in which users can share their photos with the community, search for photos of other users or comment on them. The services can be accessed via the mobile EyeEm app (hereinafter "App") or on www.eyeem.com (hereinafter "Website"). Moreover, EyeEm provides a marketplace (hereinafter "EyeEm Market) on which users can offer their photos to others for licensing.

EyeEm Mobile GmbH, Kohlfurter Str. 41/43, 10999 Berlin, Germany (hereinafter "EyeEm" or "we/our") is legally responsible for the collection, processing, and use of personal data in connection with the services provided by EyeEm Community and EyeEm Market, and takes the protection of personal data very seriously. The following explanations give an overview of what data is collected, for what purpose, and how EyeEm ensures protection of your data.

### 1 How is personal data collected, processed and used?

1.1 We collect, process and use your personal data, i.e. information about you as a person, only to the extent necessary to provide our services. This, for example, is the case during the registration process in order to allow the use of EyeEm Community and/or EyeEm Market and to carry out transactions (including verifying the identity of buyers and sellers). User registration information for EyeEm Community includes name, email address, username and/or profile picture. For joining EyeEm Market, additional information such as address, date of birth, tax number and PayPal account information may need to be provided. In order to fulfil EyeEm Market transactions, EyeEm Market users must always provide their real name; the use of an alias is not possible.

1.2 We also collect, process and use your personal data to improve the use of EyeEm services and ensure their technical functionality, to develop new services, or to make the services more attractive for you. Among others, cookies and similar technologies will be used for this. You can find further details on this in the "Cookies" section below.

1.3 We also collect, process and use personal data to send you information via push notification or email. You can select, at any time, which alerts you want to receive via the App (push notifications) and via email (including newsletters, promotional information and Community updates) by selecting "Settings" in your EyeEm account. We will send you corresponding information on the topics selected by you (e.g. if your photo has been selected for the EyeEm Collection or EyeEm Blog or if your photo has been sold). If you do not want to receive promotional emails, you can unsubscribe at any time via the link provided in the email.

1.4 We also collect and process information that is embedded in the metadata of the photo (exif data such as date, time and location when/where the photo has been taken, camera model, shutter speed, etc.) and use such information for the purposes of our services, i.e. to increase the chances of selling your photo through EyeEm Market. We will collect and process information on the location where your photo has been taken (a) if such information is contained in the Exif data of the photo or (b) if it is clearly visible and attributable (such as with landmarks, etc.) or (c) if you have added such data when uploading the photo. To enable you to add location data in the upload process, we use the Foursquare Labs, Inc. database services.

1.5 As part of the App we also collect, process and use the personal data of your friends or followers on social networks if shared by you. If, for example, you use the "Find People" function, we check if some of your social networks contacts from Facebook, Inc. or Twitter, Inc. are also registered with EyeEm. We will only find them if they have registered on EyeEm with the corresponding social network.




### 2 When is personal data transmitted to a third party?

We transmit your personal data to third parties only where this is legally permissible. This may be when transmitting to a licensee or to suppliers contractually connected with us such as agencies, partners, or payment service providers whenever necessary in order for EyeEm to meet its licensing obligations. This may also be necessary if EyeEm is required to do so by a governmental or judicial order. When you have provided a Model and/or Property Release, we will store the data on our servers and can transmit such releases to distributors, licensees and third parties in order to prove the rights approval and/or to respond to any potential or actual legal action or to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and/or other legal requirements.

If you register with the EyeEm Community through the login function of the social networks of Facebook, Inc. or Google, Inc., EyeEm is given certain information on these services by default. More information can be found below in the "Connect Services" section below.
