M Beauty Ltd wants you to know that whether you're ordering online, or just browsing, your privacy is very important to us.

When visiting [www.eyeko.com](http://www.eyeko.com/), our server collects only the domain name and user specific information on the pages you access or visit. This information is collected as well as your e-mail address, if you e-mail us. We also collect any information you volunteer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

Any information that we gather is used to improve the content of our Web Site and notify you about the latest Eyeko products, services and events. If you do not wish to receive promotional e-mail from us, please e-mail, stating that you are not interested in receiving these notifications.

We use third-party marketing companies to assist us in providing marketing messages and analyzing the success of our marketing campaigns online and off-line. On our behalf, authorized companies may note some of the pages you visit on our site through the use of one-by-one pixel tags (also called clear gifs or web beacons or counting tags). A counting tag is a line of code embedded on certain pages of our site to tell us that we have a unique visitor on that page, and also which ad was successful in bringing visitors to our site. These tags do not collect or contain or transmit personally identifiable information. The counting and visit information collected on our behalf is used only by us. In the course of your visit to this site, we may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your computer's browser.

If you supply us with your telephone number online, you will be contacted by phone only if there is a question regarding an order you've placed online. We will not call you for promotional purposes, or share your telephone number with other companies.

If you supply us with a mailing address online when ordering a product or requesting a catalogue, you will be put into our customer file and may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events.
