# Eye-Fi Privacy Policy | Eye-Fi Support

Last Revised June 21, 2012

## Introduction

Eye-Fi is committed to protecting the confidentiality of your personal information, as well as the content of your photos and videos, according to your sharing preferences.

This document describes our policy regarding privacy protection, and identifies information sharing requirements and security measures taken by Eye-Fi. This policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Eye-Fi, Inc.

We may from time-to-time revise this Privacy Policy by posting notice of these revisions at this page no later than 30 days prior to the date that the revisions are to take effect, and in the case of material changes, we will notify you at the e-mail address associated with your account. The date of last revision will be available at the top of this page, so please be sure to check back periodically. If you have questions about this policy, contact us at [privacy@eye.fi](mailto:privacy@eye.fi).

## Personal Information We Collect

“Personal information” means (a) information that allows others to contact or to individually identify you, and (b) other information to the extent that it is associated with the information listed in (a). We collect personal information in the following ways:

You will need to create an Eye-Fi account to configure your Eye-Fi card’s wireless connectivity as well as to take advantage of the many additional Eye-Fi service offerings. The personal information that Eye-Fi requires you submit when creating an Eye-Fi account are your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access.

When you transfer your photos, videos and related EXIF data (collectively, “content”) from your Eye-Fi card or natively enabled Eye-Fi camera solely to your computer, smartphone, tablet or other supported Eye-Fi electronic device, Eye-Fi does not share or transfer any user content from your computer to Eye-Fi servers. However, if you choose to enable additional features or services offered by Eye-Fi, including the geotagging service, content sharing service (such as sharing with third party websites like Facebook, Flickr, Picasa, etc.), relayed uploads feature, Eye-Fi View service, email, notifications, sharing feature and hotspot service (collectively “Eye-Fi services”), Eye-Fi transfers your content to Eye-Fi’s servers and into your Eye-Fi account where the content can be acted upon in fulfillment of your requested Eye-Fi services.

When you access your Eye-Fi account and utilize Eye-Fi services, Eye-Fi automatically records certain information about your use, such as account activity, data displayed or clicked on, and other information including browser type, IP address, date and time of access, cookie ID, and referrer URL. Some of this information collected, such as IP address and the contents of certain cookies, may include personal information.

It is a violation of our terms of service for anyone under 13 to use the Eye-Fi services. Consequently, we do not intentionally gather personal information about visitors who are under the age of 13.

## How Your Personal Information is Used and Shared

Some Eye-Fi services are executed through third party business partners and service providers, and in these cases your personal information is shared with the third party business partner or service provider in order to fulfill the requested service.

From time to time, Eye-Fi may enter into relationships with strategic business partners to produce product offerings that are “co-branded” with the brands of both Eye-Fi and such strategic business partner. In those cases, if you purchase a co-branded product offering, Eye-Fi may share your personal information with the applicable third-party business partner in order to facilitate that business partner’s provision of support services, warranty services, or other elements of the co-branded product offering or related aftermarket services to you. For example, if Eye-Fi’s business partner is responsible for providing end-user support for the co-branded product in a given geographic territory, Eye-Fi may share your account information, support entitlement status, and other relevant personal information with such business partner to allow the business partner’s support personnel to provide support services to you.

When you use Eye-Fi to share your content with a third party website or to email your content to your friends, Eye-Fi will use your personal information to fulfill the requested services. Eye-Fi also uses your personal information to provide you with personalized content, to respond to your inquiries, to maintain and improve the Eye-Fi services, to alert you to new features or promotions, and to enforce the End User License Agreement and Terms of Service (called the “Terms of Service”).

In the future, Eye-Fi may sell our company or some or all or our assets. In such transactions, customer information (including your personal information) generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event a sale of our assets includes our database, your personal information will be transferred. We will require buyers to honor our Privacy Policy.

Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “Affiliates”), we may in the future. We may share some or all of your personal information with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.

Information Eye-Fi receives through its relationships with other companies and websites may be combined with the personal information we collect and will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We may also, and you authorize us to, share your personal information in response to a subpoena, legal order or official request, when we believe you have acted in violation of the Terms of Service, or when we believe that doing so may protect your safety or the safety of others.

Information that contains no personally identifiable information, i.e., deidentified data, may be shared with third parties or used for any reason.

## How Your Information is Protected, Maintained and Deleted

Eye-Fi attempts to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your personal information. Our servers and systems are protected by reasonable physical and electronic security measures.

You may delete your Eye-Fi account and all of your content at your discretion through the Eye-Fi Center software. Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, requests to delete your personal information and content are subject to all applicable legal obligations that Eye-Fi may be required to abide by, and you acknowledge that some copies of your content may remain in our archives.
