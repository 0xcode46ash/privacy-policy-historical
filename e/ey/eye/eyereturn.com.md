# eyeReturn: Privacy Policy

eyeReturn is committed to protecting your privacy, and promises to handle all information you provide either directly or indirectly to us with complete discretion. We will not release, sell or give your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information without your consent to any other entity, party or organization other than the sponsor of the campaign you participated in.

eyeReturn encourages all companies with which we do business (also called "clients"), to engage in fair information practices.

When eyeReturn acts as a technology provider, eyeReturn has been asked by the client (either Web site or Campaign sponsor) to act as an agent for media delivery or promotional campaign management. The information eyeReturn processes on such a client's behalf belongs to that client and is not used by eyeReturn or other companies.

If you have questions about our privacy policy, please contact us and we will address your concerns. Please email us at [support@eyereturn.com](mailto:support@eyereturn.com).
