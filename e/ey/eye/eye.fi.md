### Introduction

Eye-Fi takes the protection of your privacy seriously. Eye-Fi is committed to ensuring the confidentiality of your personal information and the content of your photos, according to your sharing preferences.

This document describes our policy regarding privacy protection, and identifies information sharing requirements and security measures taken by Eye-Fi. This policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Eye-Fi, Inc.

If you have questions about this policy, contact us at [privacy@eye.fi](https://web.archive.org/ask/).

### Information We Collect And Use

Personal information is information that others can use to identify you, such as your name, address, email address, social security number, credit card number or phone number.

Eye-Fi requires that you submit the following personal information when creating an Eye-Fi account and activating an Eye-Fi Card: your name and valid email address. 

When you use your Eye-Fi Card to upload pictures to a website, it connects to the Eye-Fi Service to facilitate the process. When your Eye-Fi Card uploads your photos via the Eye-Fi Service, Eye-Fi may store your photos and information about the photos in order to transmit them or to enable other services. When you use the Eye-Fi Card to upload pictures only to your computer, information about your photos and upload activity is not sent to or recorded by Eye-Fi.

Whether you create an Eye-Fi account and activate an Eye-Fi Card or not, Eye-Fi servers automatically record information sent by your browser when you use the Eye-Fi Manager or visit Eye-Fi websites. Collectively, Eye-Fi server logs may include information such as Internet Protocol address, browser type and language, date and time of request, one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser, and photo file size, date or other metadata from your camera (EXIF). 

Eye-Fi may use some personal information for auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve services, or to ensure the technical functioning of our network. In addition, Eye-Fi may aggregate and analyze anonymous account information, upload data or other service activity in order to assure quality and improve the services provided.

When you send email or other communication to Eye-Fi, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our service.

### How Your Information is Protected, Maintained and Deleted

Certain information you submit is stored in encrypted form on secure servers. Specifically, this includes financial information, such as credit card numbers if required, as well as the personal and account information associated with your chosen destination website or service for photo sharing.

Eye-Fi may retain and maintain the information indefinitely, but you may delete your Eye-Fi account at your discretion through the Eye-Fi Manager website. All personal information related to a deleted account is purged from Eye-Fi’s database.

### What Personal Information We Share With Others

Eye-Fi offers some services in connection with other websites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Eye-Fi in order to enable the service. Such information is processed in accordance with this Policy. The affiliated sites may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. 

If you elect to use the Eye-Fi Service to share photos online, Eye-Fi may provide select personal information, such as log-in information, to your chosen destination website as required in order to deliver your pictures. If you choose to share your pictures online, Eye-Fi may transmit photo metadata to your chosen destination website to enable features or services.

Eye-Fi features on its website links to retailers who sell the Eye-Fi Card. These retailers have their own privacy and information security practices and we encourage you to consult their policies. 

Eye-Fi only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Eye-Fi and the destination websites you request in the following limited circumstances: 

  * If Eye-Fi has your consent. Eye-Fi requires opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
  * If Eye-Fi has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Eye-Fi, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
  * If Eye-Fi becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, notice will be provided before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



Eye-Fi will not share any of your personal information with advertisers or other companies for marketing or promotion purposes without your consent.

### How We Use Cookies

If you are a registered user, we will use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services.

These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.
