## Remove Your Photos

We here at ejPix know that thousands of users are passionate about their Instagram photos and want to show them to the world. However, we also know that sometimes you just don't want photos shared. **Your privacy is something we take seriously.** We use a Public feed to pull our photos on the site. Meaning that, if the photos display on ejPix.com, they are also being displayed on other Internet sites. 

We have the ability to filter out your photos here but please keep in mind, we can't control other websites. **To remove your photo, simply send us the USER ID of the person who took the photo.** _This is always a number and can be found by clicking on the user icon underneath each photo._

An example of this is "10206720" which can be seen in the url of
