# Enago English Editing: Privacy & Security Policy

## Security Policy

We take the security of your information very seriously, and it is of the utmost concern to us here at Crimson Interactive Inc. (USA) (hereinafter CII). Protecting your information (personal, financial details and even the conversations) is always our top priority. We have been very careful in developing processes and employing technology to protect against any current and future security threats in these areas.

We use 128 bit Public/Private key encryption for data and files transfers, and hold high assurance SSL Certificates—a worldwide accepted security certificate and is the highest measure to prevent threats and plagiarism.

## Data Confidentiality

Data confidentiality covers data in storage, during processing, and in transit. CII guarantees that your data CIIwill not be accessed or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes and will be protected from international or accidental attempts to perform unauthorized data reads.

Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to authorized users—“the right people”—and preventing access by or disclosure to unauthorized ones—“the wrong people”.

Also critical to confidentiality—and data integrity and availability as well—are protections against malicious software (malware), spyware, spam and phishing attacks. All of CII servers are protected behind a firewall to prevent users from accessing them other than by specifically allowed protocols and methods. CII also maintains a detection method which picks up suspicious activity that may signal an intrusion and tracks each transaction by the user login details and provides a timestamp for each event.
