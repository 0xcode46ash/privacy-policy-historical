## Our Websites

Enphase Energy maintains two related websites. Our primary company website is located at [http://www.enphaseenergy.com](http://www.enphaseenergy.com/) and our remote monitoring website is located at [http://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com](http://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/). Our Privacy Policies apply to each of them as described on this page.

## What We Request From Website Visitors

There are instances on our primary company website, [http://www.enphaseenergy.com](http://www.enphaseenergy.com/), where we ask you to provide personal information such as name, address, phone number, email address, and similar information. This type of information will improve your website experience or allow us to follow-up with you after you visit our site.

Our primary company website’s contact form requires you to give us contact information, including email addresses, telephone numbers, and other personal contact information. We use customer contact information from the form to send you information about our company and its products and services. Your contact information will also be used to contact you when necessary.

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe in the email.

## What We Request From Remote Monitoring Service Customers

We also have a separate remote monitoring website, [http://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com](http://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/), which also may be accessed from our primary company website. Website visitors’ requests for information about monitoring service and our products which originate on this separate website are directed back to our primary company website and information is collected as we do for all information requests from the primary website, as described above.

Our remote monitoring website uses an order form for our customers to register monitoring service received as part of equipment purchases and to purchase additional remote monitoring and related services from Enphase Energy. Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about our company and its products and services.

For our customers who order remote monitoring services, we make those services available on a subscription basis. Our responses to requests for information about our monitoring service and the remote monitoring service itself are Internet-based. We obtain information from you when you inquire about the services we offer, when you initially register for the service, and when you purchase additional monitoring services from us, as described below.

## Initial Registration

If you are registering the initial monitoring service which you received when you purchased Enphase equipment, we obtain the following information from you: first and last names, a password, a valid email address as a log-in, and equipment site address. Your equipment installer may also be asked to provide certain technical information to Enphase, such as a solar array map of your solar energy system, to enable us to better provide you with the energy monitoring service; by registering for the monitoring service, you consent to Enphase obtaining technical information about your solar energy system and its installation from your equipment installer. This information may be collected by a third party on your behalf, such as your distributor or installer. This third party personal information will only be used for the purpose for which it was collected.

We also supplement your address with geo-location coordinates to perform the function of the service.

## Purchase of Additional Monitoring Services

If you purchase additional monitoring services from us, in addition to the information we collect on Initial Registration, we also will obtain from you a billing address and a valid credit card or other payment information to process payment for services ordered.

## Remote Monitoring Information Collected Automatically

The monitoring service itself includes an automated, Internet-based process of receiving transmissions from the Enphase Energy monitoring equipment about your solar equipment, its approximate location based on IP address, its output, efficiency, and other variables. This information is recorded and preserved by Enphase Energy on our company computer storage facilities, and may be accessed by you, if you subscribe to our remote monitoring service, and by us whether or not you subscribe to that Service. The Enphase Envoy/Energy Management Unit (“EMU”), once connected to the Internet, immediately begins reporting this information to Enphase Energy and will continue to do so as long as the EMU is connected to the Internet. By having your Enphase Energy EMU connected to the Internet, you consent to this automatic information reporting. We retain this information indefinitely, and we may use it for any purpose, in our sole discretion, including but not limited to quality assurance, engineering performance comparisons, and product improvements. If you purchase our remote monitoring service, you may also choose to provide others with access to this information, including the installation company which installed and/or which services your solar energy equipment.

## Additional Information Requested from Monitoring Service Customers

From time to time, we also may ask you, if you are a remote monitoring service customer, to complete surveys or answer questions regarding your satisfaction with any Enphase Energy products you have purchased and services you have received from us. We use this information to improve our services to our remote monitoring service customers. We retain this information indefinitely.

We may also ask you, as one of our remote monitoring services customers, whether you would be willing to have information about your experience with our products and services used in our company’s marketing to other potential customers. We will ask you to separately agree to this use of some of this information, and you will have to “opt-in” to this use of your information. The information which we will use in marketing will not identify you by name or address, but will instead use only the general geographic location (city or town and state), comments from you, the physical performance data from your solar equipment installation which is stored on our computer storage facilities and other site-specific information as approved by you. In addition, as described above, we may use and disclose anonymized data transmitted automatically by your Enphase EMU for any purpose. Any and all of this information may be aggregated with information from other customers or provided individually as an example of customer experience with our products. We retain such information indefinitely.

Because our remote monitoring services are provided online and may be paid for by credit card (or by other means which we approve), by necessity we provide some of your information to third parties. We contract with other companies and individuals to assist us in performing certain functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments, sending postal mail and email, analyzing data, and providing marketing assistance. They only have access to personal information necessary to perform their functions, may not use it for other purposes, and must process the information in strict compliance with applicable law.

## Modification of Account Information

Our remote monitoring website permits you, after you have logged on, to modify your account information, including address, email address, telephone number, and similar information.

## Information Collected Automatically

When you access both of our websites, we may automatically (i.e., not by registration) collect non-personal data (for example, the type of Internet browser and operating system used, domain name of the website from which you came to our website, number of visits, average time spent on the page, pages viewed). We use this information to improve the visitor experience to our website.

We also may use your Internet address (“Internet Protocol address” or “IP address”) and other information collected automatically to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website.

In addition, as described above, your Enphase Energy EMU when connected to the Internet automatically reports information to us about your solar equipment, its output, efficiency, and other variables, whether or not you subscribe to Enphase Energy remote monitoring services. We may use this information for any purpose, in our sole discretion, as described above.

## Cookies

A Cookie is a text-only string of characters that is temporarily stored in your computer’s memory. Our Cookies are time-sensitive, and automatically expire. If the expiration of a Cookie is set to be longer than the time you spend on a site, then this text-only string is saved in a Cookie on your computer’s hard drive for future reference, otherwise it disappears from your computer when your browser is closed. The Cookies we use cannot retrieve information from your computer’s hard drive, cannot destroy files, and cannot send viruses to your computer.

When a Cookie is placed on your computer’s hard drive, it does not allow access to your personal information, but it may be used to identify your computer. Enphase Energy uses Cookies to track the pages on our website that a user visits, so that information can be customized to the visitor for each session on our website, and so that future visits may be enhanced. Cookies on our website are not linked to personal information. This is a quick and convenient method of keeping our website’s content fresh and relevant to the website visitor.

Most web browsers give you the ability to prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, to have the browser notify you when you receive a new Cookie, and to disable Cookies entirely. You can still review our website if you set your browser to refuse all Cookies, but you must enable Cookies to register and make purchases on our websites.

## Third party Tracking Technologies

We contract with selected marketing specialist companies to help us track the effectiveness of our website. In conjunction with Cookies, we use Web Beacons to monitor web site traffic generated from various forms of advertising, or to track site traffic. A Web Beacon is a graphic on a web page designed to track pages viewed and messages opened. Web Beacons are often invisible, because they are generally only one pixel by one pixel in size. When a user requests an Enphase Energy web page, the Web Beacon is retrieved/activated. Once retrieved/activated, the Web Beacon can pass along to our contracted marketing specialist companies information such as the IP address of the computer that requested the page, the time the page containing the Web Beacon was viewed and for how long, and the type of browser that retrieved the page. This information is compiled by our marketing specialist companies and made available to us. Web Beacons, together with Cookies, enable us to enhance your experience on our websites and improve the effectiveness of our advertising. Our contracted marketing specialist companies are not permitted to use this information for any purpose other than the functions which they perform for us.

Some of our business partners use cookies and other tracking technologies on our site (images, scripts and frames). Data collected by these technologies are only collected in the aggregate. We have no access to or control over these cookies.

## Protection of Information From Loss, Misuse or Alteration

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
