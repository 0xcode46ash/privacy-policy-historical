As a general rule, [Environment Australia](http://www.ea.gov.au/) does not collect Personal Information* about you when you visit the site. You can generally visit the site without revealing Personal Information*, unless you choose to provide such information. The information received depends upon what you do when visiting the site. 

## Site visit data

Environment Australia makes a record of your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes: 

  * your server's address 
  * the name of the top-level domain from which you access the Internet (for example, .gov, .com, .au, .nz, etc) 
  * the date and time of the visit to the site 
  * the pages accessed and documents downloaded 
  * the previous Internet address from which you linked directly to the Environment Australia site. 



We will not identify users or their browsing activities, except where a law enforcement agency (or other government agency) may exercise a legal authority to inspect the ISP logs (eg by warrant, subpoena or notice to produce). 

This Website contains links to other sites. Environment Australia is not responsible for the content and the privacy practices of other web sites and encourages you to examine each site's privacy policy and make your own decisions regarding the accuracy, reliability and correctness of material and information found.
