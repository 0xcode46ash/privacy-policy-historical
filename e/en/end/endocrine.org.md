### Collection and Use of Information

We will not collect personal identifying information from you without your knowledge.

The Endocrine Society will use the personal identifying information that we collect to contact you in the future.

  * NO OUTSIDE DISTRIBUTION (please do not disclose my name or address on a commercial mailing list)
  * NO EMAIL (please do not include me in lists for Society email correspondence)
  * NO MAIL (please do not include me on any internal promotional Endocrine Society mailings or on any commercial mailing lists)



Notwithstanding any of the above, we may release membership lists or personal identifying information if we determine that release is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our contractual rights or obligations, to protect the rights, property, or safety of The Endocrine Society, our members, or others, or to establish a legal claim or defense.
