### Privacy Statement

Thank you for visiting The Endocrine Society Web site. We respect the privacy of our users, and have created this privacy statement in order to apprise you of our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to modify this information at any time, so please check back periodically for our latest privacy practices.

### Collection and Use of Information

#### Personal Identifying Information

Personal identifying information is your name, street or e-mail address, phone number or any other information which, when used by itself or with other data, might identify you individually. The Endocrine Society does not collect this information from you on this Website, except where you send it to us voluntarily. For example, when you order materials from us online, we will ask you for personal identifying information so that we can contact you. We will not collect personal identifying information from you without your knowledge.

The Endocrine Society will use the personal identifying information that we collect to contact you in the future. Specifically, we will send promotional e-mails notifying you of events, products and services, significant developments, or other information that we believe might be of interest. We will not disclose your e-mail address to third parties.

The Endocrine Society will rent to third parties the names and mailing addresses that it gathers (but not e-mail addresses or phone numbers). These third parties may subsequently contact you by mail.

If you do not wish to have your personal identifying information used or disclosed for these purposes, you may "opt-out." To do so, please contact us at [societyservices@endocrine.org](mailto:societyservices@endocrine.org). In your e-mail, please indicate one of the following opt-out choices:

  * NO OUTSIDE DISTRIBUTION (please do not disclose my name or address on a commercial mailing list)
  * NO EMAIL (please do not include me in lists for Society email correspondence)
  * NO MAIL (please do not include me on any internal promotional Endocrine Society mailings or on any commercial mailing lists)



Notwithstanding any of the above, we may release membership lists or personal identifying information if we determine that release is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our contractual rights or obligations, to protect the rights, property, or safety of The Endocrine Society, our members, or others, or to establish a legal claim or defense.

#### Continuing Medical Education (CME)

The Endocrine Society will record learner's personal information as provided on CME evaluations to allow for issuance and tracking of CME certificates. The Endocrine Society may also track aggregate responses to questions in activities and evaluations and use these data to inform the ongoing evaluation and improvement of its CME program. No individual performance data or any other personal information collected from evaluations will be shared with third parties.

#### Non-Personal Information
