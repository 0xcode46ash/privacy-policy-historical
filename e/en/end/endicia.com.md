  1. **WHEN THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES.   If a Service you're using links to this Privacy Policy, this Policy applies to you.**

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to our sites, products, and services (collectively, "Services") that link to this Policy. Endicia is the controller of all Personal Information subject to this Policy for our Services.

  2. **WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION. We want to be clear about what information we collect and how we use it to deliver our Services to you, operate our business, and help make our Services useful, and work better for you. We do not sell or share your Personal Information with third parties for their own commercial uses, if you have opted out of such sharing.**

**a) Types of Information We Collect.** In connection with accessing our Services, we may collect information from you which can be used to identify you ("Personal Information"), such as your name, shipping/billing address, email address, phone, username and password.

We collect information when you register or open an account, sign in, pay a bill, purchase a Service, call us for support, or give us feedback. We may also get information from other companies or third parties, such as when you sync a third party account or service with your Endicia Account, or when we may use service providers to supplement the Personal Information you give us (e.g., validate your mailing address) to help us maintain the accuracy of your data and provide you with better service.

We may also automatically collect certain usage information when you access our Services ("Usage Data"), such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, log files, unique device identifiers, pages viewed, browser type, any links you click on to leave or interact with our Services, and other usage information collected from cookies and other tracking technologies. For example, we collect IP addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information, such as using IP addresses to monitor the regions from which users navigate to our Services. We may also collect IP addresses from users when they log into the Services as part of our log-in and security features. We may also, when you enable location-based Services, collect Global Positioning System (GPS) location data and/or motion data.
