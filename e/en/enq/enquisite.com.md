# Enquisite Search Trends — Search Engine Position Reports — Privacy Policy

* * *

## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices of Enquisite Reporting, a wholly owned property of RJ Research Inc. ("Enquisite"). It is intended to inform our customers and visitors to our customers' websites, about Enquisite's data collection and usage relating to information we process through Enquisite Software and Enquisite Reports (collectively referred to as "Enquisite Products").

If you install or use Enquisite Products, you are subject to this Privacy Policy and Software License & Terms Of Service And Conditions Of Use, including, but not limited to the limitations on damages, and application of the law of the Province of British Columbia. 

As our business changes, our Privacy Policy will also change, and we reserve the right to change how we handle the information we process on behalf of our customers. If you use Enquisite Products, you should check our website frequently to see recent changes. If a material change has been made to our Privacy Policy, we may also notify our registered users via e-mail of such material changes. 

**What does Enquisite Products do?**

We provide web site data analysis services based on information provided by our customers regarding interactions visitors have on their websites. We use this data to create trend reports (“Enquisite Reports”) which analyze search engine traffic patterns. If you are unsure what these reports look like, or what information is contained within them, please review the [training document](http://enquisite.com/enquisite-metrics-train.pps "This is a PowerPoint presentation - 1.64 M"). 

**What Information Does Enquisite Collect From Its Customers and How Is That Data Used?**

Enquisite's customers are businesses, not individuals. Enquisite collects contact and related information from our customers and prospective customers who request information or services from Enquisite or who register for Enquisite Products. To the extent that any personal contact information is collected, we use this contact information for business purposes, such as responding to requests for information about Enquisite Products and services, providing access to certain services, and for registration of Enquisite Products. 

By submitting your information to us and by installing and/or using the Enquisite Products, you are consenting to our use of your data as described herein and are consenting to the Software License & Terms Of Service And Conditions Of Use. If you do not consent, you should not register with Enquisite and you should not install and/or use the Enquisite Products. 

**What Information Does Enquisite Collect Through Enquisite Products From Visitors to Its Customers' Websites, and How Is That Data Used?**

Upon confirmation of sign up, Enquisite provides a Javascript for our customers to embed into their websites. The Javascript data initiates electronic image requests for a single-pixel gif, also known as an action tag or web beacon, which is a small graphic image on a web page designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a site. The image is used to count web page accesses and gather some general statistical information, such as the IP address of a visitor's computer, the URL of the page the tag comes from and the time it was viewed, log files and other traffic data, such as referring search engine name, rank on the page, search query initiated and browser used (collectively referred to as “statistical data”). We do not collect any personally identifiable information from visitors to our customers' websites. 

The statistical data collected is processed by Enquisite to produce Enquisite Reports which aggregate the data collected for our customers. 

Enquisite requests that its customers adopt privacy policies that fully inform visitors to the customers' websites about the customers' installation and use of the Enquisite Products and the collection of statistical data from their visitors. Enquisite customers must also represent that this data collection does not violate any laws, confidentiality or other obligations between customers and their visitors. 

**Is Information Shared With Third Parties?**

Enquisite does not sell, share, or distribute any private or personal information with any third parties. 

We may however employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include registering users, sending postal mail and email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service. To perform these functions, these companies and individuals may have access to information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Enquisite or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 

We may also release information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Software License & Terms Of Service And Conditions Of Use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Enquisite, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection. 

**How Can I Access and Update My Customer Information?**
