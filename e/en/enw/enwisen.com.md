## Scope and Consent

Each time you access this Site, you are consenting to the information practices described in this Privacy Policy. You accept this Privacy Policy when you purchase, access, or use the products or services offered on this Site. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a revised version on this Site. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it. Therefore, we encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to remain informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. If we make any material changes, we will provide notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective.

Infor honors your choices. You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional emails, SMS messages, telephone calls and postal mail from us by using the Opt out methods described below (see "How You Can Opt Out of Marketing Communications"). If we determine that your explicit consent is needed, we will obtain that consent before or at the time of data collection.

## Privacy Shield

Infor, which includes its respective successors, subsidiaries, divisions and groups, complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.  Infor has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

Infor is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, and under Privacy Shield, we may subsequently transfer that data to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. Infor complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Infor is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Infor may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>. 

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [[https://www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/)], you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. 

## Other Important Information

You acknowledge (a) that you are accessing a website that is based in the United States, (b) that you are providing personal information to a company in the United States, and (c) that Infor must adhere to laws of the United States. You agree that personal information collected on our Site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Infor, its affiliates, partners, service providers, or agents maintain facilities, and while in such jurisdictions may be subject to access pursuant to the laws of those jurisdictions. Each of these countries has different privacy laws that afford varying levels of protection for your personal information, and such laws may be less stringent or may not be as comprehensive as those laws that exist in your country. 

**By using our Site, you consent to Infor and its affiliates’ transmission and processing of your personal information in any jurisdiction in which we operate, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.**

In connection with our processing, we may transfer personal information to group entities or companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Customers. If you are a customer or end user of one of our Customers (i.e., the company with whom you do business, are employed by, or occasionally interact) and you would no longer like to be contacted by that company, then please contact that company directly. 

## How We Use the Personal information We Collect

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, smooth, and efficient visitor and customer experience. We may also use your personal information to:

  * distribute alerts concerning product upgrades, special offers, updated information, and other new products and services from Infor or our partners;
  * share relevant information with affiliates and third-parties; or
  * for such other purposes as required or permitted by law. 



## How We Share Personal information with Third Parties

Infor partners with and occasionally hires other companies to provide services on its behalf. Personal information may be shared with these companies; however, the use and amount of personal information shared is limited to the purpose for collection. These third parties are required to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

We may also share your information as follows: 

  * with your consent;
  * and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or property; to protect your safety or the safety of others; to investigate fraud or respond to a government, judicial or other legal request; to comply with the law; or in connection with a corporate change, such as an acquisition or merger. 



## How We Protect and Store Personal information

We endeavor to protect the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to try to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

## How We Use Tracking Technologies

Infor and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to Infor’s Customer (the data controller).
