# The english@home privacy policy

**english@home** is a free website for people who want to improve their English. Because we do not require users to login to use any section of our website, no personal information about you is collected or stored by **english@home** unless you supply it.

Newsletter subscriptions

If you sign up for our [free newsletter](http://www.english-at-home.com/news1.html), an email address is naturally required. An email address given to us in this way is always treated securely. All data is accessible only by designated **english@home** staff and is not available to anyone outside the organisation. 

We hate junk email as much as you do - your email address will **never** be passed to anyone else, and will only be used to send you the **english@home** newsletter once a month. You can permanently remove your email address from our subscriber list at any time by going to our [unsubscribe page](http://www.english-at-home.com/unsubscribe.html). A link to this page is included with every issue of our newsletter.

Our secure mailing system means other subscribers to our newsletter cannot obtain any details of fellow subscribers from the newsletter that they receive.

FAQ section

We're always curious to know where our site visitors are, which is why we ask for your name and where you live if you send a question to our[ FAQ Section](http://www.english-at-home.com/faq/index.html). **This information is optional**. If you do fill in this information, we may place it next to your question in the FAQ section. Only your name and broad location will be used. For example, "Nadine from Naples, Italy, writes....".

If you contact us directly with a question, rather than via the FAQ section, we will not use any information contained in your email on the FAQ pages unless you give us permission.

All other correspondence is treated with similar discretion.

Site statistics

Like most websites, **english@home** tracks very general information about visitors to our website. This data includes which brand of browser you're using, the country you're from and which website referred you to our site.

Almost every website has such a system in place. Personal data such as your name, email address, exact location, etc. is not available to us.

"Cookies"

A _cookie_ is a small text file which may be temporarily stored on your computer when you visit some websites. They are most commonly used for helping websites with visitor statistics, or for personalising content.

The **english@home** site itself does not use cookies. The banner ads placed at the top of our pages are sent to your browser directly from **Burst Media** , which may occasionally use cookies. Again, their system is only used for very general information such as described above. Like us, **Burst Media** prides itself on its privacy policy, which you can [view on their website](http://www.burstmedia.com/).

If you have any further questions on our privacy policy, feel free to contact us: [office@english-at-home.com](mailto:office@english-at-home.com).
