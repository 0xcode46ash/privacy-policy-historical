# english@home privacy policy

**english@home** is a free website for people who want to improve their English. Because we do not require users to login to use any section of our website, no personal information about you is collected or stored by **english@home** unless you supply it.

Newsletter subscriptions

If you sign up for our [free newsletter](http://www.english-at-home.com/news1.html), an email address is naturally required. An email address given to us is always treated securely. All data is accessible only by designated **english@home** staff and is not available to anyone outside the organisation. 

We hate junk email as much as you do - your email address will **never** be passed to anyone else, and will only be used to send you the **english@home** newsletter twice a month. You can permanently remove your email address from our subscriber list at any time by emailing [subscriptions@english-at-home.com](mailto:subscriptions@english-at-home.com). This information is included with every issue of our newsletter.

Our secure mailing system means other subscribers to our newsletter cannot obtain any details of fellow subscribers from the newsletter that they receive.

Site statistics

Like most websites, **english@home** tracks very general information about visitors to our website. This data includes which brand of browser you're using, the country you're from and which website referred you to our site.

Almost every website has such a system in place. Personal data such as your name, email address, exact location, etc. is not available to us.

"Cookies"

A _cookie_ is a small text file which may be temporarily stored on your computer when you visit websites. They are most commonly used for helping websites with visitor statistics, or for personalising content.

**english@home** only uses cookies in the Help Me! Forums. These cookies are used to store your password (if you've chosen to become a registered member) or to let you know which messages are new since your last visit to the Help Me! Forums. The cookies contain no data which could be used to identify you personally.

**Burst Media** , who are responsible for the banner ads at the top of our pages, may occasionally use cookies. Again, their system is only used for very general information such as described above. Like us, **Burst Media** prides itself on its privacy policy, which you can [view on their website](http://www.burstmedia.com/).

If you have any further questions on our privacy policy, feel free to [email](http://www.english-at-home.com/email.html) us.
