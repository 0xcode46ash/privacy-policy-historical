## Testimonials

Dear Mr. Les Perras,

At first, thanks a lot for your exciting website.

I am Swiss and I am "not a young student" (51 years old - a half of a century but I feel much younger... ).

Nonetheless, I hope I still can improve my English skills. Unfortunately, I have a big “gap between receptive and productive competence” and much more.  
Your website is great, congratulation.

All the phrasal verbs and idioms make the (my) life much more difficult (Swiss German is easier to learn, believe me...).

Once again, thank you very much for your effort.

All the best from Olten, Switzerland

Dear Les,

I am Sean, now I am studying in Canada. After comparing different English study website for a while, I gradually tend to be fond of your study skill, now, I have practiced for almost one month, according to your guide, it takes me one or two hours to repeat over and over again, and now, it is an obviously feeling that I have made a progress in my listening, it dose work!

But sometimes I also feel the best efficient actually show up during the period when I just finish shadowing approximately half days, if there`s no too many strange new vocabularies, I can catch on a short news! This is very exciting! Then after that, the difficult status which led to me hardly understand whatever others said restored again. I dont know why, it`s sucks. maybe I need consolidate the result I have gained.

Anyway, thank you Les, I found a nice way to study it!

the best regards

Hi! my name is Lucy. I'm come from Vietnam. I know your site when googling a way to learn phrasal verbs. now, I am working on a thesis about phrasal verbs. and I want to introduce this source(your website) to my student. And I want this material including in my thesis, in order for my students easily to access the wonderful source of learning. It is really highly apprecited to receive your help in this sincerely yours, Lucy

Thank you for your help in editing our stories. My question is : Do we have to use phrasal verbs in writing stories or any story is acceptable for  
you. Regards,  


hi.thats my pleasure to have some english listining file practicaly 4 my improvment. tanks a lot.

hello and thank you very much for this wesite do you advise me to listen to english radion without understand the words

Dear sir, It is very useful to write a short stories, each story contains a few or many phrasal verbs repeated many times in the same meaning .  
This way is very helpful to us to remind them easily and quickly and motivate us to go on in studying phrasal verbs. Thank you for giving a time to read my message.

Dear Sir First of all I want to say you that this is one of the most useful English website for learners I have seen. Fhrasal verbs and idioms are  
very hard to memorize, but using it to write stories is easier to assimilate it, specially having feedback, as in this case. This is a great way to motivate foreigners studants and to make them fell more confident. I know that it would be much more interesting if there was other ideas or styles of writing. But unfortunately, most people do not like to write or are afraid of making mistakes, and thus, are losing this opportunity to learn.... 

...Best regards

Thank you very much. You web site is really interesting and I will continue to use it... By writing a text, and you creating the listening from it, I can have a more focus and well shaped listening for my students. That's wonderful!

Best regard
