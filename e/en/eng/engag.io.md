**ENGAGIO PRIVACY POLICY**

**1\. Data Collection & Usage** 

**Upon registration** : Name, e-mail, social signons usernames.

**Additional information** : We pull in the following information from your social networks including basic account info IF it is made available and permitted by your privacy settings on the originating network (name, gender, email, birthday, current city, profile picture/avatar), comments and recent activity. ** **

**Purpose** : The information collected is used to personalize your experience, suggest new content, improve the website and service, and to organize and update your contact records in the Engagio account. That said, we haven’t used the gender, birthday and city, and we don’t have current plans to use these parameters. We use your email to send you a daily list of Popular Articles that your friends are engaging in, as well as occasional notifications that someone at Engagio is interested in contacting you. When doing that, we don’t reveal your email to them. We may send occasional emails to inform you of new services, to respond to your questions, comments, requests and/or complaints for the purpose of improving the customer service. When sending emails, we use Amazon SES or MailChimp, two authenticated SMTP mail services. We adhere to both MailChimp and Amazon Web Service’s Acceptable Use Policy.

**Display of information** : Most of the information that you provide to us is information you have already made public. This includes messages and their associated metadata such as time of posting, people you follow and many other bits of information. The online pubic information that you provide is made available to other Engagio users or visitors. Your private messages and/or email are shared privately to the recipients you specify and are not made available to any other users.

**Cookies:** Similar to most other websites, we send cookies to your computer to uniquely identify your browser which in turns help us improve our service. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing a site. You may select to disable or block cookies set by Engagio or any other website by changing your browser settings.

**2\. Data Sharing  
** We do not and will not sell, trade or transfer to outside parties your personal identifiable information. Although our service incorporates services from third parties websites such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, StockTwits, AngelList, YouTube, StackExchange and Foursquare, we do not pass any of your information from one service to another. The passwords you have on these third party accounts are not stored on our servers. We use an authentication token to verify your username.

**3\. Opt-Out Policy  
** All automated email correspondence from Engagio includes a one-click unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email body. If you do not feel content is appropriate for you, or if you have subscribed in error, please use the one-click unsubscribe link to remove your subscription from our mailing list. 

Additionally, all automated email notifications from Engagio can be managed from your account settings: <http://engag.io/settings/notifications>.

**4\. Account Deletion  
** In the event you close your account, we will no longer identify you as an Engagio user, but we may still continue to collect your other public information to the extent that you are interacting with another Engagio user. We may still keep some information related to your account for recordkeeping integrity, but due to the complexities of the technology involved, we cannot guarantee total or irrevocable deletion of your account information, and we cannot provide you with any specific timelines for deletion.

**5\. Protection of Personal Information  
** We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized Engagio employees and some third party consultants who have agreed to be bound by our strict confidentiality restrictions may be permitted partial access to some Personal Information, but they may do so only for permitted business or technical testing purposes. In addition, we use SSL encryption in the transmission of your sensitive Personal Information between your system and ours, and we use firewall services and other security levels to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your Personal Information.

**6\. Changes to Policy  
** We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post changes on this page: http://www.engag.io/about/privacy.

**Versioning  
** This policy was last modified on September 17 2012. For any questions or inquiries, please email us at support@engag.io
