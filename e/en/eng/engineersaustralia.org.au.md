# Engineers Australia - Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

Engineers Australia is an organisation that is, by nature, personal information-intensive. It relies on comprehensive and accurate personal information about its members and other people with whom we deal. We have robust systems and procedures in place to protect your privacy whenever we collect, store, use or disclose your personal information. If you do not wish us to disclose information about you to third parties, you must inform us and we will take immediate steps to implement your request.

 **What kind of personal information do we collect?**

The type of information Engineers Australia collects and holds includes (but is not limited to) personal information, including sensitive information, about:

* Members' official and preferred names, titles, postnominals, personal awards, private and business address details, telephone and facsimile contact details both private and business, e-mail addresses, date of birth, gender.

* Members' qualifications, education and academic history, work experience and skills, occupation, employer information, insurance details, areas of practice, areas of interest, details of disciplinary action. 

* Membership of Technical Societies, Colleges, Registers and Special Interest Groups. 

* Financial details including credit card numbers, bank account information, financial status of membership, and subscriptions to Engineers Australia publications.

* Assessment records created when a member applies for a certain membership grade. This can include Curriculum Vitaes (CVs), Engineering Practice Reports (EPRs) Competency Demonstration Reports (CDRs) and Overseas Qualification Assessments (OSQAs).

 **How we collect your personal information**

We collect most personal information direct from you - for example, when you fill in an application form including an admission, readmission, concession or direct debit form, a qualifications assessment or Chartered Status assessment application form. Information may also be collected direct from you when you deal with us personally, over the telephone, send a letter, or visit the web site. 

Information is collected from you when you nominate for an award, are invited to the grade of Fellow or Honorary Fellow, or elect for a position on National Congress, Council, a Committee or constituent group. Information is also collected from you when you participate in an Engineers Australia survey.

There may be occasions when a third party provides information about you, such as when you are nominated for an honour or award, or when a complaint is made against you. 

**How we use your personal information**

We will use personal information it collects for the primary purpose for which it is collected and for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose and are reasonably expected, or for which consent has been given. 

We will use your personal information to provide you with a particular product or service and to contact you about matters pertaining to membership of the Institution. This includes (but is not limited to) the following: 

* Assessing membership applications, Chartered status applications and migration assessments.

* Processing payments of applications and assessments.

* Making decisions relating to nomination or election to a position on Council/National Congress. 

* Providing membership services such as Engineers Australia Magazine, e-News, and other member benefits.

* Inviting you to partake in Division events, technical seminars, professional development activities and networking activities.

* Contacting board/ panel and committee members to distribute agendas and minutes.

We may use your personal information for purposes related or ancillary to the main reason we collect it, such as: 

* Internal accounting and administration.  
* Regulatory reporting and compliance.  
* Helping us to identify and inform you about other services that may be of benefit to you.

In the event of a complaint against you we use personal information provided to us to investigate the complaint in accordance with the procedures set down in the Institution's Disciplinary Regulations and the Manual of Investigation and Disciplinary Procedures.

 **Disclosure of your personal information**

Engineers Australia may disclose personal information, including sensitive information, held about an individual to:

* A membership committee/ board or panel to assess applications and disciplinary action.

* Members authorised to vote on candidates elected to office bearing positions judging committees for awards and honours.

* National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition (NOOSR) for migration statistical reporting under the NOOSR/ Institution contract.

* Members on the same Committee or group.

We disclose a member's mailing details (i.e. name and address) to our wholly owned subsidiary companies, Engineers Australia Pty Ltd (EA) for the purpose of mailing to you the monthly Engineers Australia magazine. We also disclose member's mailing details to Engineering Education Australia Pty Ltd (EEA) for the purpose of mailing training and education course information to you.

The magazine subsidiary, on behalf of Engineers Australia, sells the mailing list to commercial providers of goods or services that are deemed to be of benefit or interest to engineers. 

We may contract out some of our functions and activities. For example, we may disclose information to allow printing of renewal invoices, membership cards, and arrears notices. We may also provide names and addresses to a mailing house to mail information to you. In these situations, we prohibit the third parties from using personal information about you except for the specific purpose for which we supply it.

Engineers Australia makes certain registers and lists publicly available. For instance, if you are recorded on a register or other listing, such as the National Professional Engineers Register (NPER) or the National Engineering Technologists Register (NETR) as an accredited arbitrator, mediator or conciliator, or if you are an office bearer on Council, National Congress, a committee, or panel, we disclose personal information such as name and contact details through various means, either through publications, websites or verbally to members of the public.

Engineers Australia discloses to the public that you are a member of the Institution unless you have advised us that you do not want this information released. 

We treat all personal information held about you as confidential. This applies except where disclosure of your personal information is compelled by law, in the public interest, or with your consent.

In the event of a complaint, disclosure of personal information is restricted to those authorised under the Disciplinary Regulations and Manual of Investigation and Procedures. 

**Accuracy of your personal information**

If we have accurate personal information about you, it enables us to provide you with the best possible service. We take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete and up to date whenever we collect or use it. 

If you find that current personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date please contact us immediately. Alternatively, you may correct this yourself through the Members Zone on our website. 

**Access to your personal information**

You may access limited personal information through our secure Members Zone on our website. Alternatively, on request, we provide you with information about you which is readily accessible and which may lawfully be provided. Your request to provide information will be dealt with in a reasonable time and we may charge you an administration fee for retrieving and sending the information to you. 

**Security of your personal information**

Engineers Australia protects any personal information that we hold about you from misuse and loss. We protect your privacy by restricting access to your personal information to those staff or authorised office bearers who need it, either to process information or to provide you with the services you have asked for. Our staff are responsible for handling personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act.

Your personal information may be stored in hardcopy documents, as electronic data, or in our software or systems. We maintain physical security over our paper and electronic data stores and premises. We also maintain computer and network security. For example, we use firewalls (security measures for the Internet) and other security systems such as user identifiers and passwords to control access to computer systems.

Engineers Australia will keep your information for as long as it is needed to provide you with the products and services you have requested from us. We will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information when we no longer need it.

Our online applications available to members through the members zone undergo extensive security testing by external professional companies to ensure your data is protected to the highest level against potential hacking. All data transmitted between web browsers and our online applications are protected by 128-bit encryption.

If you believe that the privacy of your personal information has been compromised, you are entitled to complain. If you have a complaint, contact the area where you believe the breach has occurred. If your complaint is not resolved to your satisfaction, forward a written complaint to: 

The Chief Executive
