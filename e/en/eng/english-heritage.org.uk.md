## Policy Overview

We collect personal information from our supporters who use our website; from visitors to our historic sites; supporters who apply to become Members, make a purchase or donation and from those who get in touch with us directly. We do this both electronically and in paper format.

In addition we also collect details automatically about the pages you visit on our website. Please see our Cookies policy below for more information.

In choosing to share your personal information with us, you will be agreeing to our collection and use of your information as described in this policy.

If you no longer want us to process your personal details you can ask us to stop at any time by contacting [data.protection@english-heritage.org.uk](mailto:data.protection@english-heritage.org.uk).

We use the information you share with us to:

  * Make sure you receive the product, service or information you have requested or bought
  * Carry out reasonable administration of your membership, donations, bookings, volunteering and other services
  * To keep in touch with you in the way that you want us to
  * To better understand our supporters so that we can personalise and improve the services we offer



For details of how we do this please see the full policy below.

We will need to make changes to this policy from time to time, to make sure that we are always providing you the latest information about what is happening to your personal information.

This policy was last updated on 22/05/2018.

## What Information do we collect and how?

We collect personal information about you that helps us to deliver and improve our services. This includes:

  * Name and address
  * Email address and telephone numbers
  * Date of birth
  * Payment information such as credit card and bank details
  * How you would like to hear from us
  * English Heritage historic sites you have visited
  * Details of purchases, membership, Gift Aid Declarations, donations and gifts in your will
  * Details of job applications and your volunteering activity
  * Enquiries and feedback
  * Interaction with our social media pages



Under our membership scheme we also ask for details of your children who you would like to include on the membership. We use this information to better understand how to provide the best service to your family in terms of offers and events, and we will not contact your children directly.

If you have provided details for someone else, for example by buying a gift for them, we will not contact that person until they have been given the opportunity to let us know their communication preferences.

If you have contacted us on behalf of an organisation, for example making an Educational Booking or a Travel Trade enquiry, we will also store details of your employer.

When visiting our website we also collect information about your IP address and the pages you visit. This helps us to understand which areas of our website are most useful to our supporters and make improvements. This does not tell us who you are and where you live until you choose to provide us with that information. Please see our Cookies policy below for more information.

For a small number of people, where we want to better understand the interest of individuals in supporting the work of English Heritage, we may seek information about their interests and preferences before contacting them, but only if we feel there is a legitimate interest to do so.  The information we gather may relate to: career and business networks, voluntary roles including trusteeships, residential location, family (not including information about children unless given personally or made public by the individual concerned), wealth and assets, hobbies and interests and previous philanthropy.  We use this information to improve our understanding of individuals’ interests and preferences. We will contact these few individuals to notify them of our privacy policy no later than one month following collection of data relating to them.

We may use a number of sources to carry out our work, including printed and online newspapers and publications, charity and company websites, and the websites of organisations similar to us. From time to time we may use specialist companies to help us identify individuals who we think might be interested in supporting us and the work we do. This will only be done when individuals give permission to the relevant third party organisations to share the data they hold on them, or if the data is already publicly available.

## What do we do with your information?

**PROCESSING**

We will make sure that you receive the product or service you have requested, process any payments and send you information relating to that service.

If you have joined as a Member this will include sending you confirmation of your purchase and membership materials such as membership cards, information on how to use your membership, regular magazines, handbook and email newsletters. We will also send you information about membership renewal and information relating to your Direct Debit payments.

If you have made a donation, this will include thanking you for your support and letting you know how your contribution has helped us.

We will also do our best to keep your information up to date. This includes monitoring returned mail to let us know if you no longer live at the address we hold for you. We also use information from the Post Office's National Change of Address database, the telephone preference service, the mailing preference service, the Bereavement Register and other similar suppression lists to make sure we do not send communications to the wrong place or person.

Please do let us know if your details have changed.

**MARKETING AND COMMUNICATIONS**

Receiving marketing information from English Heritage will always be your choice, and you can choose how you would like to receive that information from us.

You can also change your mind at any time, and we will keep your preferences up to date.

We limit the number of marketing communications we send to make sure we are not sending you too much. The maximum you would receive is four per month, in addition to communications that are not marketing related described above.

We may at times invite you to events for fundraising, or ask you if you are able to support us further but only if appropriate and in line with this privacy policy.  
We will only contact you for marketing purposes by telephone or text message (SMS) if you have told us we can.

We will only contact you by email if you have told us you would like to hear from us this way, or to let you know about services you have previously bought. Every email will have a link to help you unsubscribe if you wish to stop this.

We may contact you occasionally by post, however you can also stop this at anytime by contacting [data.protection@english-heritage.org.uk](mailto:data.protection@english-heritage.org.uk).

If you have applied to work for English Heritage, your personal information will only be processed for the purposes of recruitment, including processing your application and tracking recruitment statistics. You will not receive marketing communications, but you may receive job alerts by email if you have signed up to this service.

**USER SUPPORTER PROFILES**

In addition to respecting your communication preferences, we know it is important to our supporters to use our resources in a responsible and cost effective way. For this reason we use automated profiling and targeting to help us understand our supporters and make sure that:

  * Our communications and services are relevant, personalised and interesting to you
  * Our services meet the needs of our supporters
  * We only ask for further support and help from you if it is appropriate
  * We use our resources responsibly and keep our costs down



To do this we will analyse how you interact with us and use both geographic and demographic information to let you know what is happening in your local area and understand your interests.

If you have agreed that we can contact you we may also gather additional information about you from external sources, for example updates to address and contact information, or publicly available information regarding your wealth, earnings, or employment. We may use this information to assess your capacity to support us and invite you to do so. If you would prefer that this did not happen simply let us know.

This analysis may be carried out by English Heritage or by third parties organisations working for us.

We will never sell or pass on your personal information, or let other organisations use it for their own purposes.

**WHO WILL HAVE ACCESS TO MY INFORMATION?**  
Your information will be only be accessible to our staff, volunteers and contractors if they are trained and it is appropriate in order for them to carry out their role in line with this Privacy Policy.

We will never sell your personal information, or let other organisations use it for their own purposes.

We will only share your personal information where:

  * We are legally required to, or as a result of a lawful request by a governmental or law enforcement authority.
  * We have engaged a supplier or contractor to carry out services on our behalf, such as order fulfilment, sending our communications or carrying out research and analysis.



We only work with trusted suppliers who have agreed to treat your information as respectfully as we do and in accordance with data protection legislation.

Our website may contain links to other websites that are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you that will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours.

## How do we keep your information safe?

The security of your information is paramount to us. We use encryption for transfer of data and our networks are regularly monitored to ensure they remain secure.

We also regularly review our measures to ensure they are up to date and in line with latest developments, particularly when we are handling payment information. 

If you have a password to allow access to certain parts of our website, you must keep that password safe and not share it with anyone or your personal information could be at risk.

Data that is transmitted via the internet or in email, cannot be 100% secure. As a global environment, transmitting data to us may take place outside the European Economic Area.

We will take every reasonable precaution to keep your information safe but it cannot be guaranteed and so please be aware that any information you do transmit to us is at your own risk. Once we have received your information we will use our best effort to ensure its safety within our network, which sits within the European Economic Area.

We will only hold your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to carry out services and administer your relationship with us. Typically this is two years since your last interaction with us unless we are required to hold it longer for legal or taxation reasons.

If we dispose of your information it will always be done securely

## How to get in touch and understanding your rights

We want to ensure you remain in control of your personal data.  Part of this is making sure you understand your legal rights, which are as follows:

  * The right of access to a copy of the information we hold about you (this is known as a subject access request)
  * The right to have your data erased (though this will not apply where it is necessary for us to continue to use the data for a lawful reason)
  * The right to have inaccurate data rectified
  * The right to object to your data being used for marketing or profiling, and
  * Where technically feasible, you have the right to personal data you have provided to us which we process automatically on the basis of your consent or the performance of a contract.  The information will be provided in a common electronic format.



Please bear in mind that there are exemptions to the rights above and though we will always try to respond to your requests there may be situations where we are unable to do so.

If you would like further advice or information on your rights or wish to exercise them please write to the Information Governance Manager (who is our Data Protection Officer) at English Heritage Trust, The Engine House, FireFly Avenue, Swindon, SN2 2EH or email [data.protection@english-heritage.org.uk](http://data.protection@english-heritage.org.uk/)

You may wish to use our template subject access form which includes guidance on how to make your request.

If you are not happy with our response or you believe that your data protection or privacy rights have been infringed, you can complain to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office which regulates and enforces data protection law in the UK.  Details of how to do this are available at the Information Commissioner’s Office website at [www.ico.org.uk](http://www.ico.org.uk/).

## Cookies

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally. These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task.
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested.
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast.
