# Environmental News Network - About ENN

**ENN Privacy Policy**

The Environmental News Network (www.enn.com) respects and protects the privacy of our users and subscribers. We encourage other sites to join us in this effort. 

ENN will not obtain personally identifying information about you when you visit our web site unless you choose to provide such information to us. 

**What information do you collect from all visitors?**

ENN collects the name of your domain (i.e. aol.com, princeton.edu, etc.), the IP address of the machine you are sitting at or the IP address of the ISP router port through which you connected, the date and time you display a page from our site, the last page you visited before connecting to ENN and the pages you visit at our site. We use this information internally to analyze ENN web site traffic. 

**When I subscribe to your service, what do you do with that information?**

The personal information you give us at the time you subscribe to ENN Daily News is used only for billing and account maintenance. We do not give this information to anyone outside ENN. In addition, the email address you give us for billing purposes, Newswire delivery or ENN Daily News email edition delivery is used only for those purposes. We will not give our email address lists to anyone outside ENN and we will not use the email lists for any but their intended purposes. 

**What other information do you collect from visitors to ENN?**

We collect information via polls, questionnaires, surveys and threaded discussion groups. Participants in the discussion groups can remain anonymous or omit their email addresses. The other information we collect via polls and surveys is strictly confidential and is used primarily for marketing purposes, customer service and to weigh how good of a job we are doing. 

**What are cookies and how do you use them?**

A cookie is an instruction that a program running on our server places in your client cookie file for use at a later time. For example, we don't want visitors to our site biasing the results of a poll by submitting their choice 100, 200 or any number of times more than once. When you submit a poll on ENN, a cookie is placed in your client cookie file that says you have already given us your opinion. When you try to submit again, the poll software will notice the cookie on the client and tell you we already have your opinion. These cookies expire once the poll has run its course. 

Cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information and are not used to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally contained in a cookie. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, please direct them to customer service: [mgt@enn.com](mailto:mgt@enn.com).
