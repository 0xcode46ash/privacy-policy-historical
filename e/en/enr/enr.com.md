**McGraw-Hill Companies Construction Information Group Privacy Policy**  


When you register on one of our web sites, your e-mail address is added to the electronic mailing list of the business unit you were visiting so that, from time to time, we can send you information or newsletters about news, new features, additions and changes to our web site. If you provided us with any additional information while you were ordering a product, we will use this information to help us fulfill your order. Occasionally, McGraw-Hill's Construction Information Group shares data collected about subscribers with other units within the family of The McGraw-Hill Companies, whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you. Many of our subscribers find these mail promotions valuable, whether they are shopping for merchandise, taking advantage of a special offer or purchasing unique services. 

Additionally, if you are a subscriber to the Dodge Digital Plans and Specs service, we may furnish your name and address to applicable project owners and architects so that they can monitor their intellectual property rights in the applicable plans and specifications. 

We use "cookies" only to help you navigate the site. We do not gather any information on you from any cookies, nor can we gather or change any information on your computer from our cookies. 

If you gave us your credit card number, it will be used one time only to fulfill one order. We do not keep or store credit card information. The exception is for subscribers of Dodge Plans, who have submitted credit card numbers for ongoing subscriptions. 

If you would like to confirm the accuracy of the information we have collected from you, please write to [CIG_Privacy_Policy@mcgraw-hill.com](mailto:CIG_Privacy_Policy@mcgraw-hill.com). 

If you have questions about the uses we are making of any information you provide to us, you may contact:
