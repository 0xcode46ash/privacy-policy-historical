# Privacy Policy | Enfamil U.S.

Effective Date: April 20, 2011

### **Your Choices for Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

Enfamil.com allows visitors to its website to control how both personally and non-personally identifiable data from their online activities is collected. Options to "opt-out" of non-personally identifiable information collection are explained in the following section of this Privacy Policy:

  * Use of Cookies and Web Beacons



### Purpose of This Privacy Policy

Mead Johnson & Company respects the privacy of its customers, including visitors to its websites, and understands that information about you, your health, and your health care is sensitive. **Mead Johnson Nutrition will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties,** except as provided in the Transfer of Control section of this Privacy Policy. Mead Johnson Nutrition developed this Privacy Policy to provide information about our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy before submitting information or using this website. By submitting information or using this website, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy.

### **Information Voluntarily Provided by Website Visitors**

You can visit much of our website without telling us who you are or providing us with other personally identifiable information. Some areas of our website allow you to contact us to ask questions or provide comments. When you communicate with us and request a response, we ask for your name and contact information. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. Some areas of our website may also require that you submit information to access specific content, features, interactive tools, services, or participate in a particular activity. For example, to create an online account or to subscribe to an email newsletter, we may ask for your name, contact information, and perhaps additional information so we can tailor our response to your request. In addition, when you access certain interactive tools or service, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information. You may always choose not to provide the requested information, but then you may not be able to participate in the particular activity that requires the information.

### **Use, Disclosure, and Removal of Your Personally Identifiable Information That You Provide Voluntarily**

We may personalize and customize our website for certain visitors. From time to time we may ask you to respond to optional survey questions to further personalize your experience as our customer. If you provide information about yourself, you may find the website customized with references to products and/or services that we believe may be of interest to you, based on your previous interactions and information you have provided to us. If you do provide us with personally identifiable information, such as your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, or other information such as your education level, or personal medical information regarding you, your infant or your child, you agree that we may contact you through a variety of means such as postal mail, telephone, or email to provide you with information we believe may be of interest to you unless you opt-out of this service by contacting us as indicated in the Questions section of this Privacy Policy. If you enroll in a Mead Johnson Nutrition program, we may also provide your information to the service providers who help Mead Johnson Nutrition develop programs and provide services that may be of interest to you, or for information processing, postal mailing, and/or Internet-based delivery purposes. We may also share your information with other Mead Johnson Nutrition companies who might invite you to participate in one of their programs. Mead Johnson Nutrition will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties, except as provided in the Transfer of Control section. To help provide our services, we occasionally provide information to other companies that work on our behalf. We require these companies to keep your information secure and they may not use or disclose this information for any purpose other than providing the services on our behalf.. In addition, as stated in the Transfer of Control section, your personally identifiable information may be shared with actual or potential parties to a contemplated transaction where we decide to reorganize or divest part or all of a business or line of our business, without obtaining your consent or any further notice to you. In such circumstances, we will seek written assurances that personally identifiable information will be protected appropriately. Your personally identifiable information will be maintained by Mead Johnson Nutrition until such time that you ask us to remove it, or until such time as the information is removed as part of our record retention practices.

### **Update and Correction of Personally Identifiable Information**

When we collect personally identifiable information from you, such as your name, postal address, email address, etc., you may tell us that you do not want it used for further marketing contact and we will respect your wishes. You can update your marketing options via opt-out instructions at the bottom of any email from us or, if you have registered for the website, via the Profile Update feature.

Alternatively, except as limited in the Regulatory Requirements section of this Privacy Policy, you may update or correct your personally identifiable information or opt-out from our mailings and other services that you may have previously requested, by contacting us through the email address or phone number listed in the Questions section of this Privacy Policy.

### **Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

Mead Johnson Nutrition will not treat as confidential any information that you provide that is not personally identifiable, such as questions, comments, ideas, or suggestions. You should be aware that Mead Johnson Nutrition will be free to disclose through any reasonable means and use for any internal marketing, internal research, or customer service purposes, such information in its sole discretion. By providing such information to Mead Johnson Nutrition, you understand and agree that no relationship has been created between Mead Johnson Nutrition and you, and Mead Johnson Nutrition has no obligation to you whatsoever regarding that information.

### **Use of Cookies and Web Beacons**

We store some information on your computer using a technique your browser supports called "cookies." The cookies are used for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to: helping you sign in (e.g., remembering your user ID if you enroll or register), remembering some of your customized user preferences (if elected), and helping us better understand how people use our websites. In some cases, this information will help us tailor content to your interests or help us avoid asking for the same information when you revisit our websites. To disable or limit the use of cookies, please refer to the options provided by your Internet browser. If you do so, however, some pages on our websites may not work properly.

We also allow third-party companies, including AddThis, to collect certain anonymous information when you visit our website. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information during your visits to this and other websites to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information. A web beacon is a clear image or pixel tag in Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) that we (as well as other companies) place on pages of our website to allow Internet advertising or audience measurement companies to help us analyze our advertising campaigns and general usage patterns of visitors to our websites.

If you prefer that we do not collect non-personally identifiable information about your website visits for the purpose of delivering targeted advertising, you may opt-out by visiting the [AddThis website and clicking on the "Opt-Out" button.](http://www.addthis.com/privacy/opt-out) You can also learn more about this behavioral advertising practice and opt-out of targeted advertising delivered by multiple ad networks at the [Network Advertising Initiative.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)

With or without cookies, our websites keep track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from (i.e., your IP address, domain name), date and time of the page request, the referring website (if any), and other parameters in the URL (e.g., search criteria). We use this data to better understand website usage on the whole and to determine which areas of our websites users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas). This information is stored in log files and is used by Mead Johnson Nutrition for statistical reporting.

### **Security**

We take reasonable precautions to maintain the protection of personally identifiable information collected through our websites and used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In addition to technical safeguards, we also use physical controls and procedures to safeguard your personally identifiable information. However, we cannot guarantee that it is completely secure from people who might attempt to evade our security measures or intercept transmissions over the Internet. By providing your personally identifiable information, you are agreeing to accept our security measures as described above.

### **Transfer of Control**

Circumstances may arise where we decide to reorganize or divest part or all of our business or a line of our business, including our information databases and websites, through a sale, divestiture, merger, acquisition, or other means of transfer. In any such circumstance, personally identifiable information may be shared with, sold, transferred, rented, licensed or otherwise provided or made available by us or on our behalf to actual or potential parties to, and in connection with, the contemplated transaction (without your consent or any further notice to you). In such circumstances, we will seek written assurances that the personally identifiable information of our customers will be protected appropriately.

### **Regulatory Requirements**

If you contact us regarding your experience with using any of our products, we may use the information you provide in submitting reports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and as otherwise required of us by law or governmental audit. We may also use the information to contact your healthcare professional to follow up regarding an unexpected event involving the use of any one of our products. You understand that to comply with the law, Mead Johnson Nutrition may not be permitted to comply with your request to amend or remove personally identifiable information that was provided to Mead Johnson Nutrition by a healthcare professional or a consumer regarding an adverse event or reaction involving medicine or medical devices.

### **Law Enforcement**

In rare situations, we may be required by court order or other legal or regulatory process, or as otherwise required by law to divulge personally identifiable information to law enforcement authorities, the courts, or regulatory authorities. Mead Johnson Nutrition will cooperate in responding to such requests, in accordance with the regulatory or legal process, and will take appropriate measures to ensure that the requester understands the sensitive nature of any health-related personally identifiable information they receive.
