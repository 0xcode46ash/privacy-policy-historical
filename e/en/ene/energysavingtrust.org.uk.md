  * Send postal mail
  * Carry out credit checks
  * Maintain our IT systems
  * Where we make use of third parties to process personal information, we will ensure that they have adequate security measures in place and that they comply with this privacy policy.



We share information, for analysis purposes, with government departments and bodies (including the devolved nations) that provide funding to the Energy Saving Trust or have an interest in our activities.

We will also share information about you when we are required to so by law or if we have your permission to do so.

### Marketing

The Energy Saving Trust will not contact you for marketing purposes, such as notifying you of new offers and grants relating to sustainable energy use, unless you agree to this when you supply us with your information or if at a later time you sign up to receive marketing information. 

We may occasionally present a promotion that is sponsored by a third-party company or organisation. To qualify for entry, we may ask you to provide personal information – if we intend to share that information with the sponsors, we will make this clear.

You have the right to stop us using information about you for marketing purposes. If we want to use information about you for marketing, we will ask before we collect it. 

If you agree to let us use information about you for marketing you can change your mind at any time.

There will be instructions of how to easily opt-out of marketing within each correspondence or you can contact us with your instructions.
