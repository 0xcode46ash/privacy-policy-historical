At times, we may be working with third party companies to execute a specific promotion or program. If the information is to be shared with any third-party for the purposes of executing a specific promotion or program, the details will be clearly communicated in the program's rules for the specific program or promotion, and the third-party will have no right to use the information for independent purposes. When a user signs up for these services, he or she will have to opt-in to permit Eveready to share names or other contact information necessary for the third-party to provide these services. These third-parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information, except for the purpose of providing these services.
