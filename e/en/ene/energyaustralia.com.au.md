# Privacy policy - EnergyAustralia

## Protection of your privacy

This Policy Statement refers to all of the activities of the TRUenergy group of companies operating in Australia; this includes all EnergyAustralia electricity and gas retail customers.

This Policy Statement summarises how we deal with your personal information. We are committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the National Privacy Principles. "Personal information" is information about individuals, including name, address, telephone number, date of birth, financial circumstances, credit worthiness, credit history and the conduct of your account.

## How do we collect your information?

We collect personal information in a variety of ways, including from you directly (including when you interact with us in writing, electronically or via telephone), when you visit our website (including when you submit a quote or contact form), when you participate in our events or promotions, and from public sources of information. At all times the collection of this information is obtained by lawful means in a manner that respects your privacy and confidentiality.

## How do we use your information?

Your privacy is respected, and we do not sell, rent or trade your personal information. 

We use your personal information for a variety of purposes to effectively conduct our business, including to:

  * supply products and services to you and to administer and manage those products and services (including billing and collecting debts);
  * provide you with information about us and our products and services, including how your use of our products or services can be improved;
  * gain an understanding of your energy needs in order to provide you with better products and services and maintain our high levels of customer service;
  * conduct research and development;
  * conduct appropriate checks for credit-worthiness and for fraud; and
  * comply with our legal obligations.



To help us carry out these activities, from time to time we disclose your personal information to other parties including: 

  * our contractors, suppliers and agents who assist us to provide products and services to you; 
  * companies who manage the distribution of energy; 
  * credit providers and agencies; 
  * government and regulatory authorities (as required or authorised by); 
  * our profession advisors (such as auditors and lawyers); and 
  * organisations that assist us to conduct research or analyse data.



We will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third parties are bound by privacy and confidentiality obligations in relation to your personal information.

We also use your personal information to provide you with information on products, services and offers that we believe may be relevant to you or that you would be interested in, even after you cease acquiring products or services from us. You can tell us if you do not want to receive such information by contacting us on **13 15 35** (electricity and gas customers under the EnergyAustralia brand) or **13 15 02** (customers under the TRUenergy brand).

## How do we make sure the information we hold about you is current?  


We take reasonable steps to hold only accurate, complete and current personal information. 

## Do you hold sensitive information about me?   


We will only collect sensitive information about you with your consent (unless we are otherwise allowed or required by law to collect that information).  Sensitive information includes information about your health, your race or ethnic origin and religious beliefs. You may wish to provide to us with sensitive information about you from time to time, for example where you have particular energy requirements due to special medical needs. This type of information is treated in confidence.

## Do you record my phone calls to you?   


Yes, there are two instances where your phone calls may be monitored. The first is for training, service quality control and compliance purposes, where we may record and monitor telephone calls between you and us. The second concerns calls to traders in our energy trading business. These calls may be recorded and archived. 

## Can I change information about myself?   


Please let us know if the personal information we have about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date and we will take reasonable steps to correct it. 

## How can I get access to my information?  


You may obtain details of the personal information we hold about you on request. If providing this access may disclose information about another party, or if this access may disclose commercially sensitive information, we may reasonably limit your access. 

## How do we manage privacy issues about credit?   


In some circumstances we may obtain credit reports about you from a business that provides commercial credit worthiness information.  
If, after reasonable follow up, monies owed by you to us remain outstanding, we may supply relevant personal information and details of the monies owed to a credit reporting agency. The information we may supply includes (but is not limited to): 

  * Identity details that are sufficient to identify you.
  * The fact that you have applied for credit and that we are a credit provider to you. 
  * Advice about payments more than 60 days overdue which are in collection that we are permitted to report. 
  * That cheques drawn by you, or direct debit requests to your account, have been dishonoured. 
  * That, in our opinion, you have committed a serious credit infringement. 
  * That credit provided to you has been paid or otherwise discharged.   




Notification to a credit reference agency that any of your outstanding payments are no longer overdue will only be made following receipt of monies owed, including any accrued interest.

## What if you disagree with our decision?   


Where we make a decision about you or affecting you, you may ask us to explain the basis on which that decision was made, and you may ask to see the personal information (if any) on which our decision is based.
