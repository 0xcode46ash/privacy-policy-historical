# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: August 21, 2008**

This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy policy applicable to information collected through all sites (" **Site** " or " **Sites** ") of George Weston Bakeries (" **GWB** "). As used herein, " **You** " and " **Your** " refers to any individual, company or legal entity that accesses or otherwise uses the Sites. By using any Site, You are consenting to the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy in effect at the time You use the Site. For other terms and conditions that apply to Your use of the Sites, please review our Terms and Conditions.

In this Privacy Policy, " **Personal Information** " means any information by which You can be personally identified, and includes Your name, Your address, Your telephone number and Your email address. Most Sites do not require that You submit Personal Information to GWB. However, some Sites may request Personal Information in order to help GWB serve You more effectively. GWB collects Personal Information from You only when You voluntarily submit such Personal Information to GWB and only (1) in connection with additional information requests or suggestions submitted by You, (2) during voluntary registration by You, (3) during certain special promotions, contests or survey registrations, (4) in connection with information entered by You as part of a purchase, product inquiry or other input process, and (5) in connection with employment applications.

It is the policy of GWB not to collect or accept Personal Information from children under the age of thirteen (13). For more information on our policy relating to children under the age of thirteen (13), see "Children's Privacy Policy" section below.

You can review and update Your Personal Information by visiting GWB's "Stay In Touch" website and logging into Your account.

For each visitor to a Site, GWB's web servers automatically recognize information regarding the visitor's domain name (or that of the visitor's access provider). GWB's traffic monitoring software tracks the number of times the Site is hit, how many visitors come to the Site, and which parts of the Site they frequent. GWB does not retain the addresses collected by the program, nor does it disclose them to anyone outside of GWB. GWB's web site logs are not personally identifiable, and GWB makes no attempt to link them with individuals who actually browse the Site.

GWB's Site also uses cookies to facilitate Your use of the Site. When You choose to accept a cookie, a small text file will be created on Your computer's hard drive that gives you a unique, random ID. This ID enables the Site to readily recognize You on a subsequent visit to the Site. For example, a cookie may indicate the preferences selected by You on a prior visit and facilitate more efficient browsing on subsequent visits. Site users always have the option of not accepting cookies. GWB's cookies do not contain personally identifiable information. You are free to change Your web browser to prevent the acceptance of cookies. However, such refusal of cookies may limit Your ability to access the full functionality of the Site.

Regardless of the purpose for which Personal Information is submitted, it is GWB's policy to maintain all Personal Information as confidential and to use such Personal Information only for the following purposes:

• | to contact you in response to your inquiries, comments and suggestions;   
---|---  
• | to contact you otherwise when necessary;   
• | for the specific purpose for which it was volunteered (for example, to receive notice from us, etc.);  
• | to track our visitors' use of the Site for internal market research;   
• | to improve the Site and the services GWB promotes or provides through the Site;  
• | to customize the content and/or layout of our Site for each individual visitor;   
• | to ask for Your participation in brief surveys;   
• | to complete any purchases or other transactions you may perform at the Site;   
• | to notify visitors about updates to the Sites or Services;   
• | to notify You about promotions, special offers, etc., regarding products and services provided by GWB or its affiliates or partners;   
• | to be provided to GWB affiliates or third parties in connection with the legitimate business purposes of GWB or the Site;   
• | to be provided to third parties for the legitimate business purposes of those third parties;   
• | to generate aggregate statistical studies;   
• | as required by law or regulation, or as requested by government authorities;  
• | in connection with an acquisition, merger, sale or other transfer of all or substantially all of the business associated with the Site;   
• | to consider your application for employment at a GWB company; and  
• | for other legitimate business purposes of GWB or the Site.  
  
We will not, however, disclose Your Personal Information to any GWB affiliate or third party unless you have specifically agreed to such disclosure at the time Your Personal Information was submitted. Unless You have otherwise expressly consented, any information provided to GWB affiliates or third parties will be in an aggregate, anonymous format.

If the Sites contain links, the linked sites are controlled by and maintained by independent third parties. GWB does not control use of information provided to third parties and all such information will be governed by the third party's privacy policy.

We have reasonable and appropriate security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of all Personal Information under our control. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect Your Personal Information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information You disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction or inadvertent disclosure of your Personal Information.

GWB reserves the right, at its discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Privacy Policy from time to time. The amended Privacy Policy will be effective upon posting on the Site. Your continued use of the Site and/or the services on the Site constitutes Your assent to such amended Privacy Policy and Your agreement to be bound thereby. GWB may, but is under no obligation to, provide You notice of such modifications to this Privacy Policy via email or other communication.

**Children's Privacy Policy**

We have devoted a portion of the Site to provide certain features and information that we think may be fun and useful for children. We do not require any children under the age of 13 to provide any Personal Information to use these features and access such information. For those features of the Site for which we do require Personal Information, we do not knowingly permit children under the age of 13 to submit Personal Information to us, and we do not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from such children. However, if a child under the age of 13 submits a question to us on the Site and identifies his or her age, we may use the child's email address for the sole purpose of responding to the child's question on a one-time-only basis; we will not use the child's email address to contact the child again and we will delete it from our records once we have responded.

Any questions regarding this Privacy Policy should be directed to the GWB Webmaster: [webmaster@gwbakeries.com](mailto:webmaster@gwbakeries.com).
