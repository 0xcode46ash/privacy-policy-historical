We use non-identifying, aggregate information to better design our website and network infrastructure. Cookies may be used to facilitate your navigation of our site.

**Our Commitment To Data Security:**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information:**

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect and maintain online by logging in as Administrator. You can delete all your personally identifiable information that we maintain online by logging in as Administrator, selecting Close Account, and responding affirmatively to the email that will be sent to your Administrator's email address.

**How To Contact Us:**

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please use the [Feedback](https://web.archive.org/qwtnp/data/fdb$start.givefeedback) link provided throughout our site for the quickest response. If your questions or concerns are not urgent, you may send email to [info@EnterTime.Net](mailto:info@EnterTime.Net). You may call us at 972-783-8770 to leave voice mail, but our business model for providing this inexpensive, efficient service precludes relying on such high-cost, inefficient means of communication.
