# The Academy for Optimal Living | en*theos

## Your information is safe with us!

We want you to be able to enjoy all of the goodness that en*theos has to offer with the peace of mind that your information is secure and confidential with us.

## What do we keep?

When you sign up for any en*theos products or Academy courses, we only keep the basics. Your name (Dale Carnegie would be proud), email address, and telephone number (optional and only if provided on sign up).

Any financial information (credit card information, PayPal username) is not stored and not available to us once the transaction is complete, and is only used for billing purposes.

## What do we share?

We love and respect all of our amazing peeps and want to remind you that we do not sell your personal information. We like to keep it just between us. :)

Basic information is shared with the Professors we partner with to teach Academy courses for the purpose of supporting you through the courses and beyond.

When you sign up for one of our Symposiums, your name and email address are shared with the Host-only of that conference, and not the guest experts.

We don’t share your information with any third party outside of our organization, except for the fulfillment of an order (applies to shipping the hardcover of A Philosopher’s Notes through our fulfillment partners at [Bang Printing]()).

While you are on our site we use cookies (the delicious, vegan kind that Alexandra whips up :)) to keep track of what you put in your shopping cart, and how you arrived at our site. If you were referred by one of our amazing affiliates, we keep track of what you purchase so we can give them a virtual hug/high five! No personal information is shared with our affiliates. (Learn more about our affiliate program here!)

**Please note** , your profile and posts on the site may be indexed and findable on Google and other search engines. (We are working on giving you better control over the privacy of content you post on the site and will release it soon!)

## You have total control of what we retain.

If you’d like to know what information we have (hint: it’s your name and email address :)), please don’t hesitate to email us at [support@entheos.com](mailto:support@entheos.com) or call (866) 921-8566 to speak directly to one of our team members, and we’ll be happy to let you know + make any adjustments you feel are necessary for the security of your information.

At your request we will gladly: 

  * Provide what personal info we have
  * Correct any of your personal data
  * Delete any personal data
  * Listen to your feedback about how we can better protect your privacy and security



We always want to share all the cool stuff we think will optimize your life, but if you aren’t diggin’ us, you absolutely can remove yourself by unsubscribing from our mailing list at <http://www.entheos.com/newsletters/unsubscribe>.

## How we keep your information on lock down.

We are very precautious with your personal data and very aware of financial information security in today’s digital marketplace.

Whenever you submit sensitive information, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.

We also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy or have suggestions on how we can improve it, please let us know by calling us at (866) 921-8566 or by emailing us at [support@entheos.com](mailto:support@entheos.com).

Thank You! :)
