## What Information is Collected

### Personal Information

As a general rule, you will not be required to provide personally identifiable information as a condition of browsing our Sites. However, we may collect personal information from you in certain areas of our Sites when you submit it to us in connection with one or more specific purposes, which are described below under “How Collected Information Is Used.” When such information is gathered, we will collect the minimum amount necessary to facilitate transactions with you, to improve our Sites and your customer experience and to make future visits to our Sites easier and more personalized for you. We collect the personal information you may voluntarily provide to us, including:

  * Name
  * Mailing Address
  * Telephone Numbers
  * Email address
  * Date of birth
  * User name & password
  * Mobile carrier



We access location based information from your computer or mobile device while searching for an Enterprise Rental or Car Sales location in the area in which you have expressed interest. We do not use this information to specifically locate you for any reason other than to provide you the service. If you do not wish to allow us to use your location information then please do not use the service. If you have allowed us to utilize your location information in the past and wish to revoke the permissions, please turn off location services at the device level.

Failing to provide requested information will not inhibit your ability to browse the Sites, but it may prevent you from being able to complete certain transactions or receive certain services from us.

We provide you the ability to enter your friend’s name and email address in order for Enterprise to send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Sites. Enterprise stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.

We may combine the information that you submit to us or to third party providers with information related to your transactions with us, such as rental location and vehicle type, car sales location, as well as with information we receive or access about you from credit reporting agencies and other data base providers or service providers who assist us in processing requests and optimizing our services.

### Non-Personal Information

As part of the standard operation of our Sites, certain non-personal, anonymous information may be automatically provided to our Web servers by your computer or mobile device. For each visitor to one of our Sites, our Web server automatically recognizes the visitor’s domain name or IP address (where possible), but not the visitor’s email address. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. As part of the protocol of the Internet, Web servers can identify your computer by its IP address. In addition, we may collect your browser type and operating system. Except as otherwise explained in this policy, we may combine the non-personal information we collect from you (as described above and as described below, under “Cookies & Pixel Tracking”) with your personal information.

We also collect Mobile Device brand and model, mobile operation system and carrier to determine whether users view our .com or mobile version of the Sites.

### Cookies & Pixel Tracking

Cookies are short strings of text sent from a Web server to a Web browser when the browser accesses a Web page. In simplest terms, when the browser requests a page from the Web server that originally sent it the cookie, the browser sends a copy of the cookie back to that Web server. A cookie typically contains, among other things, the name of the cookie, a unique identification number, an expiration date and domain name information. Cookies may be “session-only” or “persistent.” Persistent cookies last for more than one visit and are typically used to allow a visitor to our Sites to personalize their experience.

By adjusting the settings in your browser, you can refuse to accept cookies or give yourself the opportunity to accept or reject cookies, or receive notice of cookies. Software programs are available that block cookies. Blocking certain cookies will also block the use of certain pixel tags. Refusing cookies may impinge or block altogether your user experience by eliminating personalization or other features.

We use cookies to analyze the traffic on our Sites (such as total visitors and pages viewed), to personalize features and content, to save you the trouble of retyping your name or other information when you come back to our Sites, and to make improvements to the Sites based on the data we collect. We do not save passwords or sensitive information in cookies. The use of cookies has become a standard in the Internet industry, especially at Web Sites that provide any kind of personalized service.

We also use pixel tags (also known as “clear gifs,” “Web beacons” or “1-by-1gifs”) on our Sites and in our advertisements. Pixel tags consist of a few lines of computer coding and are not visible to the site user. Pixel tags help us analyze our visitors’ behavior on our Sites and with respect to our advertisements (for example, whether or not you have clicked on one of our ads). We may work with our Affiliates (companies related to us) and our service providers to help us track, collect and analyze this information. Pixel tags may be used to collect a variety of information about your visit to our Sites, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click and other actions you take, all of which may be combined with other information we have collected from you. We use this information to provide personalized and relevant content and advertising to you, to measure the effectiveness of our marketing and advertisements, to enhance the effectiveness of our Sites, to compile aggregate usage statistics, to determine if errors are being encountered on the Sites and for other internal business purposes. To opt-out of tracking for our rental sites please [click here](http://www.coremetrics.com/company/privacy.php#optout). To opt-out of tracking for all of our other business units, please [click here](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). This add-on stops data from being sent from your computer when you visit websites that use Google Analytics Javascript (ga.js) to track usage. The beta version of the opt-out is available for Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome.

We work with a service provider that helps us to optimize our search engine marketing. It does this by associating pixel tags with the terms that you use when searching online for a rental car (for example, SUV or a certain destination). If you select Enterprise from among your search results, our service provider will analyze your search terms to present you with the most appropriate landing page (for example, SUVs available in Florida). Our service provider does not tie the search terms or any other information to your personal information; it may tie search term information to your IP address. Please go to the section below, CHOICES YOU CAN MAKE ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION, for information about how you can block cookies and certain pixel tags.

Cookies may also be placed by third parties during your visit to our Sites. Our Affiliates and business partners (including our advertisers) may use these cookies in connection with their use of pixel tags for online preference marketing purposes (discussed below) or otherwise. We do not control these cookies. The use of cookies by advertisers has become standard practice in the Internet industry.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies employ cookie and pixel tag technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. To do so, these companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our Sites and other Web sites. This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown, your cookie and the first three octets of your IP address. These technologies are not tied to personally identifying information. This anonymous information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes.

These third-party advertising companies may use information about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide ads about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice, and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://preferences.truste.com/preference_enterpriseads.html). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

## How Collected Information is Used

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

  * To assist you with reserving, renting, purchasing and leasing motor vehicles.
  * To provide information concerning car sales, ride-sharing and fleet services.
  * To conduct other transactions that you request.
  * To service your account with us, respond to your questions and contact you when necessary.
  * To provide you with discounts, coupons, offers and other information and opportunities and services that may be of interest to you.
  * To assist us in providing better products and services (for example, we may contact you by telephone, mail, email or invite you to participate in a voluntary survey to assist us in evaluating the performance of our staff, to assess the quality of product and service received and to help us improve our Sites, facilities and services).
  * To compile statistics and analysis about our customers’ use of our Sites, products and services, which statistics are only used internally to enable us to provide better customer service and products to you and other customers in the future.
  * To learn more about the traffic patterns and other uses of our Sites.
  * To improve the functionality and features of our Sites.
  * To help us to operate, maintain and improve our systems and Sites.



Data collected online or via a Mobile Device may also be combined or merged with information you provide to us by means other than through this site as part of the standard business operations of Enterprise and its Affiliates; provided, however, this Privacy Policy applies only to data collected on-line. If the same information about you is gathered from our Sites and also from other sources with different privacy policies, Enterprise may elect, in its sole discretion, to treat such information in accordance with the privacy policy that least restricts our use and disclosure of such information.

We attempt to retain information we collect for commercially reasonable periods of time or in accordance with specific policies or as required by law. Information collected for a specified purpose will only be used for that purpose and, after a reasonable period of time, will no longer be actively stored when that purpose has been fulfilled. Inactive data may, however, continue to be used for statistical, marketing, archiving, and other analytical purposes.

PLEASE BE AWARE THAT, UNLESS PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOUR USE AND/OR CONTINUED USE OF THIS WEB SITE OR MOBILE WEB SITE SIGNIFIES YOUR EXPRESS CONSENT THAT INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO OR STORED ON SERVERS AND PROCESSED OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY OF YOUR RESIDENCE, INCLUDING, THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM, IRELAND, GERMANY, AND CANADA. PLEASE ALSO BE AWARE THAT THE PRIVACY LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE INFORMATION MAY BE STORED MAY NOT BE AS COMPREHENSIVE OR OFFER AS MUCH PROTECTION AS THE LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.

## With Whom The Information May Be Shared

We may disclose the information we collect from and about you: (1) when we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, customers or other users of our Sites, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities; (2) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process; and (3) to our Affiliates, business partners and/or third parties, subject to confidentiality agreements as appropriate, for administrative, technical support or other business purposes as necessary to facilitate our transactions with you, analyze our data, conduct mobile analytics services, or to maintain and improve our services. We may disclose your personal information to third-party service providers located in the United States, such as an email provider to send email communications to you on our behalf and marketing agencies who help maintain our customer database. These service providers are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality and security of your information. However, your information may be accessible to U.S. authorities in accordance with U.S. law.

Enterprise or its Affiliates may sell or buy other businesses or entities. In such transactions, personal information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that Enterprise or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our Sites of any such change in ownership or control with regard to your personal information.

Except as explained above, we will not share any of your personal information with any third party, unless we have received your express permission to do so.

With your prior notice and consent, we may share your name and email address with our co-branded partners and affiliates in order to provide the services you have requested and for marketing purposes. If you wish to stop receiving promotional communications from these third parties, please review the CHOICES YOU CAN MAKE ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION section below.

## Linked Sites

Our Sites may contain links to other Web Sites (such as those of our marketing partners or advertisers), which may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the activities and practices that take place on these Web Sites. Accordingly, we recommend that you review the privacy policy posted on any Web Site that you may access through our Sites.

## Children's Privacy

Enterprise Sites are not directed to, and Enterprise does not knowingly collect personal information from, children under the age of 13. We recommend that parents actively participate in their children’s use of the Internet.

## Choices You Can Make About Your Information

We give you a number of choices about the collection, use and distribution of your information. For example, you must affirmatively request to receive email advertisements from us, our Affiliates and/or business partners concerning information about special offers, promotions and new features, products and services. Every Enterprise email advertisement will provide you with the opportunity to remove yourself from our email list. You may choose to opt back in to our email advertisements at anytime, in which your most recent action will prevail.

To opt out of receiving further promotional communications from our third party co-branded partners and affiliates, please contact them directly.

We will give you an opportunity to opt-out of the gathering of your personally identifiable information, specific uses of your personally identifiable information and any marketing promotions in accordance with the procedures set out in the section below, CORRECTING OR CHANGING YOUR INFORMATION.

## Correcting or Changing Your Information

We are very concerned about the accuracy, currency and completeness of the information we collect and make efforts we deem appropriate to ensure that the information we have is accurate and up-to-date. If you wish to review, amend, correct, update or delete personally identifiable information we have collected about you online, or if you wish to opt out of further receiving marketing or promotional emails, or (if you’ve opted in for us to do so) from sharing of your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes follow the unsubscribe instructions in each promotional email or contact us at the information provided below. Please also contact us if you have any questions about privacy on our Web Site or Mobile Site. You may contact us via email at [customerservice@erac.com](mailto:customerservice@erac.com), and we will attend to your request and make any necessary revisions. If you prefer, residents of the United States of America can call us at (877) 858-3884 or send mail to us at: Enterprise, Internet Privacy Questions, 600 Corporate Park Drive, St. Louis, MO 63105. We will respond to your access request within 30 days.

We reserve the right not to allow access to your information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is prohibited by law or if the rights of another individual might be violated.

## Security Procedures

We are very concerned with the security of your personally identifiable information and try to provide secure transmission of your information from your PC and Mobile Device to our servers. For certain transactions on certain areas of our Sites, we may use Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to secure the transfer of information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted over the Internet. Once we receive your information, we take steps that we believe are reasonably appropriate to protect its security, both internally and from outsiders, from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, and to ensure the integrity of the data we collect. We use a combination of technological, physical, administrative and policy methods as well as organizational controls and non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements as we deem appropriate to protect this data.

If you have a user name and password for any of the features on our Sites, you have the responsibility of keeping your password secret. You should not reveal your password to anyone. We will not ask you in an unsolicited telephone call or email for your password. In addition, you should take reasonable precautions when using a computer that is not your own or in a public setting.

## Changes in Terms

We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by means of a notice on Sites prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
