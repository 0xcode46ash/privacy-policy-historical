The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) take the issue of privacy very seriously.

The AAO-HNS and AAO-HNSF do not sell, distribute, barter, or transfer personally identifiable information obtained from a web visitor user to a third party. Any information collected on any AAO-HNS website will only be used for the purpose stated. Only those who ask for information from us will receive email communications from us.

AAO-HNS members who provide us with an email address may be added to the AAO-HNS email list or certain other private lists. The AAO-HNS email list is only for important Academy communications, such as ENeT News or ENT Mail. You will not receive third-party advertising or promotional material on this list.

The AAO-HNS and AAO-HNSF do not sell or distribute your email address to third parties, such as outside commercial, charitable, or professional organizations, under any circumstances. You can remove your email address from our files at any time. Unless you notify us otherwise, your email address may be available to other members through our print and online members-only directory.

The AAO-HNS may use "cookie" technology to aid in site navigation and registration and to obtain non-personal information from its online visitors. Such data may be collected and used in aggregate by the AAO-HNS/F to shape and direct the creation and maintenance of content and to determine the type of advertisement to be seen by site visitors.

WARNING: This site contains links to other sites. The AAO-HNS/F assumes no responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

Academy Policy Protects Your Identity

It is an unfortunate reality and "sign of the times" that identity theft has become a threat to personal financial security. One form of protection that consumers can take is to minimize public exposure of their Social Security Number (SSN). The AAO-HNS/F is taking all deliberate steps to remove the request for a SSN from all educational materials. Current vendors are being asked to switch to an alternative, unique, numerical identifier for our members immediately. We remind our members to avoid public exposure of their SSN and to add their voices to a call for a change in policy whenever they receive materials that request and/or publish individual's SSN.
