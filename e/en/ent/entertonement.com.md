Privacy Policy

Entertonement understands that privacy is extremely important to you and is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how Entertonement, Inc. ("Entertonement") collects and uses personally identifiable information about visitors to the site and users of the service. By visiting the Entertonement site or using its services, you are accepting the practices outline in this Privacy Policy. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Entertonement does not own or control, or to individuals that Entertonement does not employ or manage.

The information Entertonement collects

Entertonement collects non-personally identifiable information when you visit our website (www.Entertonement.com). This data includes your IP address, the IP address and URL of the Website that sent you to the Entertonement main page, browser cookie and browser type. This data is automatically recorded in our server logs and is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the Entertonement website and services. 

When you use Entertonement services and register for Entertonement, we collect additional information such as your name, mobile phone number, mobile phone device information and network carrier information. We also collect any optional information you choose to enter like email address, location information (such as address, zip code, and country), gender and age.

When you connect to the Entertonement services on your mobile device, if your mobile phone service provider uniquely identifies the device, Entertonement will receive this information. Entertonement may use your unique mobile device identification information to offer you extended services and/or functionality. Some mobile phone service providers are required to operate a system that will record the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the mobile phone service provider, Entertonement may automatically receive this information.

When you visit the Entertonement site, we may send one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Entertonement uses both session cookies - cookies that expire after you close your browser - and persistent cookies - cookies that can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Entertonement's most attractive features.

Entertonement members can invite friends to join the service and preview content by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. Entertonement stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added as Friends of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations. Entertonement does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations, invitation reminders (up to three (3) per email address). 

We will not sell, rent or otherwise distribute personal information to third parties without your consent, except in instances described below.

Additionally, Entertonement will not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or subsequently opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Entertonement service changes or for customer service purposes).

Only Entertonement employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.
