#### Data Protection

Any information you provide us with will only be disclosed in accordance with the Data Protection Act of 1998. 

#### Collection of Personal Information

To open your EntroPay account, we must obtain certain personal information, such as name, address, email or phone number as well as demographic information like age. You should ensure the email address you have registered with us is always correct, so that we can always contact you with important information regarding your account. For certain optional transactions, we also collect selected financial information such as credit card details. For transaction volumes over a certain limit, we are legally required to report some personally identifiable information to the authorities. For verification purposes we reserve the right to request proof of identification in an offline format. Your IP address and access times may be tracked against your user id for the dual purposes of preventing fraud and creating an audit trail when using the EntroPay service.

#### Use of Personal Information

We only use your personal information to service your account and to improve our services to you. However, we do share some financial information as part of normal business operations with banks or credit card processing and verification services. These entities may not use your information for secondary purposes, unless required by law. Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our web site. In the event of a sale of the Company or its assets, your Personal Information may be disclosed to the purchaser of the Company or its assets, solely for the purposes of continuation of the EntroPay service, or similar. Otherwise we will only disclose your information to a third-party with your EXPLICIT permission.

#### Suspicion of Money Laundering, Fraud or Other Illegal Activity

To ensure that EntroPay is not used for Money Laundering, Fraud or Other Illegal Activity, we may monitor user behaviour and transactions. Where we suspect such activity we will not normally tell the user of our suspicions. We will also report to the competent authorities, normally without prior or subsequent notice to the user, any information on the user relating to actual or suspected money laundering, fraud and other illegal activity where we are required by law to do so.

#### Control of Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct and update that user's personally identifiable information, as provided to us. This can be done via our website, or as a last resort by e-mailing us on [support@entropay.com](mailto:support@entropay.com). In order to deactivate your account you will need to contact our support team via the website or via [support@entropay.com](mailto:support@entropay.com). However, please understand we cannot completely delete user information because of legal/regulatory and technical back up requirements.

#### Communication

Upon registration every user will receive an email confirming his successful registration. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services and special deals via newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications and this choice can be made at the time of registration. Should the user wish to change their choice after registration they can e-mail [support@entropay.com](mailto:support@entropay.com).
