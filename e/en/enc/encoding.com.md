**Information We Collect: How We Use Information We Collect**  
Except in the limited circumstances provided below, we do not collect any personally identifiable information while you use the Site. The cases in which we do collect personally identifiable information are as follows:

  * Newsletter



On our Site we make available "fast forward," a newsletter with the intention of providing you with the inside track into the trends and new technologies in the digital music industry. If you elect to receive the newsletter we will ask you to subscribe and provide the following information: your name, company name (if applicable) and email address. This information will only be used to send the newsletter. If, at any time you wish to un-subscribe, you can do so by sending an email to [newsletter@loudeye.com](mailto:newsletter@loudeye.com) with "unsubscribe" in the subject header. 

  * Music Labels



If you represent a music label and are interested in participating in Loudeye services (e.g., services that allow Loudeye customers access to samples of music in your music catalog or that allow us to include your music when we deliver files to licensed users, such as XM Radio), you can request a service agreement on our site. When you request an agreement, we will ask you for the name of your label and any sublabels, as well as an address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address and an individual contact name. This information will only be used to send you the agreement you have requested. 

We also collect and use certain types of non-personally identifiable information.
