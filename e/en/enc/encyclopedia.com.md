Alacritude, LLC respects the privacy of our users. We have created this policy in order to demonstrate our privacy commitment to our users. By coming to a Alacritude site, you are agreeing to and accepting this Privacy Policy as well as the terms and conditions or other end user agreement for that site.

  * We will not distribute information that identifies you individually or reveals your identity ("Identifying Information") unless you give your prior approval in response to a request made by Alacritude or unless distribution of this information is permitted under this Privacy Policy. Your electronic approval will qualify as your consent for this purpose.
  * We will not make Identifying Information available publicly without the prior written or electronic consent of the individual identified unless (a) the information is already publicly available; (b) required by law, court order, or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority; or (c) the information is posted by the user to an on-line bulletin board, chat room, news groups, or other public forum.
  * We may collect and use information about you and your use of the Alacritude sites, including Identifying Information, for our own internal purposes such as, for example, analyzing usage of the Alacritude sites in order to improve them.

If you provide this information, your Identifying Information may be provided (either directly from you or by Alacritude) to the advertiser or web site or company making the offer or providing the gift. You may opt-out regarding how Identifying Information collected from you may be used or distributed when provided to Alacritude at a Alacritude site by either following the applicable instructions and links on the site, in the email or other document, or by sending an email to the Alacritude site Web Master at info@encyclopedia.com or as otherwise posted on the Alacritude sites. To ensure that your opt-out email is effective, you must include the words "opt-out" and "Identifying Information" in the subject field of such email. 
  * Of course, if you make a purchase by credit card or otherwise provide your credit card information, the relevant data will be transmitted to Alacritude's vendor providing such payment processing service. Similarly, if you are using a co-branded site of Alacritude and at least one other third party (indicated by the inclusion of another party's name or product/service name either in the URL or site or by the inclusion of a third party's(ies') logos or trademarks in the site), your Identifying Information may be used and/or distributed by Alacritude pursuant to this Privacy Policy and by the other party(ies) pursuant to this Policy and/or their applicable policy(ies).

The information described in these messages is intended to be of high interest or value to our users. To choose not to receive such messages, a user can simply click or go to a URL link located in every email or other message containing this kind of information, which will remove the user from future mailings. Or, for certain sites a user may edit his/her personal account information, which contains an option on receiving special offers, at any time by clicking the appropriate link on the applicable Alacritude site.

In addition, we may share information with other affiliated companies and joint ventures, for example, but we ask those companies to honor the standards of this Privacy Policy.
