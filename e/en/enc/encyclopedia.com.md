###### Infonautics Privacy Policy

Infonautics Corporation respects the privacy of our users. We have created this policy in order to demonstrate our privacy commitment to our users. By coming to an Infonautics site, you are agreeing to and accepting this Privacy Policy as well as the terms and conditions or other end user agreement for that site. 

·         We will not distribute information that identifies you individually or reveals your identity ("Identifying Information") unless you give your prior approval in response to a request made by Infonautics or unless distribution of this information is permitted under this Privacy Policy. Your electronic approval will qualify as your consent for this purpose. 

·         We will not make Identifying Information available publicly without the prior written or electronic consent of the individual identified unless (a) the information is already publicly available; (b) required by law, court order, or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority; or (c) the information is posted by the user to an on-line bulletin board, chat room, news groups, or other public forum. 

·         We may collect and use information about you and your use of the Infonautics sites, including Identifying Information, for our own internal purposes such as, for example, analyzing usage of the Infonautics sites in order to improve them. 

·         We may use and/or distribute information about you and your use of the Infonautics sites in forms that do not identify you individually or reveal your identity. 

·         Advertisements, promotional offers, promotional e-mails, "free gifts," and links, for example, on the Infonautics sites or sent via e-mail or other means from Infonautics may ask for Identifying Information from you. If you provide this information, your Identifying Information may be provided (either directly from you or by Infonautics) to the advertiser or web site or company making the offer or providing the gift. You may opt-out regarding how Identifying Information collected from you may be used or distributed when provided to Infonautics at an Infonautics site by either following the applicable instructions and links on the site, in the e-mail or other document, or by sending an e-mail to the Infonautics site Web Master at the e-mail address at the end of this policy or otherwise posted on the Infonautics sites. To ensure that your opt-out e-mail is effective, you must include the words "opt-out" and "Identifying Information" in the subject field of such e-mail. 

·         Of course, if you make a purchase by credit card or otherwise provide your credit card information, the relevant data will be transmitted to Infonautics' vendor providing such payment processing service. Similarly, if you are using a co-branded site of Infonautics and at least one other third party (indicated by the inclusion of another party's name or product/service name either in the URL or site or by the inclusion of a third party's(ies') logos or trademarks in the site), your Identifying Information may be used and/or distributed by Infonautics pursuant to this Privacy Policy and by the other party(ies) pursuant to this Policy and/or their applicable policy(ies). 

·         Infonautics may send users, via e-mail or other means, information relating to Infonautics sites and/or information on specials, new products and/or promotions from our marketing partners/colleagues. The information described in these messages is intended to be of high interest or value to our users. To choose not to receive such messages, a user can simply click or go to a URL link located in every e-mail or other message containing this kind of information, which will remove the user from future mailings. Or, for certain sites a user may edit his/her personal account information, which contains an option on receiving special offers, at any time by clicking the appropriate link on the applicable Infonautics site. 

·         In the course of our business, Infonautics might buy or sell sites or assets. In these kinds of transactions, customer information (such as Identifying Information) is usually one of the transferred business assets. In the event that Infonautics, its parent, subsidiaries, or affiliates is acquired, merged, or otherwise combined with another party, customer information (such as Identifying Information) will be one of the transferred assets. 

·         Infonautics may use other companies and persons to perform certain functions for us. These functions might include, for example, processing credit card payments, providing customer service, and sending e-mail. These other companies and persons may have access to customer information (such as Identifying Information) that's needed to perform their functions, but they are not authorized to use it for any other purposes. In addition, we may share information with other affiliated companies and joint ventures, for example, but we ask those companies to honor the standards of this Privacy Policy. 

In order to provide our users with a more complete understanding of how the Infonautics sites collect and use information from our users, we have provided the following information: 

**Internet Protocol (IP) Address**

The Infonautics sites log IP addresses for systems administration, diagnostic, and site tracking purposes, and to report aggregate information to advertisers. The Infonautics sites do not link IP addresses to information identifying users individually. 

**Cookies**

The Infonautics sites use files called "cookies" to store usernames, passwords, and other user preferences so that users don't have to re-enter this information each time they use a particular Infonautics site. Users can remove the Infonautics site cookie information from their cookie files each time they log out of the sites (without removing the cookie information from other web sites that may be stored there) by clicking on the applicable "logout" link on the Infonautics sites screens. In addition, you should be aware that advertisers serving ads on the Infonautics sites may use their own cookies. 

**Information Collection and Opt-Out**

The Infonautics sites' registration forms ask users to enter contact information (like their e-mail address), general information (like their city, state), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). The forms also require unique identifiers (username and password) so that users can be verified when they access the Infonautics sites. The contact information primarily is used to send users daily e-mails and other information they have requested and other information as stated in this Privacy Policy. Users may opt out of receiving future e-mail updates by clicking on or going to the applicable link in any e-mail or other document and following the instructions, or by going to the applicable site's home page and clicking on the applicable "Personalize" link and un-checking the box indicating your wish to receive e-mail updates. The demographic information is used among other things, to tailor users' experiences at the Infonautics sites, distribute and show you content that we think you might be interested in, and display site content according to your preferences. 

In addition, advertisers or web sites that have links on the Infonautics sites may collect personally identifiable information about you. The privacy and information practices of those advertisers or web sites linked to the Infonautics sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy. 

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy is subject to modification from time to time. You may be notified: (1) in an e-mail sent to the e-mail address you have provided to Infonautics through the Infonautics sites, or (2) Infonautics' posting of a notice for at least 30 days on this web site or the applicable Infonautics site that the Infonautics sites Privacy Policy has been changed. Should you wish to opt-out of such modifications to the Privacy Policy, you may do so by either following the applicable instructions and links on the site or e-mail or sending an e-mail to the Infonautics sites Web Master at the e-mail address below, making sure to include the words "opt-out" and "modification" in the subject field.
