Privacy Policy

**Making a purchase at encompassparts.com is 100% safe**  
When we request personal information from you – such as name, address, phone number, credit card number – it is done on our secure servers. We use industry standard technology to protect confidential information – SSL (Secured Socket Layer) – an advanced encryption technology that makes personal information unreadable as it travels over the Internet.

We realize that customers are concerned about how the information they provide online will be used. We are committed to protecting your privacy and will use the information we collect about you to process your order and provide a more personalized shopping experience. 

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**  
When you place an order, we ask you to provide information to complete and fill the order by filling out and submitting an online form. This information includes your name, mailing address, email address and credit card information. All information regarding our online customers is stored on a highly-secured server that is not accessible through the Internet.

Encompass is committed to the protection of the privacy of its customers and website visitors. Currently, our website systems do not automatically capture any personal information identifiable to you, including your email address, unless you specifically give it to us.

We do not sell our customer lists or customer information to third parties.

To continuously assess the value of our online shopping experience, we may track the way customers use our site; however, this information is analyzed only as a whole and not at the individual level

 **Children’s Online Policy**  
Encompass is committed to the preservation of online privacy for all of its website visitors, including children. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Encompass sells products intended for purchase by adults. If you make a purchase on encompassparts.com, you are representing that you are an adult. If you are a child under the age of 13, you must ask your parent or guardian to assist you in using encompassparts.com.

**Phone Numbers  
**To provide you with superior customer service throughout your transaction, we may require your phone number when registering or completing your sale. Having your phone number will allow us to contact you in case we need to speak to you about your order to correct or complete inaccurate information.
