» **Parent's Guide**  
As a parent today, you are constantly faced with decisions regarding your child's development in this age of high technology...

These choices can seem especially daunting when you are buying or renting software for children to use on computers and video game systems. Indeed, you can sometimes feel as if you know less about what's in this software than your own kids do.

This is why the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) has written the [Parent's Guide To Interactive Entertainment](https://web.archive.org/web/20001206195500id_/http%3A//www.ebworld.com/ebx/help/esrb/default.asp).
