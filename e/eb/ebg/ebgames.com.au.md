# Privacy Policy - EB Games Australia

**Electronics Boutique Australia Pty Ltd. ABN 50 077 681 442** is aware of your concerns about use of your personal information. We collect personal information from our customers in the regular course of doing business.  This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting ebgames.com.au or ebgames.co.nz, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy notice.

Our privacy policy applies to personal information we collect from customers online who visit ebgames.com.au or ebgames.co.nz; it also applies to any personal information collected at our retail stores and outlets. 

In this document, the word "computer" means any device used to connect to ebgames.com.au and ebgames.co.nz, including, but not limited to, mobile devices.

**Your Consent to Collection of Your Personal Information**

When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, place a pre-order, or return a purchase, we assume you consent to our collecting your personal information and using it for that specific reason.  Please note that our refund policy is prominently displayed in each store location at the point of sale terminal. 

If we ask you for personal information for a secondary reason, like contests, we will either ask you directly for your consent or provide you with an opportunity to say no. 

We may ask you to give your consent, such as by checking a box to indicate your consent to receive marketing communications, or by providing your signature to indicate your acceptance of the use and disclosure terms presented on an application form.  Other times, we may obtain your consent implicitly when we can reasonably conclude that you’ve given consent by some action you have taken or an action you have decided not to take. Generally, this occurs where the purpose for use of your personal information would be reasonably apparent to you.

**How to Change or Withdraw Your Consent**

You may notify us at any time that you wish to withdraw or change your consent to our use and disclosure of your information. We will accommodate your request following receipt of such notice, subject to legal and contractual restrictions related to your transactions. 

If you have "opted in" or subscribed to one of our newsletters or mailing lists, you may "opt out" or unsubscribe at any time.  

When you choose to provide us with your personal information, you consent to the use and disclosure of your personal information as stated in this Privacy Policy and as may be further stated at the time of collection.

**Information That We Collect About Customers**

Information That You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our website or that you give us in any other way. You may need to provide us with personal information to take advantage of some of our features for website customers. You can choose not to provide certain information, but this may limit or prevent us from providing you with the product, service or information that you requested. 

Personal information is information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can be reasonably ascertained, from the information or opinion.  We may collect personal information including the following: 

Contact information – your name, postal address, telephone number, and email address; and your Driver’s License or any other applicable piece of identification in accordance with the federal and state statutes

Personal preferences – opinions, interests, hobbies, product wish lists, language preferences, and marketing consent; and 

Financial information and transaction information – products purchased, method of payment, amount paid, and credit or debit card number. 

We also collect non-personal information.  Non-personal information does not identify you as an individual. For example, when you visit our websites we may collect your Internet Protocol address, the type and version of browser you are using or the referring URL; or we may collect and summarize customer information in a non-personal, aggregate format for statistical and research purposes. 

We obtain information about you when you search, participate in a contest or questionnaire, communicate with customer service, or otherwise contact us or post information on the website. For example, you provide information when you search for a product or provide information to update or create your account with us, communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form; or create any alerts or other email notification services we may offer now or in the future. The information collected includes any personal information that you provide to us, as described above, or that you post on the website.

We ask for your age to determine what promotions we send. We limit some promotional offers to customers of a certain age or older.

We occasionally run our own email surveys and we ask visitors for contact, demographic and technical information. 

Automatic Collection of Information: Through interaction with our website, we will receive and store information that you provide or that is generated by your actions. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies," which are placed on your computer (explained in more detail below). It lets us personalize your experience at ebgames.com.au and ebgames.co.nz, tailoring the content to your interests. A number of companies offer browsers or utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously, but if you use these browsers or utilities, it may limit your ability to use personalized features that we offer.

The information we receive or can determine from your interaction with our website includes your Internet (IP) address; login and password information; e-mail address; web browser type and version; operating system and computer platform; purchase history, which we may aggregate with similar information from other customers; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) click stream to, through, and from our website, including date and time; cookie number; products you viewed or searched for; areas of our website you visited. We also may log the length of time of your visit and the number of times you visit and purchase from us. We assign you a unique internal identifier to help keep track of your future visits.

**Information EB Games Collects Directly from You**

In-Store Purchases - When you purchase a product or service from EB Games, you may need to provide us with contact and payment information (such as credit or debit card information) so that we can process your request or complete your transaction. We also may need contact information to provide delivery services, product service, and extended warranty coverage.  If we want to use your information to send you promotional information, we will ask for your express consent. 

Returns and Exchanges – In connection with any returns, refunds or exchanges, we ask for personal information such as your name, address, and telephone number for the purposes of detecting and preventing fraud.  You also may be asked to produce photo identification for verification purposes.

Purchase Follow-Up and Surveys - Following a purchase, we may send you a follow-up letter either thanking you for your business or inquiring as to whether you are satisfied with your new product.  We may use contact information collected in-store, online, or via our call centres to conduct occasional surveys and other customer research. These surveys are entirely voluntary.

Our Websites – You can browse our websites anonymously.  However, to order products and services from our websites, or to use special features or functions of our websites, you may be asked to provide personal information, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, or credit or debit card information. We use this information to create your account, contact and correspond with you about your order, respond to your inquiries, and monitor functions or features of our websites that you may use.

Customer Reviews and Posted Content – We may provide you with the ability to rate or review products or services we sell, or otherwise post content on our websites.  Any comments or reviews that you provide are accessible to all visitors to our website, so you should use discretion when posting information, and you should not post personal information.  EB Games has no responsibility if you do post personal information.  Subject to the other provisions of this privacy policy relating to your personal information, you grant a perpetual worldwide non-exclusive license to EB Games to copy, use and/or display any content that you post on any of our websites.

Newsletters or Updates - EB Games also may offer you the opportunity to sign up for newsletters or other promotional communications.  If you decide to do so, we will collect your contact information, such as name and email address. This information will only be used to send you the newsletter and promotional announcements that you have requested. You may “unsubscribe” at any time by using the unsubscribe link included in the footer of the newsletter or by using the unsubscribe link included below under the heading “Unsubscribe”.  We do not rent our subscriber list or offer to sell it to other parties.

Contest and Other Promotions - From time to time, we may run contests or promotions. If you participate, you may be asked for contact information as well as additional optional survey information (for example, product preferences).  Personal information from contest entries will be used only to administer the contest and contact you if you win. For research and analysis purposes, we may also aggregate contest survey information in a manner that no longer identifies individual participants. All contests and promotions are subject to this Privacy Policy, applicable legal requirements, and the rules provided for each particular contest or promotion.  If a contest is by a third party, it will be subject to the third party’s contest rules and policies. 

Subscription Services and Activations - EB Games may offer activation of certain products and services like online games, downloadable games or game components, or Internet services. These activations may require that certain contact and financial information be collected and provided to EB Games or to the respective service providers as part of the activation process.  Downloadable games available through our website are offered by Real Networks in the United States, and our website page for downloadable games is hosted by Real Networks.  All order and payment processing, delivery of downloadable games, and customer service for these downloadable games is provided by Real Networks.  Any information collected from you in connection with purchase of downloadable games is subject to the Real Networks privacy policy, and all purchases will be subject to the Real Networks terms of use, which are stated on the Real Networks hosted website. 

Call Centres - EB Games operates customer support call centres to respond to your questions, concerns, or complaints regarding our products or services. When you contact our call centres, we may ask for personal information to help us respond to your inquiry or to verify your identity.  For example if you have a question about the status of a recent online order, we will ask for personal information to verify that you are the account holder. We may also monitor or record your telephone discussions with our customer support representatives for training purposes and to ensure service quality. 

E-mail Communications: We provide email links on our "Contact Us" page that allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have. We may receive a confirmation when you open any e-mail that we send to you, if your computer supports such capabilities. If you send us any email, we will retain such email and your email address for response. We also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary or duplicate messages to you.

Information from Other Sources: If we receive any information about you from other sources, we may add it to our account information. For example, if we receive a list of subscribers to a gaming publication, and we note that you are a subscriber, we may include that information in the account information that we store about you.   We also may receive page-view information from business partners who operate their own websites or for which we provide any services, or search term and search result information from searches conducted through the website.

**An Explanation of "Cookies"**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are placed by us on your computer's storage system through your web browser to enable our systems to recognise your browser when you make future visits to our website, and to store certain information between visits.

You can stop your computer from storing cookies if you want to. Most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. You should look in the "help" area shown on your browser's toolbar. Because cookies allow you to have the benefit of our personalized features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

Website Tracking Information – Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. We may use web beacons (sometimes called “clear gifs”, “web bugs” or “pixel tags”) to compile tracking information reports regarding website user demographics, website traffic patterns, and website purchases. We may then provide these reports to advertisers and others. None of the tracking information in these reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information of individual users. In addition, we may use web beacons in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you do not want to receive these emails, please see the “unsubscribe” section below.  For EB Games’ own research purposes we may link tracking information with personal information voluntarily provided by website users. Once such a link is made, all of the linked information is treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Links to Other Websites - Our website may contain links that permit you to link to other websites or Internet resources. When you click on one of those links you are connecting to another website or Internet resource. EB Games has no responsibility or liability for, or control over, those other websites or Internet resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other websites before you submit any personal information to them.

In-Store Video Surveillance - EB Games retail stores may use video surveillance for safety and loss prevention purposes. The recorded images of our customers, and audio recording of our store premises, may be accessed as part of our security procedures in the store. There also may be occasions where video recording of store activity is used for general demographic or traffic flow analysis.

Data on Returned Product – if you return products that may contain stored or recorded personal information, like computers, game consoles, etc., you are responsible for deleting or removing all personal information and media from your product before you return it. EB Games is not responsible for any personal data or media that you do not delete or remove from such product.

We May Supplement Information - From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information you have provided to us. This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide better service.

**Sharing of Information**  

EB Games does not sell or rent our customers’ personal information to any other party. EB Games may share personal information gathered on our websites with EB Games retail stores (and vice versa) and amongst our corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or divisions for internal business purposes in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  If EB Games shares your information within its corporate family, we will ensure that your information continues to be used only in accordance with this Privacy Policy and your expressed choices. Also, in the normal course of business, we may share some of your personal information with third parties acting on our behalf or as permitted or required by law.  If a third party acting on our behalf has different policies than EB Games relating to privacy, then the website pages through which such information is collected from you will state or provide a link to such policies.

Some of these operations may result in personal information collected by EB Games being stored or processed outside of Australia or New Zealand and, as a result, your personal information may be accessible to law enforcement and regulatory authorities in accordance with the law of these foreign jurisdictions. 

Service Providers - EB Games may use third parties to manage one of more aspects of our business operations, including the processing or handling of personal information.  We may share personal information with such third parties to perform services on our behalf such as e-mail communications, customer lists management, data analysis, fulfilling online orders, processing non-cash payments, sending marketing communications, servicing products, conducting research surveys, verifying and validating information that you have provided to us, delivering products, information systems maintenance, and providing customer support services.  When we do use an outside company, these companies are provided with access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but we use contractual and other appropriate means to ensure that your personal information is used in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Promotional Offers May be Sent to You: We may send you offers on behalf of our company or other businesses, or permit other businesses that we are working with to send you offers, if we believe that you may be interested in receiving these offers. If you do not want to receive such emails in the future, you can notify us, by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link attached to each email.

Product Safety Recalls - In the event we receive notice from a manufacturer or supplier of a product safety recall, we may provide your contact information, limited to name, address, telephone number, and/or email address to the manufacturer so that they may notify you of the recall and supply details of any replacement or repair programs. This transfer of your contact information will occur only for recalls that may impact your personal safety or impair the functionality of the product you purchased from us. 

Sale or Transfer of Business or Assets of EB Games - Any information we have about you may be transferred or disclosed to a purchaser or prospective purchaser in the event of a sale, assignment, or other transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the transferee uses your information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Legal Disclosure - EB Games may disclose your information as permitted or required by law. For example, we may be compelled to release information by a court of law or other person or entity with jurisdiction to compel production of such information. If we have reasonable grounds to believe information could be useful in the investigation of improper or unlawful activity, we may disclose information to law enforcement agencies or other appropriate investigative bodies.

**How does EB Games Protect Your Information?**

EB Games takes appropriate steps to protect your personal information.  We maintain appropriate safeguards and current security standards to protect your personal information, whether recorded on paper or captured electronically, against unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. For example, electronic records are stored in secure, limited-access servers; electronic data is stored behind secured encryption access;   
we use technological tools like firewalls and passwords; and we ensure our employees are trained on the importance of maintaining the security and confidentiality of personal information. 

Although we cannot take responsibility for any theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction of data by a third party, we take reasonable security measures to safeguard against the loss, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of, or unauthorised access to, any personal information you have given us.  EB Games also has taken precautions to prevent the fraudulent use of your information on our websites. EB Games has adopted industry standard authentication procedures, as discussed below, to increase your protection while shopping with us online. This includes, but is not limited to, contacting credit reporting agencies to ensure the authenticity of your credit card and to validate your credit card billing information. Our third party credit card processor also may take actions to determine the validity of your credit card.

SSL Technology - Our websites use encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL encrypts ordering information such as your name, address, and credit card number. 

Choosing a Password - When you create an online account on our websites, you will be prompted to select a personal password. To maximize your level of protection, you should choose a strong personal password, which means that you should use at least 6 characters including a combination of both letters and numbers. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and any account information. EB Games will never send an unsolicited communication asking you for your password or requesting that you update your account credentials.
