Our Privacy Pledge

Dear Valued Customer, 

We understand and share your concern about privacy. We want to assure you that eBags respects your privacy. eBags does not sell, rent, or loan any personally identifiable information regarding its customers to any third party. When an order is placed, we collect basic information including your name, home address, phone, and email address. We use this information to confirm your order and to respond to any questions you may have. Where required, we also share this information with certain intermediaries (UPS, Cybercash, Product Manufacturers) strictly to process and ship your order. Additionally, we may provide this basic information to Netcentives in order to credit you if you are eligible for any incentive programs we offer. In such cases, you will be sent an email from Netcentives confirming the number of ClickMiles you have earned, and how you are able to redeem those ClickMiles. Within that email, you may unsubscribe and will not be contacted by Netcentives again. eBags maintains this partnership with Netcentives because the benefits of this program are highly valued by our customers, however we respect and protect your right to accept this opportunity. 

In return for registering as a member at our site, we offer to keep you informed of new and ongoing benefits, exclusive sales and promotions and other members-only benefits. Our registration form requires you to provide contact information such as your name, home address, phone number, and email address. We appreciate any additional, optional information you are willing to share with us, such as when, where and how often you travel. This optional information helps us tailor your experience at our site, showing you content that we think might be interesting to you. Depending on the information you give us, we will also provide you with birthday reminders, gift ideas, and other special offers. You may make changes to your information profile at any time by logging into "your account" and going to the "Edit My eBags Membership information" section.

When you purchase products from eBags or register as a My eBags Member, we include you in our list to receive email updates about special offers, new products and services, and travel news. We will only send you email communications that you expect as a result of your selections within this membership program, and ad hoc promotions in which you actively choose to participate. If for any reason you do not wish to receive this information, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/my_ebags/index.cfm?fuseaction=unsubscribe), or reply to any of our emails and type "unsubscribe" in the subject line. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time. 

eBags has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information that we collect. We utilize a Cisco firewall and use SSL encryption to keep this information secure. We use your Internet protocol address to help identify you and your shopping cart, and to gather broad demographic information. Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit.

We value your opinion, and we provide an opportunity on the site for you to submit your product commentaries and testimonials. Upon submission, these will be reviewed by our staff and posted on the eBags site for the benefit of other customers. This provides a value to all of our customers who are interested in the travel and product experiences of others. 

If requested, we will provide information where required by law.

If you have further questions about eBags' privacy policy or have other comments on how we can improve the eBags shopping experience, please do not hesitate to email us at info@ebags.com. We always enjoy hearing from you! 

We appreciate your business and wish you the best in your travels.
