Dear Valued Customer, 

We understand and share your concern about privacy. We want to assure you that eBags respects your privacy. eBags does not sell, rent, or loan any personally identifiable information regarding its customers to any third party. We do collect passive information on products browsed via log files and we analyze this informtaion in aggregate to ensure our site is merchandised in a manner that adds the most convenience and value to our customers. When an order is placed, we collect basic information including your name, home address, phone, and email address. We use this information to confirm your order and to respond to any questions you may have. Where required, we also share this information with certain intermediaries (UPS, Cybercash, Product Manufacturers) strictly to process and ship your order. Additionally, we may provide this basic information to Netcentives in order to credit you if you are eligible for any incentive programs we offer. In such cases, you will be sent an email from Netcentives confirming the number of ClickMiles you have earned, and how you are able to redeem those ClickMiles. Within that email, you may unsubscribe and will not be contacted by Netcentives again. eBags maintains this partnership with Netcentives because the benefits of this program are highly valued by our customers, however we respect and protect your right to accept this opportunity. 

In return for registering as a member at our site, we offer to keep you informed of new and ongoing benefits, exclusive sales and promotions and other members-only benefits. We appreciate any additional, optional information you are willing to share with us, such as when, where and how often you travel.
