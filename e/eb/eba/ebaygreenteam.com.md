  * Personal information that you provide when you register, such as your eBay user ID, name, physical address and email address.
  * Information you provide when you participate on the site, such as the comments you post or content you send when you contact us.

### Disclosure

We don’t sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a posting or other content violates other’s rights, or protect anyone’s rights, property, or safety. We may also share personal information with service providers who help with our business operations, and with members of our corporate family, who may provide joint content and services and help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts.

We delete personal information when we no longer need it for the purposes we described earlier.

### Security

We use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure—but as you probably know, nothing’s perfect, so we make no guarantees.

### General

We may update this policy at any time, with updates taking effect when you next post or after 30 days, whichever is sooner. If we or our corporate affiliates are involved in a merger or acquisition, we may share personal information with another company, but this policy will continue to apply.
