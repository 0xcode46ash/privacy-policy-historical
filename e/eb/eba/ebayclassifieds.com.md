  * third parties to comply with our legal requirements, enforce our Terms of Use, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or if we otherwise believe in good faith that the disclosure is needed to prevent imminent physical harm, harm to property, financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity;
  * other third parties to whom you have given consent to share your information via [same as above], e.g. in the framework of a cooperation;
  * we may also disclose your personal information to any other third party with your prior consent.

## Security

We protect your information by using technical and administrative security measures (such as firewalls, data encryption, and physical and administrative access controls to the data and servers) that limit the risk of loss, abuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. If you believe your account has been abused, please contact [Customer Service](mailto:support@close5.com).

## Other Important Information

 **Abuse and Unsolicited Commercial Communications ("spam"):** We do not tolerate abuse of our Services. You do not have permission to add other users to your mailing list (e-mail or postal) for commercial purposes, even if a user has purchased something from you, unless the user has given his or her explicit consent. If you notice that someone is abusing our website (spam or spoof emails), please notify [Customer Service](mailto:support@close5.com).

You may not use our member-to-member communication resources to send spam or content that violates our Terms of Use in any other way. For your security, we may scan messages automatically and check for spam, viruses, phishing and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content.

 **Third Party Privacy Practices:** This Privacy Notice addresses only the use and disclosure of personal information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, or if you are directed to a third party website or application, their privacy policies and practices will apply. We can’t guarantee the privacy or security of your information once you provide it to a third party. You should check the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information, even when dealing with buyers or sellers on our site.

You may use social login (logging in from a social networking service) or regular sign-in each time you log into your account with us. If you use regular sign-in but a password has not been issued to you (because you registered through social login) you need to obtain a password through the password reset flow. When you use social login, the “keep me signed in” policies of the social network provider apply. We do not control those policies. For your safety we recommend that you:

  1. Don’t use social login if you are accessing our Services using a public or shared device; and
  2. Visit your social networking service provider site to learn about their sign in policies and your options.



 **Children’s Privacy:** Our websites are general audience websites, and our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users in this age group.
