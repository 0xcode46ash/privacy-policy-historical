# ebates.com, online shopping rebates, free membership

  
ebates.com does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to any third party. 

ebates.com was founded by two former Deputy District Attorneys who take privacy and security very seriously.  We at ebates.com know that these issues are essential to making this site a success for us and our members.  Rest assured that privacy, security and integrity are first and foremost at ebates.com.

**1) What data we collect and why**

Our vision at ebates.com is to maximize the rewards for all of our members and to provide them with as many benefits as possible.  The first key way in which we provide value is to rebate the commissions we receive from our merchants to you.  Instead of keeping these funds for ourselves, we make our money primarily from marketing partnerships with our merchants, and advertising. 

When first registering with ebates.com, you will be asked only for your email address and a password.  After you have become a member you will be asked to provide some additional demographic information.  Your name, address, hobbies, income, age, marital status and occupation will be asked.  This information helps us understand our your interests and develop an understanding of what might appeal to you.  Based on these demographics, we are able to determine what types of merchants and specials would benefit our members most.  Any information that we collect for demographic purposes will not be used outside ebates.com in any way that could identify you. 

When a member shops or visits one of our merchants, ebates.com may track this information to have a summary of our member's buying interests.  This information will be used by ebates.com to make relevant and personalized offers to our members.  As with any other information that you supply to ebates.com, none of the information that we collect will be released in any personally identifiable way, only in aggregate or anonymous form. 

**2) How your information is used**

We collect information to provide better, more relevant offers to you, whether it is targeted advertising, new merchants that we think our members may like, or choosing new partnerships. In no instance will your personal data be shared with any outside agencies. 

We may provide aggregate statistics about our members, site traffic, sales or other related information; however, none of these statistics will ever be able to be identified as having come from you.   
 

**3) Who sees your personal information**

Only a very limited number of ebates.com employees ever have access to your personal information.  Primarily this information is accessed to provide customer service or to send you your rebate checks. 

We may use contractors or vendors to help us provide some of the services at our site.  If we need to disclose personal information for them to provide the services, it is with the requirement that the information is kept confidential and is used only for those services.   
 

**4) How we keep your information secure**

ebates.com uses a secure, encrypted connection (called an SSL connection) on all pages where you transmit personal data to us.  Whenever you access any of your account pages or change any of your user information, it is done over an SSL connection to ebates.com. In spite of the fact that all important data is sent over an SSL connection, you may notice that on merchant pages, the "padlock" icon in the corner of your browser sometimes does not appear. This is a display issue only, and is caused by the fact that the merchant session is running inside a frame. Rest assured that any time you enter your credit card information at a merchant site, it IS an SSL connection secure connection. 

ebates.com fully GUARANTEES the use of your credit cards when shopping through ebates.com at any of our affiliated merchants.  If, as a direct result of your shopping through ebates.com, someone uses your credit card information to make fraudulent purchases, ebates.com will reimburse you for any costs the credit card company charges you.  Please refer to the [user agreement ](https://web.archive.org/terms_conditions.jsp)for complete information.   
Additionally, all of our database servers that contain customer information reside only on ebates.com's physically secured premises or in our equally secured locations at our service provider.   
 

**5) Your privacy with ebates.com**

ebates.com will never ask for your username, password or any other personal information in an unsolicited phone call, email or letter. 

Further, any contact with ebates.com customer service in which personal information is exchanged with a customer service representative will be used only for the purpose of satisfying that request.  Any personal information you provide will not be recorded or used for any reason beyond that of the stated request without your consent. 

**6) Your privacy with our merchants and advertisers**

ebates.com contains links to various other sites.   Each of these sites has a privacy policy that may differ from that of ebates.com. The privacy practices of other websites linked to ebates.com are not covered by this privacy policy. 

ebates.com will not disclose any of the personal information supplied upon registration to our merchants.  The only information that may be shared between ebates.com and one of our listed merchants is information that pertains to orders.  Order information, including order numbers and amounts, may be available to either ebates.com, the merchant, or third party affiliate program management companies for accurate rebate tracking purposes.  This information will not be released by ebates.com to other parties unless required by law or to protect ebates.com and its members from losses. 

ebates.com does not record any personal information passed from our members to our merchants, including credit card information or merchant passwords. 

**7) Our policies on email**

ebates.com does not support spamming by our members and we explicitly prohibit it in our [member agreement ](https://web.archive.org/terms_conditions.jsp).  If you would like to report an incident of spamming, please contact [abuse@ebates.com](mailto:abuse@ebates.com).   We will investigate and take suitable action at our discretion. 

We ourselves send out three kinds of emails.  Our members may receive:   
1) email essential to the maintenance of your account (most commonly when we need your address to mail you a check);   
2) email notifying you about credits and debits to your account (most commonly when we credit you with a rebate); and   
3) email newsletters and special offers from ebates.com and our merchants and other partners.  You always have the option of opting out of types 2 and/or 3 here. 

Please understand that, though we may have some small influence over our members, we fundamentally cannot control the online or offline actions of our members or other parties, especially when it comes to their use of email or participation in moderated or unmoderated newsgroups.  While we will investigate complaints sent to [abuse@ebates.com](mailto:abuse@ebates.com) and take appropriate action with our members, we will typically not provide any information to third parties about our conversations with our members.  We encourage people to resolve disputes directly with each other and discourage people from attempting to use ebates.com to police their mailbox or newsgroup. 

**8) Cookies and how are they used**

Cookies are small text files that a web site can write to your computer. We may use cookies to identify you and allow you to log in once to ebates.com and shop without having to log in again.  Cookies are also used by many of our merchants to identify you as an ebates.com member. 

ebates.com requires its members to have cookies enabled in order to accumulate rebates.

**9) Your choices and responsibilities**

Periodically we may send you emails on new ebates.com features or special offers.  On every one of these emails you will be given the choice to unsubscribe from ebates.com mailings.  Choice of membership is yours at all times, and you are free to remove yourself as a member of ebates.com at any time.  Simply follow the directions in any of our emails. 

You may also choose to what degree you would like us to contact you.  When we ask for your account info, you may choose that we contact you with special offers, contact you about your orders, or not contact you for either. 

It is the member's responsibility to update and maintain accurate contact information in their account.  You can make changes by visiting your [account page](https://web.archive.org/account_info.jsp) and entering corrections.  Email and street addresses that are entered into a member's personal profile page are the addresses that will be used for all contact including the mailing of rebate checks.  ebates.com is not responsible for checks that are sent to incorrect addresses, if the address in question was the address listed in that member's account at the time of issuance. 

We will post all changes to this Privacy Agreement here at our site.  Please check for revisions when you visit our site again so that you will always be aware of our policies and any changes that might occur. 

**10) Integrity**

Having represented the People of the State of California collectively for ten years in a never ending fight for justice, the founders of ebates.com know that your word is who you are and integrity is the cornerstone of any enterprise whether public, private or personal.  As such, you have our word that we will protect your privacy and safeguard your shopping at all times.
