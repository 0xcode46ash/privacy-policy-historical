USE OF COOKIES

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive by our servers to identify your computer. Cookies are only read by the server that placed them there and are unable to execute any code or virus. We may use cookies to recognize you when you visit our sites, to personalize your experience and generally to serve you better.

## IP Addresses

An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer whenever you’re using the Internet. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 

Ebby Halliday® and its affiliates collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated information to our sponsors, and to audit the use of our site. When visitors request pages from Ebby.com, our servers log the visitor’s IP address. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a visitor’s session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us.

##   
OUR COMMITTMENT TO SECURITY

We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect via the Internet. We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information without your prior knowledge and permission.
