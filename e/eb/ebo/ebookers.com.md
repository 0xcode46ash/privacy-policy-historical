To process your order we will share some of your personally identifiable information with the airline, car rental agency, hotel, or other involved third party. We will provide only the personally identifiable information necessary to ensure the successful fulfilment of your travel arrangements. Also, as an example, the airlines will need name, age, and phone number in case of a cancelled flight, but they may use this information only for contract fulfillment.
