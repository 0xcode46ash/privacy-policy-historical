If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Customer Service by email at privacy@ebooks.com. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe (<http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php>). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.

The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.

eBooks.com respects your privacy. As we develop our online presence, we will revise our Privacy Policy to reflect our practices and to meet any legislative or other requirements.

From time to time, we may also request and you may choose to provide us with personal information through the use of the Website or through email addresses available from our Website. 

If you do not provide us with the personal information that we request, we may not be able to properly assess your request for service and the level of service we can provide you may be reduced to the extent that you do not provide us with relevant information.
