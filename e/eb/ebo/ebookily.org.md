# Privacy Policy

Ebookily.org (“Ebookily.org”) operates the Ebookily.org. It is Ebookily.org’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Ebookily.org collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Ebookily.org’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Ebookily.org’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Ebookily.org may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Ebookily.org also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Ebookily.org does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Ebookily.org’s websites choose to interact with Ebookily.org in ways that require Ebookily.org to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Ebookily.org gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we may in the future require users who wish to sign up for an Account with Ebookily.org to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Ebookily.org are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Ebookily.org collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Ebookily.org. Ebookily.org does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Ebookily.org discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Ebookily.org’s behalf or to provide services available at Ebookily.org’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Ebookily.org’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Ebookily.org will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Ebookily.org discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Ebookily.org believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Ebookily.org, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Ebookily.org website and have supplied your email address, Ebookily.org may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Ebookily.org and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Ebookily.org takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
