Cookies set by third parties

We work with third parties who set cookies and pixel tags to provide their services, including to serve advertising on our Website, to track clicks from our partners’ Websites in order to optimize marketing spend, to provide social networking services, and to serve advertising on websites owned or operated by other companies.

Our advertising partners, some of which include Trade Doubler, Affiliate Future, Responsys, Google Ad Services and Double Click, use cookies and pixel tags in order to identify from which partner’s Website you came so we can optimize marketing spend. Social networking web sites, including Facebook, use cookies to allow you to share content with others. One of our advertising partners, AppNexus, uses cookies to anonymously identify your browser while you are on another website so that we can advertise our Website or third parties to you.  For example, we may serve an airline’s advertising to you while you are on another website, on behalf of that airline. If you wish to opt-out of this kind of advertising, you can either delete cookies on your browser from adnx.com or you can click on the following link <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>. By opting out of AppNexus, you may still receive advertising from ebookers or advertising from third parties that are broadly targeted (not on the basis of your Session Data).

Some of these third parties may combine anonymous information obtained in connection with your interaction with our Website with information obtained from other sources and/or your behaviour on other websites.  We do not share your Personal Information. We do not control the information collected through cookies and pixel tags set by third parties.
