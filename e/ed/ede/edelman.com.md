# Privacy Policy - Edelman

**_Privacy Policy for the Daniel J. Edelman Holdings, Inc. Family of Companies_**

At Edelman, we are strongly committed to protecting privacy. Edelman has adopted global privacy principles which guide how we manage and protect personal data and demonstrate how fair information practices are embedded in our culture. Read more on our [Global Privacy Principles](http://www.edelman.com/privacy-policy/global-privacy-principles/).

As part of our commitment, we strive to protect the privacy of visitors to the sites that we operate (collectively, the “Site”). You can navigate the majority of the Site without giving us any personal information which identifies you.  However, sometimes we need additional information about you in order to provide you with information or services you want to receive from us.   Also, this Site provides a variety of interactive features which provides you with a public forum through which you have the ability to provide information about yourself to Edelman and others.

In this digital world, privacy is important to Edelman and should be important to you. Edelman believes in transparency and we provide this notice so that you can understand our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

**_The Information We Collect_**

Edelman collects two basic types of information:

  * **Personally identifiable information:** This is information that personally identifies one individual from another or enables you to be individually contacted (for example, names, e-mail addresses and other contact information). This information is voluntarily provided to us by Site visitors and is used by us for the purpose of responding to user submissions and fulfilling requests for further information about our services.
  * **Aggregate user and tracking information:** This information gives us insights on how Site visitors use our site. This data is anonymous and does not contain any personally identifiable information. We use this information to ensure that our website, e-mails and marketing efforts continue to appeal to Site visitors and clients.



**_Information you voluntarily provide to Edelman_**

Edelman only collects personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide, for example, when you use our “contact us” feature, sign up for a newsletter, set up a voluntary user profile to post content within our forums or interactive features. Examples of such personally identifiable information that you provide to us may include, among other information, your name, physical address and email address.

The information is stored for the lifetime of the database unless you request that it be removed. The information you provide us will be shared with Edelman employees and service providers to the extent necessary administrate our systems and accommodate your request.
