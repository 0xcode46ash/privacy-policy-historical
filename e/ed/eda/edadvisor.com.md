# ADVISOR MEDIA Privacy Statement

Your privacy is important to Advisor. This statement describes how information about users of Advisor.com and related Web sites is gathered and used.

Most of your use of Advisor Web sites can be done anonymously. To use most of the Advisor features, you don't need to tell us who you are or provide any information about yourself. There are places where we need information from you to so we can give you what you are requesting. You can easily identify these places, because you are asked for information, or you are required to log in, which means we use information you previously provided. 

Customers submit information to Advisor to conduct business with us, such as to subscribe to print and e-mail publications, to register for conferences and seminars, to register for access to certain areas of Advisor Web sites, to buy products and services from Advisor, and to do anything else where users are asked to voluntarily provide information in order to participate. 

Certain activities are automatically logged by Web servers; this includes user IP addresses, URLs, pages visited, and sometimes cookies. Advisor aggregates and tabulates this information to analyze how the features and content of its Web sites are used. Some of this aggregated, tabulated information is provided to advertisers. Even if information about the activities of individuals should it exist, it would not be given to advertisers or anyone outside of Advisor without each individual's explicit permission. Some online advertising may come from third-party servers that log aggregate ad displays and clicks; any such information is never combined with the information logged by Advisor. 

Advisor never gives customer e-mail addresses to outsiders. E-mail is used for customer service, to provided requested information such as Advisor Tips, news and articles, and to announce new Advisor products and services. If a customer has asked to receive special offers and information from third-party companies, such e-mail is sent directly by Advisor, not by the third-party companies. Customers can always specify and change what kind of e-mail, what e-mail addresses, they prefer. However, if e-mail is not available or allowed, a customer may not be eligible for certain Advisor products and services. 

Advisor Web sites sometimes use cookies to create a personalized user experience and to move smoothly through the site. The format of Advisor cookies is proprietary and not available to any third-parties. 

Advisor does not solicit any information from children. Advisor's Web sites provide professional, business, technical and lifestyle information intended for adults. Whether or not it is suitable for children is up to their parents to determine. 

When Advisor provides links to other Web sites or advertisers, Advisor is not responsible for the privacy policies, content or business practices of those sites. The user is solely responsible for determining the suitability and value of any Web site or content.

If you have questions about this Privacy Statement or the practices of Advisor Web sites, please go to [ContactAdvisor](https://web.archive.org/ContactAdvisor) or write to [Privacy@Advisor.com](mailto:Privacy@Advisor.com).
