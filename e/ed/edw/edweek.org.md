**Information About Your Visit:**

In the course of delivering timely education news and information, we do not collect any personally identifying information about you, unless you specifically supply it to us (such as for registration or a product order). This information may be used by us for marketing of our own products to you or for sending messages on behalf of other organizations, but it is _never_ shared with other organizations for commercial or any other purpose. 

Our web server does automatically collect information about which pages are visited and the domain name (e.g., aol.com) of visitors. We use this general information only for traffic statistics and similar internal purposes. The server does not collect your e-mail address. 

_Education Week on the Web_ does have a relationship with DoubleClick Inc., a third-party ad-serving company. As a result of your visit to our site, DoubleClick may collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type, and whether you responded to the ad delivered. DoubleClick does not, however, collect any personally-identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. For further information, consult DoubleClick's privacy policy at [http://www.doubleclick.com:8080/privacy_policy](http://www.doubleclick.com:8080/privacy_policy/). 

_Education Week on the Web_ also has a relationship with ClickSmart.com, Inc., a third party Internet order fulfillment company. As a result of your visit to The BookShelf portion of our site, ClickSmart will collect only such personally identifying information about you as you supply. This information may be used by us for marketing our products to you, but ClickSmart and other third parties may not use the information for commercial or any other purposes (except, in ClickSmart's case, for fulfilling and communicating with you about your order). In addition, ClickSmart may collect non-personally identifying information about you, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type, and whether you purchased a product of a certain type. 

In order to process a product order or allow you to access registered content without a login and password, we may set "cookies." Cookies are small sets of data that are placed on your computer in order to keep track of what you view while on our site. Cookies do not collect personally identifiable information about you, and we do not use them for any purpose other than your convenience in ordering a product or accessing registered content. 

If our information practices ever change, we will post the changes to our Web site and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should periodically check our Web site, or write to [webeditor@epe.org](mailto:webeditor@epe.org). 

Product order forms you fill out on our site will normally be protected under an industry-standard secure process. (Your browser is part of this process, which is usually indicated by a picture of a closed lock, key, or similar symbol.) Your personal information and credit card information is encrypted when you send them to us through a secure page. 

If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, contact us at the above address or phone number, or e-mail us at [webeditor@epe.org](mailto:webeditor@epe.org).
