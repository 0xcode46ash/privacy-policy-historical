# the edWeb - Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy

Effective December 17, 2007

edWeb, LLC ("we" or "us") places the highest importance on respecting and maintaining your privacy. We hope the information provided here increases your confidence and the value you gain from using the edWeb website ([www.edweb.net](http://www.edweb.net/)) (the "Site,") and the services provided thereon (the "Services"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, protect, use and share information about you when you use the Site and/or Services. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the edWeb [User Agreement](http://www.edweb.net/userAgreement). Each time that you use the Site, you signify that you agree to be bound by the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the Services and terminate your membership. 

Information We Collect

When you visit the edWeb we collect two types of information: personal information you choose to disclose when you register or update your user profile, and information collected by us as you interact with the Site. 

User-Provided Information

We collect personal information from you when you register with our Site, update your profile, and use various features of our Site. When you register with the Site, you provide your full name, your email address, your job function, title and status, the institution where you work, and the city, state/province, zip/postal code, and country of your institution. We do not ask for any personal information such as your home address, phone number or any other information about you. When you complete our registration form you will be able to access the Site. Once you are registered, you have the option to add to your profile a personal photo and additional professional information including a brief biography, your areas of interest, and associations with whom you maintain affiliations. If you are interested in connecting with other members of the site for networking purposes, you also have the opportunity to select those areas from a checklist. We may also collect information regarding your interaction with other Users and your use of the Site. From time to time we may also collect information about you through other methods, including information we obtain from third parties, including verification services, data compilers, as well as public sources. We use this information to continually offer you the most value as an edWeb member. 

Each member of the edWeb has a personal home page and associated sub-pages connected to the personal home page. The personal home page displays the profile information described above, as well as any Content that you have uploaded or added to your personal home page. Your personal home page does not display your email address or the networking interests you may have selected in your profile. Your email address is not displayed anywhere publicly on the site, unless you choose to disclose it in any Content you post. Your networking interests are not displayed anywhere on the Site, either. These interests are used in our search functionality to enable like-minded members interested in similar topics to meet. 

By using the permission settings on your profile, you can control which members of the Site have access to your personal profile data. By default, these permission settings are set to show your profile only to members of the Site who are in your "My Contacts & Friends" list. You can change these settings at any time by going to the "My Settings" link in your personal navigation bar. You can set your profile to be seen by all members of the Site, only linked "Contacts & Friends," or even no one. 

Please note: the Site is a professional site and does not use screen names or nicknames to hide a member's identity. While you have control over who can access your profile and other Content on your home page, your full name and profile picture, if you have uploaded a photo, cannot be hidden and will always be viewable by all members of the Site when they visit your personal home page, when they access the Site's list of members, and when you add Content, such as a discussion or blog post, to a public community or the edWeb Forums. 

Your name and profile picture also will be available to all members of the Site when they use the Site's search functionality. This is primarily so your existing contacts and friends can find you and send a request to become a linked connection of yours on the Site. Members of the Site can also use the search function to find other members who share similar networking interests. However, members who see your name in search results will not be able to read your profile information unless they have a relationship with you (i.e. they are a linked Contact & Friend) or your privacy settings allow all members of the edWeb to access your profile. 

As an edWeb Member, you can share personal Content, such as a blog, files you have uploaded and multimedia such as photos. Please be aware that by using any of these features, your personally identifiable information may be accessible to other members of the edWeb, and we have no control over how other members may use your personally identifiable information. 

Profile information you submit to the Site and Content you post to your personal home page and sub-pages will be available to other members of the Site you allow to access the information through your privacy settings. You may set your privacy settings to allow all members of the edWeb to access your profile, only linked Contacts & Friends, or no one. These permissions are set within each of the tools provided on the personal home page. To protect your privacy, we recommend that you choose your profile and Content viewing preferences with care. We also recommend that you avoid posting personal or private information in discussions, on forums or blogs, or in any files you choose to upload and share with other members, as any information you provide may be viewable by other members of the Site and authorized edWeb staff. 

Security of Your Personal Information on the edWeb

Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your profile and the Content of your personal home and sub-pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We also cannot control the actions of other members whom you may allow to access your profile. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your profile will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. 

Cookies and Other Technologies We Use

When we track activity on the edWeb, we collect information such as your IP address, browser type and version, and pages you view. We receive an IP address each time you view the Site, because our server automatically reports it to us. We may collect your connection information including details of IP addresses, operating systems, browsers, versions, and the website that you visited prior to the Site (but not e-mail addresses) as part of our analysis of the Site. We would use this information in our business for various purposes, including diagnosing service or technology problems, assessing and maintaining system security, and/or displaying the most appropriate advertising or content. We do not track any URLs that you type into your browser that are not URLs associated with the Site and we do not track you across the Internet once you leave our Site. We gather this information for all edWeb members. By accessing the Site, you unconditionally consent to allow us to collect your connection information and use that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy for any purpose not prohibited by applicable law. 

We use "session cookies" to manage your experience on our Site. A session cookie is a small piece of information we ask your browser to send to us along with each request you make to view a page on our Site. We use this information so that you can best take advantage of the features of the Site during your visit. Your browser will no longer send session cookies to us either when you close your browser or when you log out. The next time you visit us, you will be given new session cookies. This is what differentiates session cookies from permanent cookies; permanent cookies are stored on your computer, and your browser will be able to send the same information during your visit as was sent during earlier visits. We do not use permanent cookies. 

Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can configure yours to refuse cookies or notify you when you've received one. Browsers differ, so check your "Help" menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences. However, if you reject cookies on the Site, you may not be able to access all areas of the Site or use some of its features. 

When we send you emails, we may use a variety of mechanisms including the use of embedded images to determine the number of members who open our emails. These images would also allow us to count users who have visited the Site and to deliver co-branded services. When you click on a link in an email, we may record this individual response to allow us to customize our offerings to you. Embedded images may also be used to conduct research on behalf of some partners on their websites for auditing purposes and/or to determine aggregate information about users, including demographic and usage information. Embedded images are not used to access your personally identifiable information, but they are a technique we may use to compile aggregated statistics about usage of the Site. Embedded images collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, originating IP address, and a description of the page on which the embedded images resides. If you find our Site using a search engine, the search engine and the search term used may be transmitted back to our ad-serving service providers via a cookie. This information is anonymous and does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. This information is used only in the aggregate to evaluate how users reach our site. 

In addition, some of our advertisers use third-party networks to serve their advertisements on the Site. Often, these third-party advertising companies use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to measure advertisement effectiveness. We do not control, nor do we have access to, their cookies or the information they obtain. Use of their tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies. 

Communities and the edWeb Forums

Members should be aware that Content they submit to edWeb communities is governed by a different set of permissions. On your personal home page, you can decide who may access your profile and your Content. In communities you belong to, permissions about who may belong to the community, and who may read, access and post to the community are determined by the community's administrator. All Content that individual members add to a community include the member's full name as well as a profile picture if the member has uploaded a photo to his or her profile. The administrator of each community formed on the edWeb is fully responsible for determining how other members of the edWeb may access the community and to what degree the community's discussions, blog, files and other Content are accessible to other members of the edWeb. A community may be public, private or hidden and the Content within the community may have a variety of policies governing how other members of the Site interact with it. 

Individual members should make themselves aware of a community's policies before posting Content to that community. Just as individuals bear full responsibility for their personal home page and sub-pages and how other members of the Site can access those pages, the community administrator for each community, and not us, is responsible for how content is displayed and accessible to other members of the edWeb within that particular community and for all activity that occurs within each community. Members of the edWeb should be aware that it is possible for a community that is marked as private or hidden to become public if the administrator of the community changes the community's access policy. 

The edWeb Forums are public forums available to all members of the edWeb. Unlike your personal home page or a private or hidden community you may belong to, the Forums are a public space on the Site. Your name, photo, if you've uploaded one, and any posts you make to these Forums are accessible to all members of the edWeb. As such, any personal information you disclose in these Forums can be collected and used by others, so it is important for you to exercise discretion and appropriate caution when deciding to reveal personal information in these areas. 

User Content

When you add Content to the Site, you do so at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your personal home page and sub-pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. 

We cannot control the actions of other members with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. We also cannot control how your Content may be viewed or accessed in a community that you have posted your Content to or that other members have posted your Content to. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for the failure or circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other members have copied or stored your Content. 

How We Use Your Information

We will not disclose any personally identifiable information about individual users, except as described in this Privacy Policy. With the few exceptions that we explain here, we do not give or sell individual information to our advertisers, although we may provide aggregate information. We may also use this aggregated information to help the advertisers reach the kind of audience they want. We may also disclose aggregate information (for example, information showing that a certain number of our members clicked on a particular advertising banner last month) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

As for individually identifiable information, we may disclose it only under the following circumstances: 

  * We may disclose information to others when we have your consent.
  * If you sign up for a special offer from an advertiser, we will provide your individual contact information (for example, name, mailing address, e-mail address, and/or telephone number), so that the advertiser or its agent can fulfill the special offer. Once the advertiser receives the information, it will handle the information under its own privacy policies. Obviously, if you do not want a particular advertiser to have your personal information, then you should not sign up for that advertiser's offer.
  * If you send e-mail from the Site, your address will appear as the return address of that e-mail
  * We may disclose your personal information as required by applicable law, or in response to legal process, to protect our rights or property, or to protect our safety or the safety of our users or others.
  * We may sometimes conduct mailings to other people's lists. To make it easier for us to comply with the federal law, we may share our e-mail list of people who have requested not to receive promotional communications from us with the list providers (or contractors) solely so that we can avoid sending e-mails to people who have asked not to receive them (or, conversely, so that our advertisers can avoid sending e-mails to people who have requested not to hear from them). We would provide these lists only to list providers or contractors that we consider to be reputable, and only under strict nondisclosure/nonuse agreements.
  * We may disclose personal information in some other limited circumstances, but we would specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in the rules of a contest or a new service. For example, if we were to give personal information to a contest's sponsor, we would disclose it when you sign up for the contest, so that you can decide whether to enter.
  * In developing our business, we might sell certain assets or the company, or parts of it, may be sold, merged or otherwise transferred. In such transactions, user information, whether personally identifiable or otherwise, may be one of the transferred assets. We will notify users of the Site of such a change in ownership or transfer of assets by posting a notice on the Site.
  * We may employ contractors or other third parties to help with our operations. We may give them access to databases of user information, so that they can perform their services for us, including performing system maintenance, performing list analysis or management, or sending mailings for us from our advertisers. These parties would all be subject to confidentiality agreements that restrict their use and disclosure of information they obtain through their relationship with us.
  * Our ad server delivers the ads appearing on the Site to you. Information such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information) is used to serve ads to you.



We may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes of personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we can provide you with the best possible experience while using the Site and our Services. The Site is an advertising-supported site and it is our intent to provide only advertisements that are useful to you. We use the information you provide in your profile to tailor advertisements to you. We believe this benefits you because you will see advertisements for products that are of interest to you. Without advertising, we would not be able to offer the Site to our members as a free service. Our own servers serve all advertisements that appear on the Site and in emails we may send to you. At no time does the Site ever provide any personally identifiable information about you to any advertiser on the Site. 

We may conduct research on our Users' demographics, interests, and behavior based upon the information you provide us when you participate in contests or other promotions on the Site, or based upon the information on our server log files. This research would be compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. We may also notify you of products, services, or areas of the Site that we think may interest you based on the information we've received. If you would prefer us not to contact you for these purposes, just send us an e-mail at info@edweb.net and let us know. 

We may use your registration information in the event we need to contact you regarding your profile, postings or other community activities or to inquire about your edWeb experience. Please see a detailed explanation of how email is used on the Site below. 

We collect search information that you enter in the Site to help us determine what our Users are interested in and to give us ideas for new content on the Site. This information is anonymous and used in the aggregate. 

In addition, we may use your personal information to: 

  * maintain internal records and for other internal administrative purposes;
  * compile statistical analysis of the Site for security and administrative purposes;
  * help us assess and develop our services to help serve you better including informing you of new services, alliances and other information which may be relevant to you (unless you have asked us not to); and
  * create an individual profile for you so that we can inform you of particular goods, services or events that may be of interest to you and to display that information according to your preferences.



We are under no obligation to verify the source of personal information provided about you, and will consider such information to have been provided or authorized by you. 

Email

Email communication is an important aspect of the Site and Service. We may use your personal information to send you emails for the following reasons: 

Service Related Emails

  * We may send you service-related announcements such as a Welcome Email, regular updates on new features on the site, or other information you may need to better utilize the Site and its Services, from time to time.
  * We may also send you newsletters from time to time. You may change your newsletter preferences (i) at any time by simply updating your account or (ii) by opting-out of receiving future newsletters as described at the bottom of each communication from us.



Transactional Emails

We will send you certain emails to alert you to communication on the Site, invitations you've received, or other transactions that require a response from you. Some examples of transactional emails you will receive include: 

  * When you join the site for the first time, you'll receive a Welcome Email from us with your password and information on getting the most out of your use of the Site;
  * When a member of the Site sends you a private message, you'll receive an email alerting you that you have a message waiting on the Site;
  * When a Member invites you to become a linked "Contact & Friend," you'll receive an email letting you know that you need to go to your home page to approve or deny the invitation;
  * When a Community invites you to become a member, you'll receive an email alerting you to the invitation and the action you need to take to join the community.



Notifications of Activity on the Site

Keeping our members alerted to the presence of new content on the edWeb is one of the most important aspects of our Service. Members receive email notifications about all new content that has been posted on the personal home pages of anyone in your Contacts & Friends list or in Communities of which you are a member. 

Examples of new content you may be notified about in an email notification may include: a new blog entry or a comment to a blog; a new community or personal discussion topic and all the responses to that topic; a new community blog entry or comments; a file upload such as a photograph and comments added; a new discussion topic and responses in the Forums section. 

For each member of your Contacts & Friends list, for each community you belong to, and for the edWeb Forums, you have the option to decide how you wish to be notified. By default, you will receive an email with the full text of new content or an email with a link to the new content but you have the option to change this for every one of your linked connections on the Site. From the personal home page, follow the link to My Settings>Subscriptions. Here you may choose to be alerted every time new content is added, receive an email digest of all new content once a day, or not to be alerted at all. Notifications of new activity may also appear on the your personal home page in the sections labeled "Activity in Your Contacts & Friends' Spaces" and "Activity in Your Communities." 

We reserve the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications. 

Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Certain parts of the Site use a secure web server, which allows web browser programs to interact with the server via an encrypted session using a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection between you and us. Users may move in and out of secured areas on the Site. You should be able to identify when you are in a secure area by "https" or a lock appearing on the screen. This will depend on the type of browser used. 

Do not share your password with anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. If you are using a computer to which others have access, such as one in a computer lab, Internet cafe, or public library, always remember to log out and close your browser window when leaving the Site. 

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information you disclose via the Site, including via e-mail. When disclosing any personal information, you should remain mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible by unauthorized persons and, consequently, may be collected by unauthorized persons and used without your consent. By disclosing any information, you accept the inherent security risks of providing information and dealing online over the Internet and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security (unless this is due to our sole negligence or willful misconduct). We disclaim all liability for the security of information transmitted through the Internet. 

If you have any questions about security on our Site, please use our [Contact Us](http://www.edweb.net/contact) form. 

Users under 18

Personal information about children is a concern for all of us, and we take the protection of children's privacy very seriously. The Site is not directed at children under the age of 18, and we do not encourage participation or visitation by children of any age. We operate the Site in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and will not knowingly collect, solicit or use personal information from anyone under the age of 18 or allow such persons to become members of the edWeb. If you are under 18, please do not attempt to register as a member or send any information about yourself to us. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from someone under the age of 18, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about someone under 18, please alert us through our [Contact Us](http://www.edweb.net/contact) form. 

Surveys

Occasionally we conduct surveys to better target our content to our audience or for the benefit of third parties with whom we do business. When we do so, we will let you know how we intend to use the information collected from the survey. Sometimes the aggregate survey results are shared with our advertisers and partners. We never share any survey information about specific response with any third party unless that individual consents. If you are not satisfied with the reasons for the survey, you may refrain from contributing to it. 

E-mail this Page to a Friend

Personal and community blogs on the Site include a feature that permits members to electronically forward posts to individuals who are not members of the edWeb by clicking on a link. The sender must provide the email address of the recipient. The sender's information is used to let the recipient know who sent the page or in the case of transmission errors. Neither the sender's information nor the recipient's information is used for any other purpose. 

Invitations to Join the edWeb

You may invite individuals who are [qualified](http://www.edweb.net/userAgreement#membershipEligibility) members of the education community to become a member of the Site and to become a linked "Contact & Friend" of yours. If you are the administrator of an edWeb community, you may invite individuals to join your community, or to join your community and be added as a personal linked "Contact & Friend." If you choose to use our invitation service for personal or community purposes, we will ask you for your contact or friend' email address. We will automatically send your contact or friend an email inviting him or her to join the edWeb and your community, if applicable. We store the email address used to send this invitation so that we can verify that the recipient has a valid invitation to join our Site and also to register a linked connection between you, your community, if applicable, and your contact or friend if he or she becomes a member of the edWeb. We do not use this information for any other purposes. 

Legal Matters

We may, without your consent, access and disclose your information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you or your account as may be permitted or required by law (including, but not limited to, court order or subpoena), or to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, violations of our [User Agreement](http://www.edweb.net/userAgreement), or activity that appears to us to be illegal or may expose us to legal liability. 

Links to Other Web Sites and Third Party Relationships

The Site may contain links to third-party web sites not operated by us. Links to other websites are provided solely as a convenience to you. It is possible for you to receive information directly from our partners and other companies if you access them through a link on the Site or if you go directly to their web sites. If you follow links from the Site to others, you should be aware that you are doing business with those other sites, which have their own privacy and data collection practices. This Privacy Policy only applies to the Site and the information we collect. We do not monitor those other websites nor do we have any control or responsibility for them, their content or their privacy policies. Consequently, we neither endorse nor make any representations about them, nor the privacy policies of those sites. We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies (and we may not even know what they are). For more information regarding a site and its privacy policies, check that site. For additional information about links to third-party sites, please review our [User Agreement](http://www.edweb.net/userAgreement). 

We have relationships with third parties to assist us in providing the Site and Service. These service providers act on our behalf and are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide them. For example, we may use service providers to host our Site and our Services. Service providers who host web pages and collect information on our behalf are strictly prohibited from using your information for their own purpose. Our contracts restrict service providers to use the personal information we disclose to them only to provide you the service you have requested. 

While we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any password and/or account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online, especially when using a computer that other people can use also. 

International Use

The Site and the servers that make the Site available worldwide are located in the United States, and this Privacy Policy applies to the operations of the Site in the United States. Any information you provide will be transferred to the United States. If you are using the Site from outside the United States, by providing your information to this Site, you are consenting to the transfer of your information to the United States for processing and maintaining in accordance with our Privacy Policy. You are also consenting to the application of United States law in all matters concerning this Site. 

Data handling practices and rules may differ from country to country. You agree to comply with all applicable local rules including but not limited to rules regarding online conduct and acceptable content. Specifically, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside. 

Changes to our Privacy Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. You should consult this Privacy Policy periodically to learn of such changes. The most recent version of the Privacy Policy will always be posted on the Site, with the "Effective Date" posted at the top of the Policy. We will inform you of any material change to this Privacy Policy that affects the way we handle your personally identifiable information by posting a notice on the Site. 

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or the practices of this Site, please use our [Contact Us](http://www.edweb.net/contact) form.
