This website (the "Site") is for information purposes only and the Terms of Use and this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) relate specifically to this Site and do not apply to websites operated by other Corus Entertainment companies, or other third parties, each of which has its own terms of use and privacy policies. Please read the respective sites' terms and policies when accessing those sites.

This Privacy Policy Statement supplements our general Terms of Service, which you must also read.

CFNYFM encourages parents and guardians to be aware of and participate in their children's online activities. Minors (persons under the age of majority in their province or territory of residence) may not use the Site unsupervised and we ask that you do not allow your child to submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect the personal information of minors beyond what is allowed under the Canadian Marketing Association's Code of Ethics & Standards of Practice as they relate to marketing to children on the Internet.
