Privacy Policy  
Section 1 – How your information is used.  
Most websites collect information from their visitors. This includes IP address, browser type, and referring page. Cookies are used to remember the visitor’s preferences for interacting with the website. That said, the information Drone Friend gathers will be used to enhance the visitor’s experience and may be used to target advertising. Your email address will not be sold to third parties, but if provided, your email may be used to inform you of news from us and to receive discounts/give aways from vegan friendly companies.  
Section 2 – Consent  
If you provide us with any kind of personal information, it is implied that you’re consenting us to collect it. If we request additional personal information for a secondary reason, marketing for example, we will ask you directly for your consent, or give you the opportunity to say no.
