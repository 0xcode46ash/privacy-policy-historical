**LAST UPDATED:  **3rd January 2012 

**Privacy Policy**

We Warner Music UK Limited **** are concerned about online privacy and we want you to understand how we collect, use and disclose your personal information.  This Privacy Policy applies to the Warner Music or artist site (“Site”) from which you are linking to it.  By using the Site you agree to this Privacy Policy. ****

**1.             ****What Types of Information Do We Collect From You?**

We gather three basic types of information through the Site: “ **Personally Identifiable Information** ” (or “ **PII** ”), “ **Non-Personally Identifiable Information** ” (or “ **Non-PII** ”) and “ **IP Addresses.** ” 

**Personally Identifiable Information** identifies a person as an individual.  You do not have to provide PII to use the Site, but we may ask that you do so when we are providing opportunities to you through the Site. The information we ask for will depend on what opportunity we are providing but may include your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, and for purchases, your credit card number including any validation code.   We may also provide functionality so that you can send messages about Site-related content to a friend, for example music clips or artist information.  By using this functionality, you affirm that you are entitled to provide us with the recipient’s name and e-mail address for this purpose.  ****

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information** does not personally identify you. It may include your MAC address, your computer type, screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other similar technologies to better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing use of our Site.  It may also include demographic data, for example your location. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies.  To learn more about cookies, please visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>.  

**IP Addresses.   **Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  This number is logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time of your visit and the pages that you visited.  Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites. 

**2.                ****How Do We Use The Information We Collect?**

**Personally Identifiable Information.   **We may use PII:

·           to fulfill your requests such as to send newsletters to you or complete your purchases.

·           to send you important information about the Site, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.  Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving these communications.

·           to tell you about any artists, products, programs, services and promotions we believe may be of interest to you. 

·           to send messages you have chosen to send to a friend through the Site. We will not use your friend’s PII except to enable the message to be sent, unless we disclose any other use purpose to you when you provide this PII.  Your friend will be able to see your name and email address. 

·           for internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of promotional campaigns.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information.**   This does not personally identify you. We may use this information and share it with our affiliates and other third parties for any purpose.  We may combine Non-PII with PII, such as combining your geographic location with your name, but if we do this the information will be treated by us as PII for so long as it is combined.  We may aggregate PII such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example by using PII to calculate the percentage of our users who like a particular artist. 

**IP Addresses.**   We use IP addresses for the same purposes for which we use PII and in addition for calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Site and your use of it including providing opportunities to you and fulfilling your requests and purchases.  Except where otherwise required by law, we treat IP Addresses, server log files and related information as Non-PII. 

**Legal Requirements.**  We may use PII, Non-PII and IP Addresses for any purpose required or permitted by the law of any country.
