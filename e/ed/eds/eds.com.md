This privacy statement has been created by EDS in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to data protection and privacy.

**Privacy and Data Protection at www.eds.com**  
In accordance with the EDS Privacy and Web Data Protection Policy, the following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: 

**Use** : The site collects data through a feedback form that allows users to request information about EDS and its products and services. For this purpose we request and collect user's contact information, consisting of name and e-mail address. The form also allows a user to provide other information as he or she may desire to provide such as contact information, resumes, and business alliance related data. Information so collected is used solely for the purpose of responding to the request of the user. Such request may include provision of the EDS newsletter and if so, the user's contact information will be used for mailings of such information by EDS. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Opt-Out section below. 

Users may also incidentally submit to EDS other sensitive personal data -- like political opinions, opinions related to specific employees, or open business proposals. Such unsolicited information is considered non-confidential and nonproprietary by our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/administrative/legal.shtml) statement.

The site also provides a capability for users to submit their resumes to EDS via e-mail. Any resume so received by EDS will be held in confidence and used only for the purpose of considering the submitting party for employment or such other purpose as requested by the submitting party. Such information is not shared with third parties unless specifically requested or authorized by the submitting party.

We may use user IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and administer our Web site, to analyze trends, to track user movement and use, and to gather broad demographic information. Such data is not linked to any personally identifiable information. 

Use of the site does not require registration and we do not use cookies (except see 'Site Survey' below). 

Data submitted to the site may be transferred within EDS, including to subsidiaries, strictly in order to fulfill or expedite a user's request. Data submitted to this site will not be shared or sold to any outside parties, unless specifically requested by the user; the only exceptions to this being in response to a court order or other legal obligation. 

eds.com links to other outside Web sites and eds.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. Users should check their privacy policies (if available) before submitting any personal information since the privacy practices of these other sites may be different from that of eds.com. In some cases, when a user links to another Web site, the user may still see the EDS logo and template. Any easy way to verify this is by checking the location bar within your browser. Users should be aware that any personal information collected is collected by that third party Web site and is governed by that site's policy. 

****  


**Retention** : Data submitted to www.eds.com will be deleted within 3 months of our fulfillment of the request, unless retained for further communication (see Use above). 

Correct/Update: Users may change or modify information previously provided to this site through e-mail to info@eds.com. 

**Security** : This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Any EDS employee who may have access to such information is aware of the EDS Privacy and Web Data Protection Policy through direct notification and training. Access to such information is limited to those required to fulfill the applicable user request, and security procedures in place include password protection and, as appropriate, alphanumeric passwords, physical protection or encryption. 

****

**Opt-Out** : Users may opt-out of receiving further communications through e-mail to [info@eds.com](mailto:info@eds.com). If you already receive the eds.com newsletter and wish to unsubscribe, please complete the [unsubscribe form](https://web.archive.org/news/news_unsubscribe.shtml). 

**Notification of Changes** : In the event of any material changes by EDS of its EDS Privacy and Web Data Protection Policy that may impact the practices described on this Web site will be prominently posted on this site. In no event will any such changes to this policy apply with respect to data previously collected through this site. If at any point eds.com decides to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that which was stated at the time it was collected, they will notify you by e-mail, and you will be given a choice to your personally identifiable information being transferred.

****

**Site Survey** : Users may be invited to participate in a site survey. You may opt-out of participation at the time the survey is offered. The survey collects generalized statistics only. No personal data is held as a result of the site survey, unless you opt to provide specific comments and/or your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information. In this case your comments and address information will be passed directly to EDS and subject to the same provisions and safeguards as provided for information collected on the eds.com Web site. Contact for personal data submitted via the survey is [info@eds.com](mailto:info@eds.com). Personal data submitted through the survey will be used only by EDS, and only in order to respond to, and where appropriate to action, your comments. 

**Juniors** : We do not intentionally invite data from Juniors (under the age of 13) to this site, but where we are aware of such submissions for educational purposes, we will treat such data as ‘Sensitive Data’. Data known to be from Juniors and which is not specifically submitted for educational purposes will be immediately deleted.
