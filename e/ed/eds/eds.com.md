# About eds.com: Privacy and Data Protection Policy | eds.com

EDS believes in your right to privacy and data protection. We have created this privacy statement in conjunction with the EDS Web Privacy and Data Protection Policy with your needs in mind.

The following topics address our information gathering abilities, our philosophy on handling personal data and our privacy practices.

Data Collection and Registration 
    

The site collects data through a feedback form that allows users to request information about EDS and its products and services. For this purpose we request and collect user's contact information, consisting of first name, last name, position title and e-mail address. The form also allows a user to provide such other information as he or she may desire to provide. Information so collected is used solely for the purpose of responding to the request of the user. Such request may include provision of EDS news releases and if so, the user's contact information will be used for mailings of such information by EDS. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Opt-Out section below. 

Use of the site may require registration in some areas where EDS deems it necessary to track user information. Registration may be required for proprietary information, marketing analysis, and/or lead generation. All personally identifiable information that is collected in the registration process will be housed on a database or databases in the United States of America and subject to the applicable laws of that country. Use of registrant’s information will be used solely for the purposes of supplying marketing related material that the registrant has opted-in for in the registration process. Registered users will have the option to change permissions and opt-out of any and/or all communication. 

The site also provides a capability for users to submit their resumes to EDS via e-mail. Any resume so received by EDS will be held in confidence and used only for the purpose of considering the submitting party for employment or such other purpose as requested by the submitting party. Such information is not shared with third parties unless specifically requested or authorized by the submitting party.

We may use user IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and administer our Web site, to analyze trends, to track user movement and use, and to gather broad demographic information. Such data is not linked to any personally identifiable information. Personal information provided by the user may also be collected for the purposes of internal marketing research, user trend studies and sitewide improvements. Such data will not be shared with third parties and is used solely to improve our understanding of our audience.

EDS may use cookies for the purpose of improving user experience and to facilitate the transfer of data between the site and the individual. 

Data submitted to the site may be transferred within EDS, including to subsidiaries and approved third parties strictly in order to fulfill or expedite a user's request. Data submitted to this site will not be shared or sold to any other outside parties, unless specifically requested by the user.

We do this by using cookies – a small piece of data that our site sends to a person's computer where it is stored.

Access to such information is limited to those required to fulfill the applicable user request, and security procedures in place include password protection and, as appropriate, physical protection.

Policy on Data Collection from Juniors (under the age of 13)

Data known to be from Juniors and which is not specifically submitted for educational purposes will be immediately deleted.

Site Survey Participation 
    

Users may be invited (by pop-up screen) to participate in a site survey carried out by an independent organization. You may opt-out of participation at the time the survey is offered. The survey collects generalized statistics only. No personal data is held as a result of the site survey, unless you opt to provide specific comments.
