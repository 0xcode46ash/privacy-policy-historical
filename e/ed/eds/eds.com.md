# EDS Privacy Policy

Usually, you can surf eds.com without submitting any information about yourself. Sometimes we may request a few particulars, such as your name and e-mail address. This is necessary for correspondence, providing subscriptions, and so forth. But we'll always let you know why we need such information and how it will be used. We'll also provide you with a means to "opt out" if you don't want us to collect your name, e-mail address, etc. 

As far as "cookies" are concerned, we would only use them to enhance the content you would see. "Cookies" is the cute little name for an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. This would allow us to customize information of specific interest to you. You always have the option of setting your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, allowing you to determine whether to accept it or not. Check with your browser manufacturer for details. 

There are links to other Web sites from eds.com. However, EDS is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites.
