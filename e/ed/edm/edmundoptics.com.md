# Privacy Policy - Edmund Optics

Edmund Optics, Inc. (EO) and its global subsidiaries recognize the importance of your privacy. To ensure that your needs with regard to this are being met, please take a few moments to familiarize yourself with our policy.

### B2B

Edmund Optics is a business-to-business company and is not oriented to the consumer market. As a result, we do not compile, buy, sell, rent or trade consumer mailing lists. Nor do we compile, buy, sell, rent or trade personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, or data concerning health or sex life. All marketing efforts we undertake are targeted toward a business audience only. Additionally, we do not knowingly collect - nor do we want - private information from minors. Children (under age 16) should always request the permission of a parent or guardian before sending personal information to us, or to anyone else online.

### Information Collected by Edmund Optics

Edmund Optics collects information about users' activities during their visits to our websites and interactions with our staff.

The information collected may include name, company, mailing address, e-mail address, phone and fax numbers, and other demographic/firmographic information. We also collect and aggregate information about which web pages our visitors access. Our cookies are primarily designed to retain ordering and registration information for customer convenience, to avoid re-keying data. These cookies reside on your hard drive and can be deleted by you at anytime. 

### What We Do With the Information We Gather

The primary use of the information is to improve our ability to meet your needs. We analyze this information to improve the content and delivery of our marketing communications and to determine whether to add or subtract products or services. We also use this information to contact our customers to apprise them of new products, services and promotions. Customers who supply us with their mailing address or telephone number may be contacted to confirm or reference online or print catalog orders. At times, this information may also be used as part of our ongoing marketing efforts. In cooperation with third party vendors, the EO websites use cookies to track and aggregate information on site usage and to help deliver the most relevant advertising and promotions to our website visitors. Edmund Optics may, from time to time, share our customer lists with other reputable organizations that may use the information for marketing purposes. We will also disclose information concerning you when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or property of Edmund Optics.
