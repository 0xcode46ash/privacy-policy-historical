**Edmunds.com Privacy Statement and Disclosure**

Edmunds.com is committed to protecting your privacy. Edmunds.com does not collect personally identifying information except when you specifically and knowingly provide it. Except as set forth below, Edmunds.com will not sell, rent, loan, trade or give away your telephone number or email address to third parties without your explicit permission. Internally, we password protect all personally identifying information to aid in preventing unauthorized access.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**  
Personally identifying information (e.g., your name, postal address, etc.) may be required to receive certain products, services or catalogs. If you agree and/or give your consent, this information may be shared with our partners or other third parties to help us improve our services or to notify you about additional products and services. That is, you may receive information from other companies or entities whose products or services may be of interest to you via email, regular mail or other conventional or electronic means. In addition, Edmunds.com may disclose personally identifying information upon receipt of legal process seeking such information, or if Edmunds.com determines that disclosure of such information (1) is required by law, (2) is reasonably necessary to enforce the Edmunds.com Town Hall Participant Agreement, or (3) is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Edmunds.com, its users, or other persons or entities. Under the foregoing circumstances, Edmunds.com may disclose personally identifying information without first notifying you or obtaining your consent.

**Edmunds.com Shares Non-Personal Aggregate, Statistical Information**  
Edmunds.com may share non-personal aggregate, or summary, information about our visitors with partners or other third parties, which is a customary practice on the Internet. For example, we might provide a count of our users from a particular zip code.

**Edmunds.com Uses "Cookies" to Improve Your Experience**  
Edmunds.com uses a standard Web browser feature called "cookies" to help us improve your experience. With the exception of Town Hall, cookies are not used to determine your identity. Cookies merely provide us with a unique and anonymous number that we can use in identifying -- and enhancing -- the use of sections of our site. In Town Hall, we use cookies to distinguish you from other users; and, if you so choose, to store your user name and encrypted password. You may choose to disable cookies in your browser or use security software to prevent the storage of cookies.

**If You Agree, Edmunds.com Will Email You Relevant Information from Third Parties**  
If you have indicated that you are interested in additional information at the time you give us your email address, Edmunds.com may email you information we believe you will find useful, including information about new products and services from our selected partners. We implement strict anti-spam measures to ensure that you receive only information that is relevant to you.

**Town Hall**  
Town Hall members are required to provide a valid email address as a condition of registration. This address will be private to the general membership, unless you chose to display it in your Town Hall User Profile. Town Hall members will be placed on our mailing list only by their explicit request. Edmunds.com reserves the right to contact you with this email address regarding our community policies or other matters relating to your participation in Town Hall. Visitors to Edmunds.com may freely read Town Hall postings without registering or providing an email address.

**Edmunds.com is Not Responsible for Privacy Practices of Partner Companies You May Visit**  
Edmunds.com presents advertisements and links to other companies. When you click on these links, you may be transferred to another company's Web site and information you provide to Edmunds for delivery to an advertiser may be transferred to that company. Edmunds.com has no control over the privacy practices of these other Web sites or companies, or information that these sites may request of you. We are not and cannot be held responsible for the privacy practices or content of third parties.

**Ordering Catalogs from Selected Edmunds.com Partners Will Indicate Your Consent to Receive Other Materials…**  
If you order catalogs from Edmunds.com advertisers (such as JC Whitney), any such order will indicate your consent to receive from them other catalogs, announcements, product news, newsletters, and/or other information, that may or may not be of interest to you.

You may always remove your personal information from Edmunds.com. To do so, simply send a message to that effect to [remove@edmunds.com.](mailto:remove@edmunds.com.) Town Hall users may delete their account by so requesting through the Help link on any Town Hall page.
