We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other Web sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information. This Privacy Statement applies solely to the information we collect on the ED-JOIN Web site, and does not apply to information we collect in any other fashion.

**Collection and Retention of Information**

In some areas of our Web sites, ED-JOIN requests or may request that you provide personal information, including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone, social security number, contact information and any other information from which your identity is discernible. In other areas, ED-JOIN collects or may collect demographic information that is not unique to you such as your ZIP code, age, preferences, gender or interests. Sometimes we collect or may collect a combination of the two types of information. Examples of areas on ED-JOIN Web sites where we collect personal or combined personal and demographic data are the ED-JOIN Interest Card and the online Job Application.

We also gather or may gather certain information about your use of our site, such as what areas you visit and what services you access.

Since we believe that managing your career is a life-long process, we retain indefinitely all the information we gather about you in an effort to make your repeat use with us more efficient, practical, and relevant. Of course, you can correct or update your ED-JOIN account profile and resume at any time. Moreover, you can delete your resume and profile from our online database or close your ED-JOIN account at any time, in which event your ED-JOIN account profile information will no longer be searchable by the educational organizations that use ED-JOIN to post jobs.

**Use of Cookies**

The ED-JOIN web site uses "cookies" to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize ED-JOIN pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. When you return to the ED-JOIN site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized.

You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on the ED-JOIN Web site.

**Updating Your Information**

You may review, correct, update or change your ED-JOIN account profile information at any time. Simply log into your ED-JOIN account, go to My Profile, review your account information and, if you wish, edit it with the options provided.
