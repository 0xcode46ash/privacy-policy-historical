Our secure e-commerce website was powered by [RegNow](http://www.regnow.com/) and Swreg, the division of Digital River, based in the USA.

Digital River has taken great precautions to ensure that your card information is kept a secret. RSA security is generally regarded as on of the strongest available. Please visit their site for more information. With these security precautions in place, your order is at least as secure, if not more than it is when you call in a phone order to a mail-order software house.
