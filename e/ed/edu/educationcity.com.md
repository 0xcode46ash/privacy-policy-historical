# Privacy Policy | EducationCity

**Being an online organisation and with digital technology at the heart of everything we do, online safety for our customers is paramount, especially as the majority of our users are students of primary school age. EducationCity complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).**

**In-Product Data Collection and Use**

EducationCity provides a personalised experience for its users. Account information for EducationCity users including administrators, teachers and students are password-protected so that only the user, account administrators and teachers have access to this personal information. By requiring users to log in, students using EducationCity can access the relevant content and their progress can be monitored.

We recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone to keep your data secure. EducationCity will never ask you for your password when contacting you by phone or email. EducationCity automatically logs users out after one hour of inactivity if they are logged in as an individual user. When you have finished using EducationCity, we recommend that you log out. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account information if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library.

EducationCity enables teachers and administrators to create and set up their own account. This allows teachers to upload and manage their own classes, set work and monitor progress with added security. To create an account on EducationCity the following information is required.

**Teachers and Administrators** We ask teachers and administrators to input the following in order to create an account: 

  * Title
  * First Name
  * Last Name
  * Email Address
  * Username
  * Password
  * Role (optional)



**Students**

When creating a new student account, we require a teacher or administrator to enter or upload the following information:

  * First Name
  * Last Name
  * Username
  * Password
  * Class
  * Unique ID (optional)
  * Academic Level (optional)
  * Date of Birth (optional)
  * Gender (optional)



Any work completed by a student (when logged in) is saved and stored against their profile and made available for the student and teachers to review and analyse within the EducationCity product.

For the purposes of a Home Educator’s subscription, we will also require the following details of the main account holder in order to manage the subscription:

  * Name
  * Email
  * Full Address (including postcode and country)
  * Contact Number



At all times, within the definition of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the school (or home educator) and its employees retain the status of Data Controller for the data stored on our cloud service. The data obtained from the school’s systems always remains in the ownership of the school, or that of the individual (employed) users. EducationCity shall be the Data Processor for the purposes of the GDPR.

**Data Sharing, Retention & Storage**

EducationCity has a strict policy of not sharing any information about students with anyone outside the organisation. EducationCity will not share data with third parties and we will never sell user information or data collected from our website.

**Sub-Processors**

EducationCity uses sub-processors to facilitate communications and support of your subscription. We remain the data processor of your data and these sub-processors only process your data in accordance with our strict instructions. We periodically audit our sub processors to ensure they comply with GDPR and our contract. We currently use the following sub-processors:

  * **Marketo (www.marketo.com)** – provide marketing services that allow us to manage teachers’ and administrators’ communication preferences, including delivery and tracking of email campaigns.
  * **Click4Assistance (www.click4assistance.co.uk)** – provide our in-product instant messaging/assistance service to teachers and administrators. Information regarding how the data is processed and stored when you use the Live Chat service can be viewed [here](https://www.click4assistance.co.uk/click4assistance-web-chat-software-cookie-policy) _._
  * **Whatfix (www.whatfix.com)** – provide our in-product help and support services to teachers and administrators. We use cookies and anonymised user IDs, no identifiable account information is shared.  



**Security & Protection of Your Information**

All remote access to the EducationCity web application is conducted over HTTPS, an encrypted web link secured using TLS (Transport Layer Security). This is the same method used by banks and commercial entities to secure sensitive data from interception.

**Data Deletion**

EducationCity stores data for its users. To ensure that EducationCity does not hold user information in perpetuity, it has set criteria for the deletion of unused data. This information will be deleted daily based on the below data types:

  * **Users** – EducationCity holds data for Teacher, Student and Admin user accounts. If these accounts are left inactive for two years they will be deleted. The definition of inactive is if the user has not logged in (via any route) for two years.
  * **SuccessTracker** – Any saved score data will be deleted after five years on a rolling basis. Even if the student is still active, we will only hold five years’ worth of results per child; if more is required, the export data feature should be used. If a student is deleted as a result of being inactive for two years, all score data held for that student is also deleted. Data to be deleted includes Activity, Assessment and PlayLive scores, and Revision Journals.
  * **MyCity** – If a Teacher or Admin user is deleted due to being inactive for two years, or a Teacher or Admin user is deleted via the user interface/front end, then their MyCities become ‘un-owned’. Any MyCities that contain no content will be deleted after two years. No MyCities will be deleted for an active user.



**Usage Statistics**

Usage statistics of EducationCity at school level will be stored in EducationCity’s subscriber management system and will be kept in perpetuity. No personal/user level information can be extracted from this data.

**External Data Storage**

EducationCity stores data on our secure database servers. The servers are housed in secure data centres, trusted and used by many of the country’s leading organisations. Physical access to our servers is strictly limited to data centre staff, our own IT staff and accompanied external contractors when needed, in order to maintain the servers. Access to the servers in the data centre requires proof of identity (photo ID) and is controlled by magnetic card readers and keys to both the cages and individual cabinets that surround the server racks, all of which are monitored by the data centre security staff using CCTV. Remote access to the data is limited to the tools needed by the IT support staff to maintain and operate the servers and is restricted to known users (identified by usernames and secure keys) connecting from known locations (IP addresses).

**Data Backup**

EducationCity’s backup procedure allows for storage for typically up to nine days and includes a full backup at the end of every working day, which is stored securely off-site.

**Transfer of Data Outside of the European Economic Area**

All data entered and saved on the EducationCity product is stored and backed up on secure database servers within the UK. Any email communication with us will go through our email system (Microsoft Office 365) which is held on Privacy Shield compliant servers held in the USA.

**Access to Information**

The General Data Protection Regulation gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the regulations.

**EducationCity Employees**

To ensure that the user receives the best customer care, EducationCity’s staff have access to user data (dependent upon their role). Staff access is controlled via documented System Access Requests and is only granted on a need-to-know basis.
