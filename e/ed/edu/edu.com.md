 **Registration Form**  
Our site's registration form gathers contact information (like your name and address), unique identifiers (like your student ID number and e-mail address) and demographic information (like your zip code, age, school, major and graduation date). We use contact information from the registration form to verify your status as a student and to send the free merchandise or coupons that you may receive in exchange for becoming a registered member of the edu.com Web site.

Unique identifiers (such as your student ID number and e-mail address) are collected to verify your identity and for use as account numbers in our record system. edu.com does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor your experience at our site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in and displaying the content according to your preferences. This information is shared with edu.com's partners on an aggregate basis. Although edu.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third parties, these statistics do not include any personally identifying information. **Checkout Process**  
Our site uses an order form to request products and services. We collect contact information (like your shipping address), unique identifiers (like your name and telephone number), financial information (like your credit card number), and demographic information (like your zip code).

We use this information to provide a high level of customer service, help you track your orders and offer personalized products and content that we think you would find helpful. Demographic and profile data is also collected during the checkout process. This information may be shared with third parties on an aggregate basis, but no personal information is ever shared. **Online Surveys**  
Our online surveys ask for contact information (like your name), unique identifiers (like your e-mail address), financial information (like your account or credit card number), and demographic information (like your zip code, age or income level).

edu.com lets you send e-mail messages with information about products, feature articles, registration instructions or the contents of your Wish List to a friend. We do not use the names or e-mail addresses you provide for any other purpose other than to send your e-mails. We do not rent, sell or trade these e-mail addresses. In fact, edu.com does not store these e-mail addresses; they are discarded after your e-mail is sent. **Outside Links**  
edu.com contains links to other sites, in order to provide you with third-party product reviews and other content we believe would be of value to you. In addition, to take advantage of some of the products and services offered on the edu.com site, you'll also need to provide some personal information to our third-party business partners when their sites are framed within the edu.com site. For example, if you apply for a credit card or to open a bank account on the edu.com site, you'll be required to provide certain personal information to the third party providing the service. edu.com is not responsible for the privacy practices, content or actions of other Web sites you may link to from our site. We suggest you check the privacy policies of other sites to learn about their information gathering and dissemination practices, including the use of cookies. **Cookies**  
A cookie is a data file that your browser places on your computer's hard drive when you visit some Web sites. A cookie cannot be used to find out your identity, gather information from your computer or read cookie files created by other Web sites.

Cookies allow edu.com to create an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience for you. 

Using cookies, edu.com is able to: 

  * Offer you products and content specific to your interests. The cookie may be used to track the pages you visit on the Web site, so that edu.com can tell you about similar or related products and content that may be of interest to you. 
  * Eliminate the need for you to log in each time you visit the site. The cookie automatically logs you in, eliminating the need for you to enter your username and password. 

  
**Automated login:** edu.com offers users the option of automated login. You control whether edu.com stores a cookie on your computer for the purpose of recognizing you each time you visit edu.com. When you choose this option, edu.com generates a cookie from a random string of characters. When you visit edu.com, the cookie automatically logs you in, eliminating the need for you to enter your username and password. The cookie may also be used to track the pages you visit on the edu.com Web site, so we can offer content and products of interest to you.

**Shopping Professor:** The edu.com Web site contains a feature called the Shopping Professor, which is designed to provide users with an effective and friendly method to search for hardware and software products. The Shopping Professor requires the use of cookies in order to function.

When you enter the Shopping Professor, a temporary, memory-based cookie is placed on your browser. The cookie serves as a private and encrypted data string that lets the Shopping Professor function properly and suggest products based on the answers you provide. The cookie is not written to your hard drive and cannot be used to find out your identity or to gather personal information from your computer. The temporary cookie is permanently removed from your computer and the edu.com server when you close your browser.

If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser.

If your browser doesn't support cookies or if you've disabled them, you will not be able to use the Shopping Professor or take advantage of automated login. However, you do not need to have cookies turned on to use the edu.com Web site.

 **Sharing Information**  
**Personal Information**  
Personal information is the unique data – such as your name, e-mail address, shipping address, student identification number, telephone number and credit card information – that identifies you as an individual. Your personal information is used by edu.com, our suppliers and shippers in order to verify your status as a student and to process your orders. edu.com does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to any third party. edu.com cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, such as fraud investigations and subpoenas, and divulges information when necessary to comply with state and federal laws. 

When you purchase a magazine at edu.com, your personal information is used by edu.com, our suppliers and shippers in order to verify your status as a student and to process your orders. edu.com does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to any third party. However, the magazine publisher who receives your information may share it with a third party. Whenever you put a magazine in your shopping cart at edu.com, you receive a message advising you that, while edu.com does not share your information, the magazine publisher may do so. If you choose not to have your information shared, you are able to remove the magazine from your shopping cart.

In some cases, edu.com receives information that you've provided to third parties. For example, if you buy a book on the edu.com site through one of our third-party partners, you earn eduPoints. To ensure your account is properly maintained, the third-party partner lets us know that you purchased a product or service and edu.com credits the eduPoints to your account.

 **Aggregate Information**  
edu.com shares demographic data, sales, traffic patterns and related site information with our partners and other reputable third parties in aggregate form only. The shared aggregate data does not include any personal information. **Security Procedures**  
We strive to make shopping at edu.com as safe as possible by using the state-of-the-art technology available today. Our Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software is the industry standard and among the best for secure electronic commerce transactions. The software encrypts all of your personal information, including your name, address and credit card number, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.

There are two ways to ensure that you are sending information over a secure connection. First, the padlock icon in your browser looks "locked" whenever you're sending information to a secure server. In addition, the first characters of the URL (or Web site address) in your browser change from "http" to "https" when a secure connection is established.

edu.com also has security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information once it's under our control. All information is stored in a secure database behind a firewall designed to prevent unauthorized access and none of the information can be retrieved via the Internet.

To provide you with an additional layer of security, all credit card numbers are stored on a computer that is not connected to the Internet. After you type, fax or call in your credit card number, it's transferred to our secure computer. This computer is not accessible by network or modem and your credit card number is not stored anywhere else. In addition, all credit card numbers stored in the secure computer are encrypted as an added security measure.

We guarantee that every transaction you make at edu.com will be 100% safe. You pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at edu.com. (For full details, read our [Safe-Shopping Guarantee](http://www.edu.com/helpdesk/helpdesk.asp?page=buyingpage&edusid=26CDF85520DF11D48AF200508B0AA004#safe_shopping).)

edu.com does not supplement the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties. **Opt-Out Policy**
