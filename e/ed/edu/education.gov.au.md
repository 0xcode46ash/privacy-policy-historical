### DEEWR Privacy Policy

© Commonwealth of Australia 2009

All personal information collected by the Department is protected by the _Privacy Act 1988_. Information on the Commonwealth _Privacy Act 1988_ can be found on the [Federal Privacy Commissioner’s web site](http://www.privacy.gov.au/).

### DEEWR’s Privacy Policy

The Australian Government Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (the Department) is committed to protecting the privacy of personal information. This Privacy Policy embodies this commitment and applies to personal information collected by the Department and its contractors and agents (collectively, the Department).

The Department adheres to the requirements of the Information Privacy Principles contained within the _Privacy Act 1988_ and the Guidelines for Federal and ACT Government World Wide Websites, issued by the Federal Privacy Commissioner.

### Information we collect and how we use it

The Department helps the Australian Government achieve its overall objective of quality educational, employment and training outcomes for all Australians through:

  * efficient national program management  

  * effective working relationships with state and territory governments, education departments, non-government education, science and training authorities, Indigenous education service providers, industry, community groups and other stakeholders  

  * auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services, and  

  * policy advice and other support to the Minister.  




Generally, the Department collects personal information in order to properly and efficiently carry out its functions, and only uses personal information for the purposes for which it was given to the Department and for directly related purposes (unless otherwise required by or authorised under law). 

In addition to this general Privacy Policy, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we publish separate privacy notices to describe how we will handle personal information that we collect. For example, where we ask you to provide personal information in relation to a particular program administered by the Department, we will provide you with a privacy notice which details our practices in relation to that particular program. 

### Communication - emails and Electronic Forms

The Department’s servers may record your email address if you send us a message online. Your email address will not be added to a mailing list, unless you have provided it to us in order to subscribe to one of our subscription services, such as the Department’s Site Change Subscription Service or the Department’s Media Subscription Service.

Where you choose to send us a completed electronic form that includes your personal details, we collect personally identifiable information, such as name, address and email address.

The information collected by email or electronic forms will be used only for the purpose for which you provided it, and we will not disclose it unless one of the circumstances described below under the heading “Information Sharing” has been satisfied. For those who do not wish to use the internet, the Department provides alternative ways of providing information. For example, forms may be printed and lodged by post.

  * Where you have consented  

  * Where we believe on reasonable grounds that the disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to your life or health or that of another person  

  * Where the disclosure is required or authorised by or under law, or   

  * Where the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or for the protection of the public revenue.



### Information security

We take all reasonable steps:

  * to protect the personal information that we hold against loss, against unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure and against other misuse, and   

  * to ensure that, where we have given personal information to a contractor (that carries out service for the Department), that contractor complies with the Information Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act. 



### Data integrity

We take reasonable steps to make sure that the personal information we collect and store is accurate, relevant, up to date, complete and not misleading.
