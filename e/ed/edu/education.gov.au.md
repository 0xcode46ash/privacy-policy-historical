### Security of Information

You should be aware that there are inherent risks associated with the transfer of information via the Internet. For those who do not wish to use the Internet, there are alternative ways of providing information. For example, forms may be printed and lodged by post. To improve security of personal information, some electronic forms that collect this information may collect using the HTTPS protocol (Hypertext Transport Protocol Secure), a standard Web Communications protocol that encrypts and decrypts a message for online transmission. You should check with the site.
