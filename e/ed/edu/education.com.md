# Privacy Policy | Education.com

Effective Date: May, 2012

## Overview

This is our policy regarding the privacy of information we collect on our web sites: Education.com (collectively, the “Websites”). This Privacy Policy includes examples of the types of personal information we collect and the kinds of companies with whom we share such information. These examples are illustrative and should not be considered a complete inventory of our information collection, use and sharing practices.

## About Children

This site is not intended for children under the age of 13. We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information via this site from visitors under the age of 13. We encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose to Web sites. Parents should not include their child’s full name anywhere on the website. Within SchoolFinder, secondary students above the age of 13 may write school reviews, however students' names will never be displayed for privacy reasons.

Education.com offers a premium service called Brainzy which is intended for use by children under 13. Parental registration is required for all children using Brainzy. During registration, Brainzy customers are asked to provide personal information about their children including participating children's names, genders and dates of birth. Children are never asked to provide personal information. Brainzy is an entirely ad-free environment and Education.com does not share information collected in Brainzy (either personal information gathered during registration or tracking information collected during use) with any 3rd party. Read complete Brainzy Privacy Policy below.

## Information We Collect and How We Use It

### Summary of Information We Gather and Track

We gather two types of data about users:

  1. personal information, which individual users provide (i) when registering as a member of our Websites via Education.com's internal registration form or using Facebook Connect, (ii) when registering as a subscriber to one of our partners’ premium subscription services, (iii) when using Worksheets, Activities, Workbooks, Collections, Blogs, JustAsk, SchoolFinder, MyEdu, or our Download All feature and any other community features on our site, (iv) when participating in surveys and polls,  (v) when participating in surveys or sweepstakes; (vi) when posting comments to Blogs; and (vii) when signing up to receive one or more of our free email newsletters and notifications; and
  2. tracking information, which is automatically collected about all visitors to the Websites.



### Personal Information

We collect personal information in several places on our Websites, which are set forth generally below. We will always provide a secure area of our Websites for you to enter your information.

#### **Membership**

Currently, visitors to our site are able to have access to some content without becoming a member. However, visitors who would like to download worksheets, gain access to the community features on our site, or rate editorial content on Education.com, are required to register to become a member. In order to register, visitors must supply us with a valid email address, a unique User Name and password, and some additional information about you (e.g., your "type": parent, teacher, or student; zip code, etc.).

#### **Facebook Connect**

Education.com offers Facebook users the opportunity to register with and share activity using Facebook Connect. By completing registration via Facebook Connect, you grant Education.com the permission to access your Facebook profile information and to use it in accordance with the Facebook terms of use and the Education.com Privacy Policy.

If you are not currently registered as an Education.com member and you use the Facebook Connect functions, you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then will be given the option to register and join Education.com. Once you register with Education.com and connect with Facebook, you will be given the opportunity to opt in to posting Education.com activity back to your Facebook wall.

#### **Premium Services**

If you’d like access to one or more of our paid offerings (Education.com Plus, Workbooks, Brainzy), you'll need to register for our site, and you'll be asked to provide additional personal, billing, or other specified information that we'll need to charge for and activate the service or product. Customers purchasing Brainzy (Education.com's online learning program) will be asked to provide personal information about their children including name, gender and date of birth. Children using Brainzy will never be asked to provide personal information.

#### **Blogs, JustAsk, SchoolFinder, MyEdu and Comments**

As a service to our users, we feature Blogs, JustAsk, SchoolFinder, MyEdu and Comments where users with similar interests can share information and support one another, send messages to one another, provide a review of a school, comment on editorial content, or where users can post questions for experts and other members of the community to answer. Information shared in Blogs, JustAsk, SchoolFinder, and Comments postings is accessible to the general public and may be viewed, disclosed to or collected by third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy or that may use the information to send you unsolicited communications. In addition, we may retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law. You should think carefully before disclosing any personal information in any public forum.

#### **Surveys/Polls**

At certain times, you may be asked to participate in surveys, which are generally aimed at obtaining general information, such as your reactions to a particular article or feature set on our site. Because information obtained in these surveys is connected with individual subscribers and is used internally to better market our services, participation is voluntary. In addition, some of our advertising partners will on occasion take polls of our visitors. Such polls are for use by the advertising partner, and participation is voluntary. We do not assure privacy of information voluntarily provided in response to a survey or poll.

#### **Contests and Sweepstakes**

We sometimes offer contests or sweepstakes in which certain personal information is required for registration, for purposes of verifying the entrants’ identities and notifying the winners. If the contest or sweepstakes is being administered by a third party, this information will be disclosed to that third party. However, entrants may select contest names distinct from their User Names, and the information is not connected with their User Names.

### Tracking Information

Tracking data consists of both individual and aggregated tracking information and is automatically gathered using “cookies.” A cookie is a small data file containing information, such as a user’s member name, that is written to the user’s hard drive by a web server and used to track the pages visited.

#### **Our Tracking**

We use cookies in several ways to track users’ navigation through our Websites. First, the information we gather on an individual basis is used for internal purposes only, such as accessing a Member Profile. We also use tracking information on an aggregate basis, to track the readership of stories and usage of our products, to analyze traffic patterns on the Websites, and to provide anonymous reporting of usage for internal and external clients. In all cases, our cookies are encoded and contain a unique digital signature to prevent tampering. They do not contain user passwords. We also employ technology that is commonly referred to as “action tags” (also known as “web beacons” or “one pixel .gif files”) to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements.

You can control your browser’s settings regarding cookies by selecting “Internet Options” or “Preferences” in the menu bar of your browser. This will allow you to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, have your browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether. However, because cookies allow you to easily navigate our Websites without having to constantly log in using your User Name and password, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

#### **Tracking by our contractors and agents**

We use third-party online business optimization software (including Omniture), to assist us in the capture and analysis of customer usage and tracking information. These service providers act as limited agents to us, for the purpose of providing their services. Any information obtained by such third parties from our users or us is and will remain our property, and will be subject to this privacy policy. We do not permit these service providers to review, share, distribute, print, or reference any session data of visitors to our Websites except as specified in our agreements with them or as may be required by law. To view the privacy policy of Omniture, [click here](http://www.omniture.com/privacy/policy). If you wish to opt out of Omniture’s information collection and analysis, follow the opt out instructions described in their privacy policy.

#### **Tracking by our Advertisers**

Our advertisers include a wide variety of companies, such as financial services companies (e.g., brokerage firms, banks, and mortgage companies), computer manufacturers, software companies, automobile makers, toy manufacturers, and retail stores. Our advertisers and advertising vendors display targeted advertisements. Although we do not provide any personal information to the advertiser or advertising vendor, by interacting with or clicking on an ad you consent to the possibility that the advertiser will assume you meet the criteria used to target the add.

In addition to cookies placed by us or our agents, as described above, advertisers and advertising vendors that serve ads onto our web sites may use their own cookies or other tracking technologies. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of any such advertisers and vendors.

We use an independent network advertising server (DoubleClick) that delivers advertising content to the pages that you view on our Websites. If you would like to know more about the privacy practices of one such third-party ad server, please [click here to view DoubleClick’s privacy policy](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/). If you wish to opt out of DoubleClick’s information collection and analysis, follow the [opt out](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/) instructions described in their privacy policy.

We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit [networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). 

## Use of the Information

You can select which free newsletters you would like to receive or remove yourself from our free newsletter delivery list at any time by visiting your [Newsletter Preferences page](https://web.archive.org/my/newsletters/).

#### **Special Offers and Advertisements**

## Security

We limit access to personal information about you to those employees whom we determine need access to that information to provide products or services to you.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post changes to this privacy policy.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it before disclosing personal information on one of our Websites. If we make changes that materially affect our uses or disclosures of personally identifiable information that we have previously collected from you, we will provide a mechanism for you to opt out of the new use or disclosure.

## Your Independent Relationship With Other Companies

Please note that this Privacy Policy will not apply to your independent relationships with other companies that from time to time may offer you products and services on the Websites. Those companies’ privacy policies will govern how they collect, use and disclose personal information that you provide to them.
