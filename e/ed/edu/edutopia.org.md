## How Do We Use Information?

**Subscription:**  
Our Web site's subscription form requires users to give us contact information, unique identifiers, and demographic information. All subscriber information is submitted to us on a voluntary basis. We may also ask subscribers to tell us how they found out about us. Once you subscribe, we use customer contact information from the subscription form to contact you, to send you information about our foundation, and/or to give you updates on products and/or services.

**Collecting and Sharing Data:**  
We collect information to find out how people found our Web site, which pages they visited, and how long they stayed. In addition, we may aggregate demographic and nonpersonal information you provide and use this information to better design our Web experience and to improve our marketing strategy. If you are thirteen or older, we may share this demographic and nonpersonal information with our advertisers, licensees, and/or other business partners with whom we link to permit them to contact you with information about certain products and services. If you are under thirteen, we will not share your personal information with third parties.

Other than as explained in this policy, we may disclose personal information in the good-faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes, respond to any claims, or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of The George Lucas Educational Foundation, its subsidiaries and affiliates, our customers, or the public. In addition, information about our customers, including without limitation personal information regarding customers under thirteen, may be disclosed as part of any bankruptcy, merger, sale, transfer of company assets, or acquisition.

**Mailing lists:**  
Where appropriate and if you are thirteen or older, the option to allow us to share certain information with some of our promotional partners may be provided, or the option for you to elect not to have us share certain information may be provided. If you are under thirteen, we will not share your personal information with third parties. You always have the right to unsubscribe from any mailing lists we may maintain. Parents, you can always ask us to review or delete any of your child's information and you can refuse to permit further collection and use of your child's information at any time by sending us a written request at the physical address or email address listed below. IF YOU ARE UNDER THIRTEEN, YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS ACTIVITY.

**Email and E-Newsletters:**  
We may offer fully interactive registered email services. Our newsletters may include links to independently operated Web site. Although we do not provide any personally identifiable information about kids under thirteen to any independently operated Web sites (that is, a Web site not owned, controlled, and operated by us), such Web Site(s) may solicit personally identifiable information from kids under thirteen. Please be aware that we don't control and are not responsible for their actions, privacy policy(ies), or terms of use. IF YOU ARE UNDER THIRTEEN, YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN EITHER OF THESE ACTIVITIES.

  


## Online Store:

CreateSpace E-Store hosts the ordering system and order data. CreateSpace will collect order information during the process of fulfilling an order and supporting the shopping experience. Please see the [CreateSpace Privacy Policy](http://www.createspace.com/Help/Rights/Privacy.jsp) for more information about how CreateSpace uses this information.

**Purchasing Items:**  
Purchasing items from the online store may require the giving of personally identifiable information (such as name and credit card information). IF YOU ARE UNDER THIRTEEN, YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS ACTIVITY.

**Security of Credit Card Information:**  
We have selected CreateSpace to provide us with its DVD on Demand service. All transactions within the CreateSpace online store are handled using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt sensitive information during transmission. CreateSpace uses commercially reasonable methods to secure personal information, such as storing your credit card information in an encrypted manner, using appropriate firewalls, and keeping certain servers inaccessible to outside networks.

CreateSpace reveals only the last four digits of customer credit cards, and only employees and agents have access to personal customer information when confirming an order and assisting customers. More information about the online store security is available [here](http://www.createspace.com/Help/Rights/Privacy.jsp).

**Use of Cookies:**  
A cookie is a small data file stored on the user's hard drive tyhat may contain information about the user. CreateSpace uses cookies to remember customer log-in information. This information is used to track the progress of your shopping session, and to maintain information about any interaction with a customer. GLEF also uses cookies to keep track of your preferences for the Video Gallery and to limit the number of times pop-ups occur for each user.

**IP Address and Machine Type:**  
An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from our Web site, our servers log your IP address. An IP address does not contain personally identifiable information. Except with respect to our e-commerce activities (for example, online purchases) and our e-newsletters, we do not link IP addresses with personally identifiable information. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. We may also collect information about your browser software and/or machine type (for example, Windows, Mac, and Unix).

**Links:**  
We do create links to the Web sites of other parties. The inherent nature of the Internet allows easy access from one Web site to another. Though we certainly try not to link to any Web sites that contain unsuitable or inappropriate material, we cannot control any of these links and are not responsible for any content appearing on Web sites linked to or from our Web site, or for any personal information gathered at those independently operated Web sites. Independently operated Web sites are not associated with or authorized by us and may also have links leading to this Web site. IF YOU ARE UNDER THIRTEEN, GET YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE LINKING TO OTHER WEB SITES.
