**Edudemic Magazine In-App Subscriptions**

Paid In App Subscriptions are non-refundable. In App Subscriptions will automatically renew for the applicable time period you have selected, and, where applicable, your Account will be charged no more than 24-hours prior to the expiration of the current In App Subscription. You may cancel automatic renewal of paid In App Subscriptions by selecting Manage App Subscriptions in your Account and selecting the subscription you want to modify. The auto-renew feature of the subscription will be turned off if the Application Provider increases the price of the subscription. You may cancel free In App Subscriptions by deleting the App Store Product from your device. Certain In App Subscriptions may be designated as “Newsstand” products, in which case they will appear only within the Newsstand application on your device after download. You should also review additional information about the paid In App Subscription offer at the point of sale within the App Store Product. Apple may ask for your permission to provide the name, email address and zip code listed in your Account to the Application Provider so that the Application Provider can send you marketing messages about its own products in accordance with its publicly posted privacy policy. Once the Application Provider has this information, it will be treated in accordance with the Application Provider’s privacy policy. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of the Application Provider before agreeing to give it your personal information.
