**Victorian Education Channel Privacy Statement**

**Victorian Education Channel Privacy Principles**

The Victorian Education Channel is committed to protecting your personal information. 

The Channel is a service provided by the Victorian Department of Education and Training (DE&T). DE&T has an [information privacy policy](http://www.det.vic.gov.au/det/resources/privacy.htm) and handles personal information in accordance with the Victorian Privacy laws: the Information Privacy Act 2000 and Health Records Act 2001. 

The Channel does not retrieve or record any personal information, except that which you provide freely as part of the 'Contact Us' forms for 'Site Suggestion' and 'General Comment'. Any personal information you provide will be treated as confidential and used only for the purposes provided, except in exceptional circumstances where authorised by law. Under the 'Contact Us' section of the site, you may choose to provide us with contact details. We use this information only to respond to the feedback you provide to us.

**Third party sites**

The Channel enables discovery of resources from third party sites. This privacy statement does not apply to the third party sites. When you link to another site, we recommend that you read the privacy statement of that site. 

**Use of Cookies**

Through our web monitoring service provider, the Channel uses cookies to provide information that assists us in making the site more useable. Cookies are small data files that we send to your computer so that we can record usage statistics about the Channel, such as the number of visits, unique visits, documents viewed, browser type, and the way the site is navigated.

While the **anonymous** statistical data we collect may be aggregated and used in broader statistical analysis by either the Channel or our web monitoring service provider to improve our services, at no time can we personally identify you as the source of that data.

If you have any queries about our privacy policy please contact the Channel Manager at [channel.manager@edumail.vic.gov.au](mailto:channel.manager@edumail.vic.gov.au).
