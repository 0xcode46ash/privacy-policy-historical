# EDUCAUSE Privacy Policy

EDUCAUSE Privacy Policy

EDUCAUSE ("we" in the following text) is committed to informing its membership and the general public about news, services, and professional development opportunities that pertain to the transformation of higher education through information technologies. We also strive to facilitate communication among colleagues in the higher education IT community. To these ends, we maintain a database of information about our constituents to enable us to communicate with them and to enable them to communicate with each other. 

Protecting privacy in a technically secure environment and giving individuals a measure of control over their personally identifiable information are critical elements in the EDUCAUSE communication strategy. Consequently, we have instituted the following set of information practices and rights: 

## Personal Information We Hold

  * name
  * job title and organization name
  * postal address
  * e-mail address
  * phone
  * personal URL
  * records of your involvement with EDUCAUSE and its affiliate organizations
  * photo
  * speaker/faculty biographical information
  * unified login information (user name/password)



## How We Collect Personal Information 

  * We retain demographic information that you volunteer through online and offline transactions and inquiries.
  * We occasionally obtain contact information for individuals associated with organizations with which we are collaborating on special projects.
  * When you visit the EDUCAUSE Web site, we collect information about site usage.
  * We track aggregate information about click-through responses to HTML e-mail messages.
  * We collect access and contribution information if you participate in a secured SharePoint Team Web site for a member committee, task force, or community of practice.

Note: We do not collect personal information submitted through subscribing to our online newsletters or becoming a member of an EDUCAUSE constituent or discussion group.

## How We Secure Personal Information

The personal information we collect is stored in a SQL Server database that is protected by multiple passwords. In addition, our online forms are secured with SSL encryption technology to ensure the safety of sensitive information transmitted through them (e.g., credit card information). 

Contact information for individuals in our database is available publicly through our [Membership Directory](https://web.archive.org/memdir/) to foster communication among colleagues. See the "Changing How We Use Your Information" section below if you would like to change your listing status. 

## How We Use the Personal Information We Hold

  * We use Web site usage and HTML message click-through data for anonymous, aggregate internal reporting to improve online services.
  * We use personal information to reply to communications you send us.
  * We use it to communicate essential information about transactions, such as an electronic receipt for a purchase or a confirmation of a conference registration.
  * If you are a designated representative of an EDUCAUSE member institution, we use it to send you announcements about news within the association and the profession.
  * We use it to inform you about EDUCAUSE events, programs, and services of potential interest, unless you have opted out of such communications.
  * We include your contact information and photo in the EDUCAUSE [Membership Directory](http://www.educause.edu/memdir/) unless you opt to be excluded.
  * We include your contact information in online and print registration lists for EDUCAUSE events for which you have registered, unless you opt to be excluded.
  * We share your name and postal mail addresses with corporate participants at EDUCAUSE conferences you have registered to attend, unless you have opted out of corporate participant communications.
  * For purposes approved by EDUCAUSE, we make available EDUCAUSE member representatives' names and postal mail addresses in printed or electronic form for one-time use only to other EDUCAUSE members.
  * We may provide you with a lead retrieval card at certain EDUCAUSE and affiliate conferences that contains your name and contact information. This card allows you to pass on your contact information to exhibitors from whom you would like to receive more information. If you allow a conference exhibitor to swipe that card, you give the exhibitor your name and contact information, including e-mail address.
