Weuse cookies to help manage the Web site to better serve visitors. A cookie is a piece of data that is either maintained only for the duration of a particular session visit or is stored on the user's computer to support future visits. EDUCAUSE uses both types of cookie.

## How Does EDUCAUSE Secure Your Personal Information?

The personal information we collect is stored in databases and files that are protected by passwords and firewalls. In addition, online forms used for financial transactions are secured with SSL encryption technology to ensure the safety of sensitive information transmitted through them (e.g., credit card information). When credit card information is stored, it is done so only in an encrypted format.

If your basic personal information is in our database, it may be publicly available in our online and print directories and event registration lists, with the aim of fostering communication among colleagues. See the How Can You Change How EDUCAUSE Uses Your Information section below if you would like to change your listing status. 

## How Does EDUCAUSE Use Your Personal Information?

In addition to facilitating basic communication with you, the information we hold helps us enhance your experiences on our Web site and the efficacy of our communications with you. For example, by holding your basic personal information, we can automatically fill out transactional forms with that data to save you time and effort.

  * We use personal information to reply to communications you send us.
  * We use it to communicate essential information about transactions, such as an electronic receipt for a purchase or a confirmation of a conference registration. 
  * If you are a designated representative of an EDUCAUSE member organization, we use it to send you announcements about news within the association and the profession. 
  * We use it to inform you about EDUCAUSE events, programs, and services of potential interest, unless you have opted out of such communications. 
  * We include your name, your organization's name and state, your contact information, and photo in the EDUCAUSE [member directory](https://web.archive.org/MembershipDirectory/672) and event registration lists unless you opt to exclude your contact information. If you choose to exclude that information, only your name, your title, and your organization's name and state may appear.
  * We share your name and postal mail address with corporate participants at EDUCAUSE conferences you have registered to attend, unless you have opted out of corporate participant communications.

  * We may provide you with a lead retrieval card at certain EDUCAUSE and affiliate conferences that contains your basic personal information. This card allows you to pass on this information to exhibitors from whom you would like to receive more information. By allowing a conference exhibitor to swipe that card, you give the exhibitor your name and contact information, including e-mail address. 
  * We use anonymous, aggregated data about Web site visitors' site usage and technical capabilities as well as about HTML message opening and click-through rates to improve online services and communications.
