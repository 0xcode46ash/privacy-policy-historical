Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 

The Information We Collect

There are three kinds of users identified by EditMe: Prospects, Account Holders, and Registered Users. Prospects are users who create an EditMe account but do not sign up. Prospects are also users who visit an EditMe site and signup for our mailing list, but do not sign up for an EditMe account. Account Holders are paying EditMe customers who maintain their own site using the EditMe service. Registered Users are users who register on any Account Holder's site hosted by EditMe.

Prospects, and mailing list recipients must provide their name and email address, as well as where they heard about EditMe. The recipients of this mailing list will never be shared or sold with any other pary. 

Account Holders must provide information sufficient to create an EditMe account and process a payment with PayPal, our online payment-processing provider. Customers should consider any information entered for payment or account creation purposes to be collected by EditMe. This includes standard contact and billing information.

Registered Users enter a user name, password, and email address for the purposes of accessing protected content and/or functionality on any of EditMe's customers' web sites hosted by EditMe. 

Finally, EditMe and all customers' web sites hosted by EditMe collect standard HTTP log data, including visitor's IP addresses, browser type and platform if available, and referrer information.

The Way We Use Information

EditMe uses account holder email addresses for the purposes of customer account and site management notifications, such as account overdue notifications, new feature alerts, and other important messages. All such notifications come from EditMe. The EditMe Service Agreement requires customers to provide a valid email address to EditMe for the purposes of these important announcements.

_At no time is any personal information about EditMe customers, including email addresses, shared with any outside entity other than PayPal, our online payment-processing provider. Please see PayPal's Privacy Agreement for more information._

Messages sent to this mailing list will be from EditMe only, and will include only information about the EditMe service. Every message sent to the email list will include a link to unsubscribe from the list.

Registered users' email addresses are used for forgotten password reminders as requested by the registered users. Future versions of EditMe will allow Account Holders to send email newsletters to registered users of their sites. This feature _does not_ disclose the email addresses of Registered Users to the Account Holder. Registered Users must opt-in to receive these messages, and can opt-out at any time.

EditMe will use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

EditMe may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. The EditMe mailing list is hosted by Microsoft BCentral.

How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information

Account Holders may view and modify their billing information in the Billing section of the Site Settings tool after logging in.

Registered Users may view and modify their account information using the User Preferences tool after logging in.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. 

How To Contact Us
