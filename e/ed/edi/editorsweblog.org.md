# WAN-IFRA - Privacy Policy

### 1\. Data protection

To promote confidence in using our internet products and services, WAN-IFRA wishes to explain what happens with personal data that is gathered there. The following explains what kind of information is collected and how that information is used.

### 2\. Collection of data

You can access most pages on the WAN-IFRA website without divulging any information about yourself. In cases where your name, address, or other personal details are required, the website will inform you of this in advance. We store personal data communicated to us in connection with registration for an event, requests for information, or acquiring products or services. However, you can rest assured that we will never sell your personal details to third parties or market this information in any other way without your explicit permission. Personal data collected from forms will be passed on to the responsible WAN-IFRA staff member or the association member concerned.

### 3\. Right to cancel

At your request, WAN-IFRA will refrain from using your personal data to contact you and/or delete it. Please submit any such request by e-mail to [customerservice@wan-ifra.org](mailto:customerservice@wan-ifra.org). Data that is essential for order processing or other commercial purposes will not be deleted. Please be advised that, if you cancel, you cannot use our personalised service, as this is linked to your customer data.

### 4\. Cookies

WAN-IFRA, and, on our behalf, Nedstat use cookies to generating statistics on the numbers of new visitors and returning visitors. If you would like us not to use cookies, please turn off cookies in your browser. If you accept our cookies, please note that they will remain in your computer for five years unless you delete them.

### 5\. e-Mail newsletters

All that we require for your registration to our e-mail Newsletters "WAN-IFRA News" and "WAN-IFRA Executive News Service" is your e-mail address and (for "WAN-IFRA News") name, which we store and use to send you regular information via e-mail. As described already under item 2, we do not pass on any personal data to third parties. At the end of each newsletter there is a link that you can use at any time to cancel your subscription to our newsletters. Additionally, with a view toward further improving the newsletter offerings, we statistically analyse user and click behaviour in relation to our monthly "WAN-IFRA News".

### 6\. Minors

Persons under the age of 18 years should not communicate personal data to us without the prior consent of adults authorised to act on their behalf. We do not request, collect, or turn over personal data from minors to third parties.

### 7\. Links to other websites

The WAN-IFRA web pages contain links to other websites. WAN-IFRA has no influence on the content of outside web pages, nor on the adherence or non-adherence of these websites to data protection regulations.
