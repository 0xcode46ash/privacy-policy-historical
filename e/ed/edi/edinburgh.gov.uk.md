# Your privacy - City of Edinburgh Council

## Our aims 

The Council takes your privacy seriously. We always aim to follow the guidance provided by the [Information Commissioner](http://www.ico.gov.uk/ "The Information Commissioner"), and to comply with the [Data Protection Act](http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/706/data_protection/389/data_protection_act_1998 "The Data Protection Act 1998 as it applies to the Council"). 

## Your data and this web site 

You can submit (potentially) personal or sensitive data to us in the following pages of the web site: 

  * **Report it** , **Request it** and **Pay it** online forms 
  * other online forms ( **Register** for an account) 
  * when **Signing in** to Your Account. 



The web site does store [cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie "The Wikipedia definition for cookies") on your computer, but these do not contain personal data or anything that could identify you to others.   
Our site cookies include:

  * [Google Analytics](http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/concepts/gaConceptsCookies.html "Google Analytics use of cookies") \- this is used to provide us with information on our site usage  

  * [Jadu content management system](http://support.jadu.net/info/20006/guides_and_resources/36/eu_cookie_directive_information "Jadu content system and cookies") \- these cookies are to allow our site to operate properly for visitors

WorldPay is a leading internet payment provider and is part of the Royal Bank of Scotland group.

## How your data gets to us 

The pages listed above have **[SSL encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security "The Wikipedia definition for SSL")**. Your browser will confirm this by showing a closed padlock icon (or similar) in its toolbar or status bar. Encryption effectively prevents your data being intercepted when you submit it to this web site's servers. Authorised Council staff will also retrieve the data using SSL encryption. 

## What we do with your data 

When you're filling in our online forms, we'll use blue text alongside questions to tell you how we intend to use the data we're asking for (this is called a **[Privacy Notice](http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/topic_specific_guides/privacy_notices.aspx "Guidance on Privacy Notices from the Information Commissioner")** ). This guidance is provided wherever the data: 

  * may be used to identify you 
  * is of a particularly sensitive nature. 



We may not provide this guidance where you would reasonably expect us to need the data in order to deliver the service you're requesting. 

Your data will be stored securely within various enterprise systems, most of them hosted on the Council's corporate network. 

In line with our [Records policy](http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/704/access_to_information/390/records_policy "The Councils Records policy"), we aim to archive or delete data from our systems when it's no longer actively useful for providing the relevant service to you.
