We put a high priority on protecting your privacy.

We will not share your email address with anyone, and you can choose to stop hearing from us at any time — [just ask](https://web.archive.org/contact).

## All the details

When you register for special services on one of our sites, you give us personal information about yourself (such as name, address, zip code, email address, etc.). You can always [opt out](https://web.archive.org/about/this-site/privacy#optout), now or at any time later, to keep from getting any unwanted messages or solicitations.

If you have any questions, [please ask](https://web.archive.org/contact).

### **1\. What personally identifiable information of yours is collected?**

This means information that tells us something about who you are, such as your name, phone number, email address, mailing address, or even credit card number (if you use a credit card to make a donation).

If you visit our sites to read or download information, such as consumer brochures or press releases, we collect and store only the following non-personally identifying information about you: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton University’s domain); the date and time you access our site; which pages you visit; and the Internet address of the web site from which you may have linked directly to our site.

If you ask for one of our many personalized or enhanced services, we will ask you to provide us with personally identifiable information. For example, if you wish to contact your representative in Congress, we will ask for your address so that we can direct your communication to the correct member of Congress. We also keep a record of faxes and e-mails you send from our system, as well as your comments.

We want to be very clear: we only obtain this kind of personally-identifying information when you choose to provide it.

### **2\. What organization is collecting your information?**

### **3\. How your information may be used**

We use your personal information to give you personalized service (for example, information about your neighborhood, or your favorite subjects); to send you email alerts; to answer your requests; to let you become a member online, etc. You can [opt out](https://web.archive.org/about/this-site/privacy#optout) at any time to stop any further contact from us.

We also use it to track use of our web sites; this lets us see which of our features are the most popular so we can better serve our users’ needs. This also lets us provide aggregate data about our traffic (not identifying you personally, but showing how many visitors used which features, for example) to outside parties. Also see, “How ‘cookies’ are used.”

We may also use this information to suggest other web site services to you, ask you to become a member of EDF, or to solicit donations. At any time you can [opt out](https://web.archive.org/about/this-site/privacy#optout), so that we will not contact you by email, mail, fax, or telephone.

We may share your personally-identifiable information, as well as a record of transactions you conduct with us, with a third-party advertising partner and its service providers in order to deliver you advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain websites. Our advertising partner will make the data we provide it anonymous. To learn more about the use of this information or to make choices about receiving personalized advertising on other sites, please visit the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices).

### **5\. What kind of security procedures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?**

We store your personally identifiable information on secure servers. We also use other “anti-hacking” security measures and employ security consultants. We use a secure server to process all credit card donations and updates to monthly billing.

### **7\. How “cookies” are used**

Some of our web sites use “cookie” data to provide better services. They remind us who you are and how you like to use our web site, based on what you’ve done and told us before. The cookie is stored in your browser and is read when you come back to our web site. Cookies let us take you to the information and features you’re particularly interested in. They also let us track your and others’ usage across devices, so we know which parts of our sites are most popular. You can reject cookies or delete them.

We have implemented Google Analytics features based on display advertising (remarketing and reporting on impressions, demographics and interests). Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using Google’s [Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/settings/ads), a [browser extension](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) or via the [NAI’s consumer opt-out](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

We, along with third-party vendors, including Google, use first- and third-party cookies together to report how your ad impressions and other uses of ad services are related to visits to our site. For more details about Google’s privacy practices, please see [Google’s privacy center](http://www.google.com/privacy.html).
