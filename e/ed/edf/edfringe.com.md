# edfringe.com : official site of the edinburgh festival fringe

The Edinburgh Festival Fringe website is maintained by the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, 180 High Street, Edinburgh, EH1 1QS. You can e-mail us at [admin@edfringe.com](mailto:admin@edfringe.com)

edfringe.com is absolutely committed to protecting your privacy. Put simply, we will not share your information with others without your prior consent. 

**What information do we collect when a user registers?**  
We collect some basic information from all of our registered users. This includes your name, e-mail address, postcode and age. We also ask some further, voluntary questions so we can get to know our users better and tailor our site and services to suit. If you do not wish to register, however, you can still access most of the site. 

**Will edfringe.com disclose the information it collects in this way to outside parties?**  
edfringe.com will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others unless you have given us your permission. With your permission we will only share the information with carefully chosen, reputable and trustworthy third parties. edfringe.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

**What other information does edfringe.com collect?**  
We get further information from you when you buy an item in the Fringe shop or a ticket at the on-line Fringe box office. In both cases, we need to collect this information from you to either process a transaction or fulfil your order. This information may include, but is not limited to, details such as your name, address and payment details. 

**What happens when I opt-in to the Fringe mailing list?**  
By subscribing for Fringe updates, you give us your consent to receive from us (but only us) e-mails detailing special offers, announcements and competitions. You can unsubscribe from this service easily, and at any time, by either using the link provided at the bottom of the e-mail you are sent, or by logging into the site, going to the 'myfringe' area and updating your details.
