We collect IP addresses. Your IP address is used to gather broad and specific demographic information as well as for validation purposes. In addition, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website.  
  
Cookies  
A "cookie" is a small text file that a website can place on your computer's hard drive in order to collect information about your activities on the website. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you have the option to change your browser to decline them.

Web Site Tracking Software   
Web servers, or those of third-party vendors, utilize certain tracking software to capture your domain name address (the address of your Internet service provider) for purposes of tracking Website statistics. The capture of your domain name is a common practice among websites for measuring the number of hits, pages visited, and length of user session. We use this information to measure the effectiveness of the Website offerings in order to service you better.

Policies for Each Category of User  


**_Former Embark Users_**  
All of the information you provided to us while we were a part of The Princeton Review is governed by The Princeton Review privacy policy that was in effect at the time you provided information about yourself to Embark. As of June 20, 2005, The Princeton Review privacy policy provided that: "We don't share the information you have given us without your permission to do so." What does this mean - Embark will not share any of the information you provided to us while we were a part of The Princeton Review unless you want us to. This applies to all the information you provided to Embark while it was a part of The Princeton Review.

 _Important Notice:_ If you use our Website after February 17, 2007 and give us information about yourself (whether it's new information or the same information you previously gave us), this new giving of information will be governed by the policies applicable to a **_Current User._**

**_Former Embark School Application Users_**  
The information you provided to us on a college application hosted by Embark while we were a part of The Princeton Review was not covered by The Princeton Review privacy policy. Further, Embark did not have its own privacy policy. Since there is no privacy policy that applies to this information, it will be governed by the policies applicable to a **_Current User._**

**_All Other Former Embark Users_**  
The information you provided to us was not covered by a privacy policy because Embark did not have a privacy policy. Since there is no privacy policy that applies to this information, it will be governed by the policies applicable to a **_Current User._**

**_Current School Application Users_**  
The information you provide to us through the Apply Online Program will be governed by the Embark Application Privacy Policy, which is described in the Embark hosted online college application. If you do not remember the details of that privacy policy, you may click on this link to find out what it said.

If you are a **_Current School Application User_** and asked Embark to store your data in the Embark.com profile, you are also a **_Current User_** and the **_Current User's_** policies will also apply to you.

**_Current Users_**
