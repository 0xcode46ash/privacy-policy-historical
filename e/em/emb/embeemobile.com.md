# Embee Mobile - EmbeePay: Terms and Conditions

### Introduction and Scope

In this Terms and Conditions, we (Embee Mobile, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, California) describe how we use personally identifiable information about you that we collect through our EmbeePay application and other web properties that are developed and maintained by the Company. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other data, including, without limitation, data that we collect offline or data that others collect on websites that are linked to the Sites.

### Types of Data Collected; Collection Methods; Combination of Data

You actively send information to us when you sign up with us a member on a Site, participate in surveys or promotions, post opinions on our bulletin boards, respond to us or otherwise contact us. Depending on your choices, you may send us personally identifiable information such as your email address, name, mailing address, phone number, birthday, and gender; password. But, you can also use certain features of our Sites without telling us your name and if you do not tell us who you are, we do not try to find out.

We also track information about how our Site is used by you through cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). For example, your Internet browser automatically transmits to us information such as the URL of the website you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using.

To accomplish some of the foregoing data processing, we utilize independent contractors.

In addition, we participate in ad networks. The ad networks that we participate in collect anonymous information using cookies to target some of the advertising you see on the Sites and on other third party websites.

You can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse or delete cookies altogether, but certain features of the Sites might not work without certain cookies.

If you have actively sent us your name or other personally identifiable information, we may combine such information with tracked information for the purposes set forth below.

### Purposes of Data Collection

We collect information about you because we want to determine what you may like or find interesting, so we can provide you with targeted information and advertising (on our Site, in newsletters, via email and otherwise). In addition, we use data to create statistics and reports where personally identifiable information has been removed and aggregated (such that it is anonymous as regards any specific user) for various business purposes.

### Disclosure of Data

We keep your personally identifiable information confidential and we generally do not disclose it. But, please note the following clarifications and exceptions:  


  * Our employees and independent contractors have access to some of your personally identifiable information for the purpose of helping us run our business (and not for their own purposes). They access and use such data subject to our instructions, on a "need to know" basis and under confidentiality and security obligations.
  * If we ever sell a Site or substantial parts of our business, we may disclose your personally identifiable information to a (prospective) buyer on the condition that such buyer agrees to comply with this Privacy Policy.
  * We may also share your personally identifiable information to respond to law enforcement requests, court orders or other legal process or if we believe that such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent or respond to illegal activities, fraud, and physical threats to you or others or as otherwise required by any applicable law or regulation.
  * Even though we do not provide any personally identifiable information about you specifically to any advertising customers, they can occasionally find out information indirectly. For example, we frequently agree on target audiences for particular ads (for example, an advertiser may ask us to send certain information on mobile users in a given city who have a particular type of mobile phone, who may be particularly interested). If you choose to respond to such targeted advertisements, the advertiser may deduce that you are a member of the target audience to whom we sent the ad.
  * If you sign up for our services on a third party website, such third party may know - from you - that you signed up on one or our Sites.
  * Before we disclose your personally identifiable data to a third party for their own business purposes (such as a survey or a sweepstake), we will first obtain your consent, for example via email, click-through, an online opportunity to opt-out or otherwise.
  * We may share personally identifiable information with affiliated companies.
  * We freely use and disclose data in anonymous form, for example, in statistics or reports to our advertising customers. Please remember that if you post any information in areas of our Sites that are generally accessible to users, such as chat rooms and message boards, it will be available to the public.



### Security

We take reasonable steps to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. But, you should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free. In particular, email sent to or from the Sites may not be secure.

### Access and Correction; Comments and Questions

Please keep your personally identifiable information, accurate, current, and complete by routinely updating your user profile. If you have any questions, comments or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at Embee Mobile, Inc., ATTN: Embee Community, 580 Market Street, Suite 250, San Francisco, CA 94104.

### Opt-Out, Communication Preferences

You may modify your communication preferences and/or opt-out from specific communications at any time. Please specify and adjust your preferences within the EmbeePay application.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy was last updated on April 4, 2012. We reserve the right to amend it from time to time and if we change it materially, we will post a revised version on the Sites. Please check back periodically, and especially before you provide any personally identifiable information to us.
