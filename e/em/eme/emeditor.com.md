## Emurasoft Privacy Policy Notice

All Emurasoft, Inc. products and services are governed by our privacy policy, which explains how we treat personal information.

Our Commitment to Privacy: Emurasoft’s privacy policy covers the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that may be collected by Emurasoft. Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, and how we safeguard your personal information. Your privacy is a priority at Emurasoft, and we go to great lengths to protect it. We never share your information with anyone else, for any reason.

The Information We Collect: This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Emurasoft websites. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to access the forums. “Personal information” is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or billing information. The types of personal information collected at these pages are: name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information. On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient’s address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are: name, address, email address, and phone number.

The Way We Use Information: We use the information you provide about yourself or others when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not stored or shared with outside parties. You can register with our website if you would like to access the forums. Information you submit on the forum registration pages is used only for the purpose of using the forums, unless you specify otherwise. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the purposes described when the information is provided, unless you specify otherwise.

Emurasoft’s default option is to opt-in, meaning that Emurasoft will never send you newsletters or any other marketing emails unless you initiate the process to receive those emails. For example, you will not receive newsletters just because you have purchased products from us. You will only receive newsletters if you sign up for them on the newsletters registration page.

Our Commitment to Data Security: To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Cookies and Other Technology: When you visit our website, we may send one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser, however cookies do not identify any individual user. As is true of many websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and Internet Service Provider (ISP).

Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy: Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. Our sites are not aimed to attract children and their objectives are not to collect personal information from children. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our websites from those we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

How You Can Access, Correct, or Update Your Information: You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by contacting us at [info@emurasoft.com](mailto:info@emurasoft.com) and requesting the information. You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.

Users’ Choices: We offer you choices when we ask for personal information, whenever reasonably possible. You may decline to provide personal information to us and/or refuse cookies in your browser, although some of our features or services may not function properly as a result. We make good faith efforts to provide you access to your personal information upon request and to let you correct such data if it is inaccurate and delete it, when reasonably possible.

Changes to the Privacy Policy: Emurasoft may update and amend this privacy statement from time-to-time. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a prominent notice on our site and by updating the “Last Modified Date” at the bottom of this privacy statement.

How to Contact Us: Should you have any questions or concerns about these privacy policies, or if you feel your privacy inquiry or request has not been addressed to your satisfaction, please send us an email at [info@emurasoft.com](mailto:info@emurasoft.com). Thank you.
