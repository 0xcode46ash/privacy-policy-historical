This Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information that EMEDIAVITALS.COM collects when you use any of our Sites or Services. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that VITAL BUSINESS MEDIA does not own or control or to people that VITAL BUSINESS MEDIA does not employ or manage.

2\. What We Collect

We may collect and store any personally identifiable information you provide to us. Personally identifiable information is data that identifies you, or that can be combined with other information to identify or contact you, and includes (but is not limited to) your name, business or personal physical or email address, and telephone number. 

You are not obligated to provide us with any personally identifiable information, although registration is required to access the full range of information and Services offered. EMEDIAVITALS.COM enables users (“Members”) to create EMEDIAVITALS.COM profiles, which allow them to control their profile information and whether it should be made public or private. This also allows members to identify themselves with their contributions to any EMEDIAVITALS.COM Site and to manage their EMEDIAVITALS.COM e-mail-based subscriptions. We strive to limit the type of personally identifiable information that we collect to information that helps us accomplish our goal of providing superior services for the benefit of our existing and prospective Members.
