**Our pledge to you, our customer**  
Cooking.com respects your privacy. Our Internet site is meant to be a service to you. In order to provide you with the best products, timely information and quality customer service, we record a variety of information from your visit to our site. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

**Your personal information: what we collect and how we use it**

*  **When you purchase products from a Cooking.com company** , we collect your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information. First, we use this information to fulfill your order and to communicate with you about your order. In fulfilling your order, we share your personal information with outside parties to the extent necessary to fulfill your order. In addition,

**a. Your First Purchase from a Cooking.com company** \- We use the information you provide to: 

  * **automatically place you on our e-mail list** to receive special offers and updates about products and services, unless you edit your subscription profile at the time your order is placed;
  * **automatically place you on our direct mail/catalog list** to receive from us direct mail and printed catalogs with special offers and updates about products and services; and
  * **make lists of our customers' names and postal addresses (but not e-mail addresses or phone numbers) available** to pre-screened companies who have specific direct mail (e.g. catalog) product or service offers that we think may be of interest to you.

**b. Your Subsequent Purchases from a Cooking.com company** \- If you have purchased a product from a Cooking.com company before, unless you edit your subscription profile at the time your order is confirmed, your subscription status will remain unchanged.

Whether you are making a first purchase or any subsequent purchase, if you later decide that you want to be removed from a list or do not want us to share your name and postal address information, simply follow the instructions in the section "Reviewing, Changing Your Information or Unsubscribing" below.

*  **When you send a gift** and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's name and postal address. We use this information only to ship the product and confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to fulfill that order. Information you provide us to create a gift-card is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving the gift.

We use your guests' name and e-mail address only to send them the notification e-mail.

When you create a registry, guests can see your names, wedding date (month and year), wedding location (city and state), the items you have registered for, and the quantities you have received. If you password-protect the guest view of your registry, guests initially see only your names, wedding date and location. They need a password (provided to them by you) to view the items you have registered for.

*  **If you are part of a rewards or incentive program** such as American Airline's AAdvantage Program that gives you "points" or other incentives for purchasing product on our website, we will share your information with the operator of the rewards or incentive program in order to enable them to credit you with the purchase.

We only share with these pre-screened companies the individual names and postal address of customers who have actually purchased products from us (as opposed to those individuals who have provided information to us as part of some other registration or sign-up process).
