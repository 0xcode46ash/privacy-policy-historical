To the extent it is permitted by applicable laws, Emarsys eMarketing Systems AG (in the following referred to as “emarsys” or “we”) tracks and gathers certain information on this website that helps us to better understand our visitors’ needs related to our website and our services. We will never share this information with third parties unless explicitly stated in this policy or ordered by a court of law.

**Request Of Information  
**On some pages of our website users have the option to register for various emarsys services – e.g. newsletter, download of whitepapers, etc. – using data capture forms. These forms usually require the user’s name, email address, company, as well as other information that is necessary to provide the requested service. The user may choose to provide additional non-mandatory information that enables us to provide a more personalized service. To the extent it is permitted by applicable laws, we may also directly contact website users on the basis of the information they have provided in order to promote emarsys’ products. In case of requests form countries in which are not handled by Emarsys itself but by affiliated companies or other representatives, we may also transfer the data to the responsible affiliated company or representative for said purpose (in each case only to the extent it is permitted by applicable laws). The users can object to the use of their data as described above at any time.

Such data may include contact information (e.g. name, email, phone number), demographic information (e.g. zip code, date of birth) or others. The data will be used to provide the visitor with the service requested. Data gathered via surveys will be used for improving our website and services.
