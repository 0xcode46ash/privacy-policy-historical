**What Is a Cookie and Why Do We Use Them?**

A “cookie” is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store in a Web browser so that it can later be read back from that browser. The eMA uses cookies to store some personal preferences for your future visits. Cookies allow the eMA to recognize you more quickly; therefore, your time spent on our site is more personalized and productive. You’ll find that cookies are an industry standard and are used at most major Web sites in much the same way we use them here at the eMA. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the eMA site functionality.

We use in-house and one or more third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site, as well as when we serve the eMA buttons, banners, badges, videos or other content on member sites or other third-party websites. In the course of serving advertisements, we or our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser. While the cookie we set may be tied to your specific personal information we also may set anonymous cookies and all third party cookie data is anonymous. The eMA uses the anonymous information it collects to customize the advertisements that consumers see on participating web sites and to analyze if the advertising resulted in sales, clicks or other activity. In accordance with applicable laws and regulations, the eMA will also disclose this information in response to subpoenas, court orders and other required legal processes.

The eMA and/or these companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to the eMA and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that might be of interest to you.

In order to make the eMA a more valuable product for our subscribers and visitors, we also collect and analyze statistical information.

This information is distributed only to help attract appropriate advertisers for the the eMA site.
