**Privacy Is Primary**

At eMarketer, we take the issue of privacy seriously. Online -- and off -- all people want to do business in a safe, secure environment. It is our job -- yours and ours -- to create that sense of security. 

eMarketer allows visitors to provide as much -- or as little -- personal information as they wish. At eMarketer you:   


> * Decide what personally identifiable information to give us  
> 
> * Are given an unconditional guarantee of privacy from us

eMarketer gathers information about our customers in order to offer compelling and easily accessible online content while providing personal privacy protection:
