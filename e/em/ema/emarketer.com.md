# eMarketers Privacy Policy Statement

**Privacy Is Primary** At eMarketer, we take the issue of privacy seriously, and believe everyone involved in e-commerce should do likewise. Consumers' distrust -- and their fears -- of how online businesses use and disseminate personal information slows the development and growth of sales online. 

Online -- and off -- all customers wish to shop and do business in a safe, secure environment. It is our job -- yours and ours -- to create that sense of trust and well-being online. 

This Privacy Statement verifies that eMarketer has submitted its information policies and privacy practices to the TRUSTe program. While awaiting verification and membership (at which time we will display the TRUSTe seal), we are endeavoring to comply fully with TRUSTe privacy principles. 

TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit initiative whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of disclosure and informed consent. Because eMarketer has a commitment to privacy, our site has agreed to fully disclose its information practices to TRUSTe and have them reviewed and audited for compliance. When you visit a website displaying the TRUSTe mark, you can expect to be notified of: 

> * What information is gathered about visitors. 
> * What is done with the information. 
> * Exactly who the information is shared with. 

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [eMarketer's Publisher.](mailto:salfstad@emarketer.com) To return to eMarketer, please use the "Back" button on your browser. 

It is eMarketer's policy to allow visitors to provide as much -- or as little -- personal information they wish. As a reader or customer of eMarketer you: 

> * Decide what personally identifiable information we collect. 
> * Are given an unconditional guarantee of privacy. 

The information provided in this Privacy Policy Statement covers your interactions on the eMarketer Network at emarketer.com, estats.com, e-land.com, and any other site registered to us. 

eMarketer gathers information about our customers in order to offer compelling and easily accessible online content in a manner consistent with providing personal privacy protection: 

> * eMarketer sells information products online, and on those occasions we require extensive personal and financial information, but it is gathered on a secure site and never shared with anyone under any conditions. 
> * We catalog traffic patterns throughout the site. 
> * We develop summary -- not individual -- reports for our advertisers. An example of a summary report might be "12,000 people clicked on advertisement X today and they were in the eStats section of the site." The people that help make it possible for you to use eMarketer for free -- our advertisers -- use this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are. 

The eMarketer site contains links to other websites. eMarketer is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites. 

Other companies which place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising or content. eMarketer has no control over this collection of information (nor do we benefit from it). You should contact specific advertisers or content providers directly if you have any questions about their use of this information. We encourage our co-branding partners -- and all webmarketers -- to adopt privacy policies similar to this one and to become licensees of TRUSTe. 

There is a technology called "cookies" which can be used to provide tailored information from a website. A cookie is an element of data that a site sends to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer. Some eMarketer pages use cookies so that we can better serve you when you return to our site. However, you can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. For more information, see ["How To Work With Cookies."](http://home.netscape.com/products/security/resources/faq/cookies.html)

eMarketer puts control over communications directed to you where it belongs: In _your_ hands: 

> * We send e-mail newsletters only to users who ask to receive them. 
> * Once you are on the list -- you can easily get off. Each e-mail newsletter you receive has your address stamped on it, along with simple instructions on how to immediately unsubscribe that address from our newsletter list. 
> * We will never make your name or address available to any other companies or agencies.

If you have any questions or comments about our privacy practices, please contact [eMarketer's Publisher.](mailto:salfstad@emarketer.com) We can also be reached at:
