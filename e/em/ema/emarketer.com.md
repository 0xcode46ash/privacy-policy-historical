# Privacy Policy

Information Gathered  
eMarketer gathers information about its users in order to offer useful and easily accessible online content while providing privacy protection. 

1\. Web site Visitors and Newsletter Subscribers:   
eMarketer catalogs traffic patterns throughout the site through non-invasive click-through tracking. eMarketer develops summary \-- not individual -- reports for our advertisers. For example, we will report that "12,000 people clicked on advertisement X today and they were in the eStats section of the site." 

2\. Product Purchasers:  
eMarketer sells information products online. At the time of purchase, we require personal, business and financial information, such as name, e-mail address, shipping/billing address, telephone number and credit card number. This information is necessary to process the order and to send the product to the buyer. If you are a repeat customer, you may be asked to update this information. This information is transmitted in 128 bit encryption and we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order. 

Only our order processing/customer service staff has access to your information. We do not store or access credit card information from our Web server after your order is processed. eMarketer allows product purchasers to control the storage of their general contact information. If you would like to access, correct or delete any of your contact information that we have on file, please send an e-mail to [sales@emarketer.com](mailto:sales@emarketer.com).
