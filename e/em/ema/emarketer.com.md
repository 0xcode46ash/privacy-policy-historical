# Privacy Policy

  


eMarketer takes the issue of privacy seriously. We let the user decide what information to give us, and explain exactly what is done with it. eMarketer will never sell, distribute, barter or transfer any personally-identifiable information obtained from a user to a third party.   


## Information Gathered

eMarketer gathers information about its users in order to offer useful and easily accessible online content while providing privacy protection.

  1. **Website Visitors and Newsletter Subscribers:**

eMarketer catalogs traffic patterns throughout the site through non-invasive click-through tracking. eMarketer develops summary -- not individual -- reports for our advertisers. For example, we will report that "12,000 people clicked on advertisement X today and they were in the eStats section of the site." 

  2. **Product Purchasers:**

eMarketer sells information products online. At the time of purchase, we require personal, business and financial information, such as name, email, shipping/billing address and credit card number. If you are a repeat customer, you may be asked to update this information. This information is transmitted in 128 bit encryption and we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order. Only our order processing/customer service staff has access to your information. We do not store or access credit card information from our server after your order is processed. 




## Business Relationships

eMarketer's website links to other websites. eMarketer is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites. Advertisers on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising or content. eMarketer has no control over this data collection. You should contact specific advertisers or content providers directly if you have any questions about their privacy policies.   


## Cookies 

Some parts of the eMarketer site use "cookies." A cookie is an element of data that a website sends to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer. The cookies that eMarketer uses do not link to any of the user's personally-identifiable information. 

If you do not want cookies sent to your computer, you can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. Then you decide whether or not to accept it. If you reject cookies from eMarketer, you will not be able to enter some areas of the site. For more information, see ["How To Work With Cookies."](http://home.netscape.com/products/security/resources/faq/cookies.html)   


## Opt-In, Opt-Out Features

eMarketer puts control over e-mail communications in the users' hands:

> * We provide free e-mail newsletters to those who sign up for them. Newsletter subscribers can easily opt-out at any time.   
> 
> * Each newsletter has your e-mail address stamped on it with simple instructions on how to unsubscribe that address from our newsletter list.
