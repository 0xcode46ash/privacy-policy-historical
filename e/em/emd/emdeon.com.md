# Emdeon Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Emdeon Business Services, LLC website (this "Site"). This Statement discloses the Privacy Policy (this "Policy") for this Site and describes how Emdeon Business Services LLC ("Emdeon"), the operator of this Site, collects, protects and uses information we receive from visitors to this Site. This Policy has been created in order to demonstrate and inform you of our firm commitment to privacy and to outline how we deal with any personal data you provide while visiting this Site. If you do not agree with any portion of this Policy, you should not use this Site. This Policy applies only to information collected through this Site and not to information collected offline or through any other websites (even if affiliated with Emdeon or linked to by this Site).

**1\. The Information We Collect**

There are two kinds of information websites can obtain about you: 

**(A) Anonymous Information**

"Anonymous Information" is data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. Anonymous Information is aggregate data that websites use to administer their sites. This Anonymous Information comprises information that cannot be used to identify or contact you, and may include such information as your browser type or your Internet Protocol (IP) address (if not deleted, clipped or anonymized). Emdeon may from time to time retain third parties to help us collect and aggregate Site information.

**IP Addresses**

An IP address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our Site, avoid hacking attacks on the Site's servers, and may use it to gather broad demographic information. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information, even if such information is voluntarily provided by a user.

**Cookie Information**

As is the case with many websites, our Site uses a technology called "cookies", which are small data files that are downloaded onto your computer. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet, and allows us to tailor your visits to our Site to your individual preferences. We also may contract with third party service providers who assign cookies and/or web beacons to conduct site tracking for us. These companies use cookies solely to provide us with aggregate data about Site traffic. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser to prevent cookies or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access most of the features on our Site.

**(B) Personally Identifiable Information**

"Personally Identifiable Information" is any information that personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or your telephone number. For example, you may be asked to provide the following information:

**Email Correspondence**

Scattered throughout the Site are links or forms that can be used to contact this Site so you can comment, make a complaint, make suggestions and ask questions. Your name, organization, title, email address, address, and phone number are required on these forms. Emdeon may put information from email on file, but does not currently share, sell, license or transmit this information with third parties without express authorization from you.

**eNewsletters and Other Communications**

We offer access to various services through the Site, including the ability to submit and receive electronic payments and remittances through Emdeon's ePayment service (the "ePayment Service"). In order to enroll for the ePayment Service, your name, organization, email address, address, phone number, bank account owner, bank account type, bank account routing number and bank account number are required on the enrollment forms. This information is used for set-up of your ePayment Service account and to process payments through the ePayment Service. In addition, we collect information that we receive from you about your electronic transactions using the ePayment Service. Such information includes, without limitation, your payment and/or remittance data and history, and information regarding your requests and authorizations for payments to or from, as applicable, third parties. In addition, we collect information from third parties who have requested or otherwise authorized payments to or from you through the ePayment Service. In the event an issue arises in connection with your enrollment in or use of the ePayment Service, or a payment or remittance, we may also use this information to contact you regarding the same. To protect access to your account, we will also ask you to verify your identity in the event you contact us for assistance with your account. This information will only be used to verify critical information about you, including your contact information, in relation to your ePayment Service account.

**2\. How We Use Gathered Information**

The information you share with us may be used in a few ways:

**(A) Anonymous Information**

Anonymous Information is used internally for Site administration, troubleshooting, and to help improve the quality of this Site and its design. We may share such aggregated, non-personally identifiable information, such as demographics, with existing and prospective business partners and advertisers.

**(B) Personally Identifiable Information:**

Personally Identifiable Information collected by Emdeon may be used for purposes including administration of the Site, forum registration, enrollment in and administration of services offered by Emdeon and its third-party providers (including without limitation the ePayment Service), and communications with you. We share Personally Identifiable Information you provide in enrollment forms or otherwise provide in connection with enrollment in and/or services offered through the Site, including without limitation Emdeon's ePayment Service, with our third-party service providers as necessary to provide such services to you. In all cases, however, we will only use your information as permitted by law. We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property; (c) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site; or (d) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.

**3\. Opt-Out**

We support the right of visitors to choose. You will be given the right to opt-out of receiving any promotional materials about Emdeon or its partners whenever you are asked to provide Personally Identifiable Information on this Site. If you do not opt-out at that time, but later decide that you do not wish to receive future communications of this nature you can contact us at [brandcentral@emdeon.com](mailto:brandcentral@emdeon.com) or at the address provided below, indicating that you no longer want to receive information relating to this Site.

**4\. Security**

Security of information communicated by or to us over the Internet is of utmost concern to us; however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. This Site incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity and privacy of the personal information we have collected. We have put in place reasonable precautions to protect information from loss, misuse and alteration, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and database encryption. Please do not use email to communicate information to us that you consider confidential. While we strive to protect your personal information, Emdeon cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through this Site.

**5\. Disclosure of Information Through Business Transfers**

As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, and in so doing, acquire customer information. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. Similarly, in the event that a portion or substantially all of Emdeon's assets are sold or transferred to a third party, customer information (including Personally Identifiable Information) would likely be one of the transferred business assets.

**6\. Our Commitment to Children's Privacy**

Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. The Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA") defines a "Child" as anyone under the age of 13. Emdeon strictly adheres to COPPA. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information obtained through our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Site is structured to attract anyone under 13.

**7\. External Links**

This Site may provide links to various websites that we do not control. When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred out of our Site and connected to the website of the organization or company that you selected. We are not responsible for the nature, quality or accuracy of the content or opinions expressed on such websites, or of the services provided through such websites. Such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for quality, accuracy or completeness by us. Inclusion of any linked website on this Site does not imply or express an approval or endorsement of the linked website by us, or of any of the content, opinions, products or services provided on these websites. Even if an affiliation exists between our Site and a third-party website, we exercise no control over linked sites. Each of these linked sites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. While Emdeon expects its partners and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users, Emdeon cannot be responsible for the actions of third parties. If you visit a website that is linked to from our Site, we encourage you to consult that website's privacy policy before providing any personal information and whenever interacting with any website.

**8\. Consent and Modifications to Privacy Policy**

This Site is controlled, operated and administered entirely within the United States. By using this Site, you signify your agreement to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not disclose any personal information through this Site. This Policy and the use of this Site are governed by Tennessee law. Any claim related to the Site or this Policy shall be brought in a federal or state court in Nashville, Tennessee, within one year after the claim arises. Users of the Site consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts as the most convenient and appropriate for the resolution of disputes concerning this Policy. This Policy and the notices outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any third party.

**9\. Special Notice to California Residents**

Under the California Civil Code, residents of the State of California that have provided any Personally Identifiable Information to Emdeon have the right to request a list of all third parties to which Emdeon has disclosed Personally Identifiable Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if Emdeon has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of Personally Identifiable Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, Emdeon may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options free of charge. Emdeon qualifies for the alternative option and has adopted a policy of not disclosing the personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option that prevents that information from being disclosed to third parties for those purposes. It has established this Policy that provides you with details on how you may either opt-out of the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and would like to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request to [brandcentral@emdeon.com](mailto:brandcentral@emdeon.com) with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent.

**10\. Modifications to Privacy Policy**

Emdeon may modify this Policy at any time, at its discretion, and modifications are effective upon being posted on this Site. You are responsible for reviewing this Policy periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes to it.

**11\. Account Revisions, Revoking  & Deleting Personal Information**
