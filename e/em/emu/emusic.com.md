We are committed to protecting your privacy and respect your privacy concerns. Ensuring your understanding of how we collect, use and maintain your information is important to eMusic. In short, this privacy policy is intended to explain our privacy practices and inform you as to:

  * the types of information we collect from you and how that information is collected;
  * how we use such information;
  * the circumstances under which we disclose such information to others;
  * the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to modify, such information; and
  * the mechanisms we have implemented designed to protect your personally identifiable information.



## Information We Collect

We collect information about you when you visit and use our site and services (collectively, the "Site"), and particularly when you enter or input information, whether during the course of entering, initiating, fulfilling and transmitting information or otherwise in connection with your general activities and/or use of the Site. You can visit the Site and learn about eMusic, our related products and services, and find out how to contact us without giving us any personally identifiable information.

We collect personally identifiable information from you in a variety of contexts. For example, you may be required to provide such information to us if you: (1) complete an online registration form (e.g., various sign-up forms for receiving email newsletters, registering for special offers, promotions or programs, registering for an account, entering a contest/sweepstakes or responding to a survey); (2) fill out an order form to request information; (3) register to participate in message boards and chat rooms (if any) and other community features; or (4) purchase any products or services from us or any other Dimensional businesses. Such information may include your name, email address, mailing address and zip code, phone number, and, where appropriate, a valid credit card number with expiration date. Of course, you never have to answer any of the questions we ask you (nor choose to view or listen to any multimedia content or otherwise interact with our Site), but refusal to do so may limit the products or services we can offer or provide to you.

We automatically track certain information based upon your use of the Site
