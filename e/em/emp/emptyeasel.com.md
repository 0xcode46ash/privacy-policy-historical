# EmptyEasel Privacy Policy

I'm not a lawyer by any means, but I wanted to take a moment to write out EmptyEasel's privacy policy, and explain how your personal privacy is protected when you visit this website. Here are the details if you're interested: 

1\. We use third-party cookies from **Google Analytics** to watch for technical issues and improve things for anyone visiting EmptyEasel.com. For example, we keep track of which pages are most visited, which pages visitors arrive at, time of visits, etc. However, no personally identifiable information about you is collected or stored. You can opt out of Google Analytics tracking by using [Google's privacy plugin](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). 

In a similar way, the **Google Adsense** ads on EmptyEasel make use of cookies too, so you may see some ads that relate to other webisites you've visited. If you'd like to opt out of Google's ad targeting process you can do that at any time by visiting Google's [Advertising and Privacy Page](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

2\. At times, I offer coaching services, website makeovers, or other personal help for artists through a pop-up delivered by **MailChimp**. MailChimp uses a cookie to see if you've already declined those offers, so that you will not be bothered again. If you decide to contact me through one of those offers, _only_ the information you choose to send me will stored in my MailChimp account. That information will not be shared with or used by anyone other than myself, and I will _only_ contact you about the offer you were interested in. If you would like your information permanently removed from my account in MailChimp, please [contact me](https://web.archive.org/contact/) and I will delete it promptly. 

(Note: you can also delete cookies from your browser or device at any time, including cookies from other websites. For step-by-step instructions on how to do that, [Indiana University has an excellent page of tutorials](https://kb.iu.edu/d/ahic) that will help.) 

3\. If you choose to share your name and email address with me via the [contact form](https://web.archive.org/contact/), [artwork submission form](https://web.archive.org/artwork-submission-form/), or [article submission form](https://web.archive.org/article-submission-form/) please know that your information will never be given or sold to a third party. I may use your email address to contact you, but that's all. If at any time you'd like me to delete your address or previous emails, please let me know and I will do so immediately. 

4\. If you choose to sign up for EmptyEasel's free [weekly newsletter](https://web.archive.org/newsletter), your email address will be recorded and kept secure through Feedburner, which I use to distribute my weekly email. Neither Feedburner nor myself will give or sell your address to any third party. 

Naturally, after signing up you'll receive weekly emails from EmptyEasel, but you can unsubscribe from that service at any time by using the link at the bottom of the weekly newsletter, or by [contacting me](https://web.archive.org/contact/) directly. 

5\. You'll notice that throughout EmptyEasel there are links to other websites which I have no control over. Your privacy is assured _here_ , but obviously I cannot guarantee what these other sites may do with your information. 

And. . . that's all there is to it. If you'd like to know anything else about my privacy polices, use of cookies, or anonymous data collection that's not covered here, please [contact me](https://web.archive.org/contact/) and I'll answer promptly.
