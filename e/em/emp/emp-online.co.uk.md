Ordering at EMP is very easy. We offer a free registration service, where all necessary personal information can be saved using a username and password, so that this information can automatically be entered each time you wish to place an order. The EMP Account makes ordering easier in the following ways:

  * You no longer need to enter your Personal Details when placing an order
  * You can access and change your Personal Details in "My EMP" or delete your customer account completely



The registration is free and you have no obligation to order.

You can delete your customer account at any time. You can do this in the "My EMP" section (once you have logged in to your account). To delete the account, simply click the link "Delete my account irrevocably now". Please note that once the account has been deleted, you must re-register if you wish to place a new order.
