# Privacy Policy

This is the web site of Empire Today, LLC. Our postal address is: 

Empire Today, LLC   
333 Northwest Ave.   
Northlake, IL 60164 

We can be reached via telephone at 1.800.588.2300. We can be reached via e-mail at WEBCustomerService@empire-today.com. This Policy is effective as of August 1, 2005. 

Empire Today uses Google Analytics software to track user traffic patterns throughout the website. Google Analytics breaks down overall usage and demographic statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). Google Analytics also retains keywords typed into search engines when users attempt to find our site. The collected data is not tied to any single individual (e.g. no individual profiles are created). 

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web page, to contact consumers for marketing purposes, and is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. If you supply us with your postal address on-line, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by e-mailing us at the above address. Please provide us with your exact name and address. We will be sure your name is removed from the list we share with other internal organizations. 

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers on-line may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such telephone calls, please let us know by calling 1.800.588.2300. Please provide us with your name and phone number. 

If a consumer requests a copy of our "Do Not Call" policy, we will send a copy via U.S. mail. 

Consumers may request, by telephone or in writing, that our company stop calling them and place their name on a "Do Not Call" list. Although we may ask for your name, address and telephone number, we will accept your request even if you only provide your telephone number. You have a right to have calls stopped and to be put on our "Do Not Call" list even if you are still a customer. 

When we receive your request, your telephone number is added to our "Do Not Call" list within 7 business days. In some cases it may take up to 15 business days for your telephone number to be removed from other company wide calling lists. Your request will stay on our list for at least 5 years. If you move, change your telephone number, or add an additional telephone number, you must provide us with the new telephone number in order for us to prevent calls to that number. We will not share the information you provide with anyone except affiliated companies or subsidiaries without your prior written permission. 

All employees that engage in outbound telephone solicitation are trained in this policy and made aware of these procedures before they are allowed to place calls to consumers. Managers, supervisors, or trainers review the policy with these employees annually. 

If the consumer notifies us that they have received a telephone call from us after they have already requested to be placed on our "Do Not Call" list, we will apologize for the intrusion and have a manager or supervisor investigate. The manager or supervisor will also personally confirm that the telephone number is on the "Do Not Call" list. Upon request, we will mail the consumer a confirmation that their telephone number is on the list. The methods and procedures in this "Do Not Call" policy are reviewed by Call Center Project Manager annually. 

If you have any questions, comments or concerns please contact us at: Compliance Department; Empire-Today LLC.; 333 Northwest Avenue; Northlake, Illinois, 60164; (800) 588-2300. 

With respect to ad servers: We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies. From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes to our web site. We will use for these new purposes only data collected from the time of the policy change forward. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically. Customers may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by calling us at the above telephone number. We do not provide site visitors with access to the information that we have collected and maintain about them and provide no on-line ability to have factual inaccuracies corrected. 

With respect to security: we have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site. If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact us at the above addresses or phone number.
