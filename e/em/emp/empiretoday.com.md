This Privacy Policy explains what information Empire Today, LLC  ("Company” or “we”) collects on this web site ("Web Site"), how Company uses that information and the Web Site’s other privacy practices. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at this Web Site, and does not cover any information collected at any other web site by Company or any other related or unrelated company (unless specifically stated) or collected offline by Company, unless specifically stated.

**_INFORMATION COLLECTED, HOW COMPANY USES THAT INFORMATION, AND YOUR CHOICES_**

**Personally Identifiable Information**

We may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number) on various pages of the Web Site, such as when you schedule an in-home estimate, apply for a job online, or otherwise contact us. Providing us with information about yourself is voluntary, but if you choose not to provide certain information you may not be able to take advantage of all of the Web Site’s features.

We may also collect personally identifiable information from you offline, such as when you call to schedule an in-home estimate or otherwise call our customer service center. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected in these circumstances. However, we may combine the information we collect from you offline with information that we collect through the Web Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personally identifiable information that has been combined.

We may also receive information about you from other sources, such as our third party suppliers. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information that we collect through the Web Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personally identifiable information received.

Company may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with requested information or services, to e-mail you additional information you have indicated you would like to receive, to contact you in connection with your scheduled appointment for an in-house estimate, to process your application for employment and prepare governmental and internal statistical reports, or for other purposes disclosed when you provide your information. In addition, Company may use your telephone number and mailing address to contact you with information, such as new products and services or upcoming events.  We may use your information for internal business purposes, such as to improve the Web Site and our business strategies, or to serve specific content to you. We may also contact you regarding any problems or questions we have relating to your use of the Web Site, or, in our discretion, notify you of changes to our Privacy Policy or other policy or terms that affect you or your use of the Web Site.

If you send a friend a communication from the Web Site, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose, unless we obtain additional consent.

Please note that information submitted to the Web Site via a “contact us,” or other similar e-mail address or form will not necessarily receive a response. We will not use the information provided to these e-mail addresses or forms for marketing purposes unrelated to your request, unless otherwise disclosed at the time you provide your information.
