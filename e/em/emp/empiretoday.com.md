**The Full Detailed Privacy Policy**

**1.         What Information Does the Site Collect?**

**(a)                ****Information You Provide to Us**

**Personal Information and Demographic Information**.  On the Site, we may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, home address, and phone number (“ **Personal Information** ”); and (2) demographic information, such as information like your zip code (“ **Demographic Information** ”).  We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Site, including when you schedule an in-home consultation/estimate, apply for a position with the Company, complete a survey, through “contact us” forms, or when you otherwise interact with the Site.  Providing us with information about yourself is voluntary, but if you choose not to provide certain information you may not be able to take advantage of all of the Site’s features.  However, if we combine Demographic Information with the Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Site, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.

We may also collect Personal Information from you offline, such as when you call to schedule an in-home estimate or otherwise call our customer service center.  This Privacy Policy generally does not apply to any information collected in these circumstances.  However, if we combine Personal Information we collect from you offline with the Personal Information we collect through the Site, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.

**  (b)       Information We Collect and Store as You Access and Use the Site**

In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Site, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Site (“ **Usage Information** ”).  This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “ **Device** ”) whenever you visit or interact with our Site.  To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Site, we will treat it as Personal Information.

This Usage Information may include:

  * your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier (“ **Device Identifier** ”).  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Site, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;
  * your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);
  * the URL that referred you to our Site;
  * the areas within our Site that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;
  * your Device location;
  * your Device characteristics; and
  * certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.



We may use various methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (“ **Tracking Technologies** ”).  Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device.  A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):

**_Cookies_**.  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site.  HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage and do not require a plug-in.  Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.  Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard.  Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to HTML5 cookies.  Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Site may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Site your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.

**_Web Beacons_**.  Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our Site’s pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.

**_Embedded Scripts_**.  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

**_ETag, or entity tag_**.  A feature of the cache in browsers.  It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.  If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned.  Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier.  ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.

We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:

**_Strictly Necessary_**.  We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Site, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of appointment scheduling functionality.

**_Performance-Related_**.  We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Site, including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the Site.

**_Functionality-Related_**.  We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the Site, including identifying you when you sign-in to our Site or keeping track of our specified preferences, including in terms of the presentation of content on our Site.

**_Targeting-Related_**.  We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content relevant to your interests on our Site and third-party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content.  This includes using Tracking Technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the content that has been delivered to you. 

There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Site.  Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies with our Site.  We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them.  However, you consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Site and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties. 

**(c)         Information Third Parties Provide About You**

We may also receive information about you from other sources, such as our third party suppliers and data improvement and other service providers for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you.  To the extent we combine information we receive from those sources with your Personal Information we collect on the Site, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise.  In no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.

**(d)**         **Interactions with Third-Party Sites**

The Site may now or in the future include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Site and your account on a third-party web site or application.  The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us.  For example, we may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Site to facilitate your sending a communication from the Site.  For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings.  These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy.  Company may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties.  Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices.  You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Site.

**(e)         Information You Provide About a Third Party **

You may send someone else a communication from the Site, such as sending an invitation to a friend.  If so, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, mobile number, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used by us for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Site, your e-mail address, mobile number, name or user name and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s).  Some of these tools may be third-party tools subject to third-party privacy policies.

**(b)         Use of Information for Recruitment Purposes**.  Where you have provided us with Personal Information or Demographic Information as part of an online application for employment or internship, we may use that information in order to allow us to make an informed decision about whether to proceed with your application.  We may, as part of this recruitment process, collect information about your education, employment history and similar matters.  Where this Personal Information or Demographic Information is considered to be sensitive, you expressly consent to our processing of this information for recruitment purposes by submitting it to us.

**(b)         Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf**.  We may use third-party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of us or the Site, such as hosting the Site, designing and/or operating the Site’s features, tracking the Site’s activities and analytics, and enabling us to send you special offers or perform other administrative services.  We may provide these vendors with access to user information, including Device Identifiers and Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us.  Third-party analytics and other service providers may set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, potentially including Personal Information, about you.  We are not responsible for those third party technologies or activities arising out of them.  However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available **[here](https://web.archive.org/about-empire/privacy-policy-chart)**. **   **We are not responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties’ opt-out options.

Third-party applications may also be available via the Site.  The owners of these applications (“ **Third-Party Owners** ”) may collect Personal Information and other data from you and may have their own policies and practices.  We are not responsible for how Third-Party Owners or their applications collect or use your information and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others.  These Third-Party Owners may have their own terms of use, privacy policies or other policies and ask you to agree to the same.  We are not responsible for these third-party privacy policies or the practices of Third-Party Owners.  Be sure to review any available policies before submitting any personally identifiable information to a third-party application or otherwise interacting with it and exercise caution in connection with these applications.  We also encourage you to note when you leave our Site and to review the third-party privacy policies of all third-party locations and exercise caution in connection with them.

**6.          Ads and Information About You**

We may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements across the Internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party sites and viewing of ads and of our content.  Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your activities across the Internet and mobile media (“ **Behavioral Ads** ”).  In addition, we may serve ads on our Site based on your Usage Information (“ **Contextual Ads** ”).  Behavioral Ads and Contextual Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.  If you object to Contextual Ads, do not use our Site.  If you object to receiving Behavioral Ads from us on third party sites, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below. 

Our third party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including Flash cookies), web beacons and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier.  These third party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. 

Third party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even those used to serve our ads.  Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third party advertisers and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect.  We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice.  The relevant third parties' terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices.  We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.

Further, while third party sites may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“ **NAI** ”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members.  Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads.  Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.  Additional information is available on the NAI’s web site accessible by the above link.  You may also opt-out of receiving Behavioral Ads on participating sites and services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (“ **DAA** ”) website at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed.  Similar limitations may apply to the DAA opt-out.  We are not responsible for effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties’ opt-out options or programs.
