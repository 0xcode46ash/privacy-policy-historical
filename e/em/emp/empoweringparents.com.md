#### INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

**Personal Information**  
In some areas of our Web Site, we may request that you provide personal information, including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and any other information from which your identity is discernable (“personal information”).  If you place an order through our online store, we will ask you to provide credit, debit, or other financial account information as well as your contact and billing information.  Other examples of pages where we may collect personal information are pages where you complete an online registration form to participate in any blog feature or discussion forum made available through the Web Site, register to receives our e-mail newsletters, or submit a question through the “Contact” link on the Web Site. 

**Sharing Personal Information**  
We may disclose personal information to contractors or service providers that help us provide services to you or deliver products or services to you. For example, we may disclose your billing information to payment processors to process fee payments or other financial transactions; we may disclose your shipping address to fulfillment and shipping contractors to deliver a product to you; and, we may disclose your email address to email fulfillment contractors to send you emails from us.  We may share your personal information with other reputable organizations for their marketing purposes.

We may share some or all of your personal information with our subsidiaries and affiliates, joint venturers, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “affiliates”), in which case we will require these affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.  If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the personal information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or to comply with valid legal process (such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order), to protect the company’s rights or property (including without limitation in the event of a transfer of control of company or substantially all of its assets), or during emergencies when safety is at risk. 

**Non-Personally-Identifiable Information**  
We may collect non-personally-identifiable information about your computer and navigation patterns.  When you visit our sites, our systems may automatically note your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer’s operating system, the browser you use for Internet access, and the specific web pages visited during your connection.  We may also track data such as the total number of visits to the Web Site, and the number of visitors to each page of the Web Site. 

We may use non-personally-identifiable information to determine which pages you visit, and in what order your visit them, in order to help us improve our sites.  We may also use non-personally-identifiable information in aggregate form for system maintenance and to better understand how our visitors use our site and services so that we can make them better.  We may share statistical or demographic information in aggregate form with third parties for marketing or research purposes.  This aggregate data will not contain any personal information.

This Web Site is intended for adults.  We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.  However, if the parent or guardian of a child under 13 believes that the child has provided us with personal information, the parent or guardian of that child should contact us if they want this information deleted from our files.  If we otherwise obtain knowledge that we have personal information about a child under 13 in its files, we will delete that information from our existing files so that it is not in retrievable form.

Notwithstanding our data security procedures, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be completely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control, and we cannot absolutely guarantee the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information exchanged between you and us through this Web Site. We make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will prevent unauthorized access to your personal information.

#### PRIVACY POLICIES OF THIRD PARTIES

When you use our Web Site, you may interact with or link to third parties that operate their own web sites and have their own privacy policies.  Also, companies with whom we share your information have their own privacy policies.  Other companies that may place advertisements on our sites may collect information about you through the use of cookies when you view or click on their advertising.  We are not responsible for the policies and practices of these third parties.

#### USE OF COOKIES AND TAGGING

Like many commercial websites, we analyze how readers use this site through what is known as "cookie" technology. A "cookie" is a small text file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. A cookie is not an app or program and has no ability to read the data residing on your computer. We cannot instruct it to execute functions or take any actions. Cookies do not provide us with any personal data or information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. 

Similarly, we use what is known as "client-side page tagging" to write certain information about the page and the visitor to a log when a page is rendered by your web browser. This technique is also commonly used on commercial websites. "Tagging" does result in a small amount of JavaScript running on your computer, but it is limited to providing information about the page that you are requesting and the configuration of your browser. It will not read any of your data files, or execute any additional programs. It does not extract any personal information about you, such as your name or address. You can prevent tagging by disabling JavaScript in your browser, but that may prevent you from using all of our website's functions. 

#### HOW WE USE THIS INFORMATION

We use tools from Google, Adobe and others to help collect aggregate data, such as browser type, connection speed, referring/exit pages, device type, date/time stamp, and the number of clicks to help us analyze trends, administer the site and make improvements. This information is not linked to any personally identifiable information you may share with us. 

Google and Adobe may also provide anonymous information about your visits to this and other websites (such as age and gender) to help us improve the content on our web site, refine our products and provide information about our other products and services that might be of interest to you. 

You can obtain more information about this practice and to identify your choices about not having this information used by Google and Adobe from their respective web sites. You can opt-out of cookie-based tracking at any time by simply clearing your browser's cookie cache or activating your web browser’s “do not track” function.
