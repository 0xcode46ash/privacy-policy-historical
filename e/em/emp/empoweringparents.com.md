**Your privacy on EmpoweringParents.com:**

We want you to feel secure when visiting our site and are committed to maintaining your privacy when doing so. The following provides an overview of how we protect your privacy during your visit. 

**What information do we gather?**

Information on EmpoweringParents.com is gathered in two ways: (1) indirectly (for example, through our site's technology); and (2) directly (for example, when you provide information on various pages of EmpoweringParents.com). One example of information we collect indirectly is through our Internet access logs. When you access EmpoweringParents.com, your Internet address is automatically collected and is placed in our Internet access logs. We collect information directly from you in a number of ways, some of which we describe in this Privacy Statement. One way is through the use of cookies. Cookies are small files of information which save and retrieve information about your visit to EmpoweringParents.com - for example, how you entered our site, how you navigated through the site, and what information was of interest to you. The cookies we use identify you merely as a number. (If you are uncomfortable regarding cookies use, please keep in mind you can disable cookies on your computer by changing the settings in preferences or options menu in your browser.) We also collect information when you voluntarily submit it to us. 

**How do we use this information?**

We analyze it to determine what is most effective about our site, to help us identify ways to improve it, and eventually, to determine how we can tailor EmpoweringParents.com to make it more effective. We may also use data for other purposes, which we would describe to you at the point we collect the information. 

**Will we share this with outside parties?**

We will not sell individual information and will share it only with credit card processing firms in order to complete the sale. 

**What about sensitive personal data?**

We do not generally seek to collect sensitive personal data through this site. 

**Do we give you access to your information?**

You are entitled to know whether we hold information about you and, if we do, to have access to that information and require it to be corrected if it is inaccurate. You can do this by contacting us via our webmaster at webmaster@EmpoweringParents.com. 

**What about data security?**

We take appropriate steps to maintain the security of your data on EmpoweringParents.com. You should understand that the open nature of the Internet is such that data may flow over networks without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended. That's it in a nutshell. The short of it is we are interested in maintaining your privacy and creating a valuable resource for you to use. If you have any questions now or during your visit, please contact us via our webmaster at webmaster@EmpoweringParents.com.
