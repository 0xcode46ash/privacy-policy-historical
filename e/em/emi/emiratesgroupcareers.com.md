 **10\. Access to your personal information**  
You have the right to see personal information we keep about you. We will endeavour to provide the information you require within a reasonable time.

If you are concerned that any of the information we hold on you is incorrect please [contact us](mailto:Fatima.almazam@emirates.com). 

 **11\. Transfer of your personal information**  
Some parties that process or store personal information may be located in jurisdictions outside your country of residence. Therefore, your information may be processed and stored in these jurisdictions and, as a result, foreign governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws in these countries

 **12\. Notification of changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by way of an email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

 **13\. What is recruitment fraud?  
** It has come to our attention that various people and organisations unrelated to the Emirates Group are sending emails or otherwise contacting individuals offering fraudulent  employment opportunities in the Emirates Group. These people and organisations may request personal information or money from you in order to progress the application. We would therefore advise that you never provide your bank account or credit card details as part of a job application. 

During our recruitment process you would always meet in person with an Emirates Group employee or representative for an interview before any formal offer of employment is made. 

Emirates Group will never ask for money transfers or payment of any kind from job applicants., and will never ask for advance payment from you towards travel expenses or visas/work permits if your application is successful.   Be wary of anyone who asks you for money in order to take up a job opportunity with Emirates Group as this offer will be fraudulent... 

If you receive an email that appears to be from Emirates that instructs you to send replies to an email address other than one ending with “@emirates.com”, please treat it as fraudulent and notify us through the recruitment help desk so we can take appropriate action as quickly as possible.
