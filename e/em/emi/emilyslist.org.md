###  Resale or disclosure of information to third parties 

To process credit card contributions, deliver a personalized experience on our website, and provide information about our activities, EMILY's List and Team EMILY collect some information that can be directly associated with a specific person. We call this "personal information," and it includes names, addresses, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses. In the case of those who make contributions through the site, it also includes credit card information and the answers to questions which we ask in order to ensure we can legally accept your contribution. 

It is the general policy of EMILY's List and Team EMILY not to make personal information available to anyone other than its employees or agents who need to know that information in the course of their duties. We do not exchange, trade, rent, or give email lists to third parties. 

However, EMILY's List is often required to disclose some personal information to federal, state or local government authorities. For example, federal law requires us to use our best efforts to collect and report the name, mailing address, occupation and name of employer of individuals whose contributions aggregate in excess of $200 in a calendar year. Similarly, when you donate to a candidate through EMILY's List, the law may require us to provide information regarding your donation to the candidates' campaign organizations for reporting purposes. 

We will use your e-mail address to confirm on-line contributions and we may use your phone number and or e-mail address to contact you if we need any additional information about your contribution. We will also use your e-mail address to send you important news and updates from EMILY's List and Team EMILY. If you do not wish to receive these e-mails, please take one of the following actions to request to be unsubscribed: send an email to [information@emilyslist.org](mailto:information@emilyslist.org) and ask to be removed, or send us your full name and email address via United States Mail at 1120 Connecticut Avenue, Ste. 1100, NW, Washington, D.C. 20036.

EMILY’s List utilizes third party software to manage our e-mail lists. The list server software is configured to refuse to divulge the e-mail addresses of our list subscribers to anyone but authorized EMILY’s List staff or agents.

###  Children's privacy 

Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulation establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we have designed our sites to block our knowing acceptance of information from children under 13 whenever age-related information is requested. We would remind parents that they have a duty to supervise the Internet activities of their children. 

It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from our servers. If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by children under 13, please do so by emailing us at [information@emilyslist.org](mailto:information@emilyslist.org). 

###  Security 

EMILY's List maintains a variety of physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. For example, we use commercially reasonable tools and techniques to protect against unauthorized access to our systems. Also, we restrict access to personal information to those employees and agents who need to know that information in the course of their duties. We work to protect the security of your personal information when transmitted via our site by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. In addition, we have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss or misuse of information that we have collected from you at our site. 

You should know that EMILY's List has no control over the security of other sites on the Internet you might visit, interact with, or use to make financial transactions. Your own efforts to protect against unauthorized access play an important role in protecting the security of your personal information. You should be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer, and always log out of any site when viewing personal information. Also, we may have links to other, outside websites that we do not control. We are not responsible for the content or privacy policies of these sites.
