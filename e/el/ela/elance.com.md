THE WORKSPACE

communication and the exchange and sharing of information between Clients and Service Providers once a

INFORMATION WE GATHER

If you register to buy or sell Services using Elance, we collect and store Personal Information that
specifically identifies you or your Account. At this time, the most information you would be required to submit
is your first name, last name, User ID, password, preferred currency, street address, city, state, zip/postal
code, country, phone number, email address and valid financial Account information. Other information
requested on our Registration page, including the ability to receive promotional offers from Elance, is
optional. We may, in the future, include other optional requests for information from you to help us to tailor
the Site for you and deliver personalized information to you. Without your agreement, we will not share, rent
or sell any personal information with third parties in any way other than what is disclosed in this privacy
statement. To post projects in both Select and Limited, we require a valid credit card number and name as it
appears on the credit card. A refundable $25 deposit is collected for Select Projects (refunded when you
award the project), and no charges are made to the card if the project is posted in Limited.
Credit card information is transmitted via SSL ("Secure Socket Layer") encryption for your protection.
Team Accounts
If you are a User of a Team Account, the information you provide to the Site may be accessible to other
Users of the Account under which your Team Account was added, and Users of all related Team Accounts.
Referral Program
If you sign up under the Elance Referral Program, you will be required to provide: a User ID, a password,
email address, city, state, country and zip/postal code. It further requests the URL of your Web site, the
number of registered Users on your Site, and a brief general description of your Site. We will use this
information for our own internal purposes, including evaluating and developing new features that better meet
the needs of our affiliates. We will use the email address that you provide to us to contact you regarding the
status of your Account, and we will use the address that you provide to us to send you any payments owed
to you under the terms of the Referral Program.
Online Surveys and Contests
Occasionally, Elance conducts a User survey to collect information about our Users' preferences. These
surveys are optional and if you choose to respond, your responses will be kept anonymous. Similarly, we
may offer contests to qualifying Users in which we ask for contact and demographic information such as
name, email address and mailing address. None of this information is shared with third parties, except in
                                                          2


summary form, if at all. The demographic information that Elance collects in the registration process and
through surveys is used to help us improve our Services to meet the needs and preferences of our Users.
This may include targeting advertising to you about our Services. Information we gather through a contest
may also be disclosed to third parties as necessary for prize fulfillment and other aspects of any contest or
similar offering.
The Elance Payment System
The Elance Payment Service requires Members to pay with a credit card, wire transfer, ACH or debit card or
check. Elance will collect your credit card number and/or other entered financial institution information such
as bank account numbers and will use that information to bill your Service Provider membership fee and/or
to perform the billing operation on behalf of the Service Provider, including but not limited to the use and
disclosure of such credit card number and information to third parties as necessary to complete such billing
operation. Verification of credit information, however, is accomplished solely by the User through the
authentication process.
Service providers and Agents
We use credit card and other payment processing companies to bill you for goods and services and email
marketing companies to send emails from Elance to opt-in users. We will share your personal information as
necessary for third parties to provide these services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use
personally identifiable information for any other purposes.
Automatically Gathered Information
Elance automatically collects browser type and browser software version to tailor the presentation of the Site
and the Services to the Visitor's or User's platform and to maintain a record of the User's or Visitor's activity
on the Site. As an automatic process, our Web server software records a log file of IP addresses that access
the Site. We also collect IP address information but do not ordinarily link IP addresses to Users' Personal
Information. However, we can and will use IP addresses to identify a User when we, in our sole discretion,
determine that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms and Conditions of Use or to protect our
service, Site, customers or others. When you use the Site, Elance collects information about your Account
transactions and Elance may collect information about your computer for fraud prevention purposes. Finally,
Elance may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here.
For example, Elance may collect information related to your contact with Elance Customer Service or store
results when you respond to a survey.
Cookies
When you use the Site, Elance or our contractors may place small data files called cookies on your
computer. Elance uses cookies to enable Users to specify unique preferences and to track Visitor and User
use of the site, including trends and patterns. Elance sends a session cookie to your computer when you log
in to your Account. This type of cookie helps if you visit multiple pages on the Site during the same session,
so that you don't need to enter your password on each page. Once you log out or close your browser, this
cookie expires. Elance also uses longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to display your project
related information. Elance encodes our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them.
Users and Visitors always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. If you disable
cookies on your browser, please note that some parts of our Site may not function as effectively or may be
considerably slower.
Email to Friends Feature and Referral Program
Elance lets you easily send project postings to friends via email. Elance also offers the ability to send friends
emails about providing or purchasing Services through Elance. If you choose to use either feature, be
assured that Elance only uses your friends' email addresses on a one-time basis to send the requested
posting, and we use your email address to copy you on the message or to send on your behalf. Your friends'
email addresses will be deleted from our database after the message is sent.

including the providers of online communications services, will have rights to use and disclose the Personal
Information collected in connection with the provision of these services in accordance with their own privacy
policies. In particular, the provider of online chat services will have the right to use the Personal Information

our Site to enable work on the project to be completed. In addition, Members involved in a transaction may
request full contact information of the other party, including name, company name, phone number and
mailing address. If you request the contact information of another User, your contact information will also be
released to that User. If another User requests your contact information, we will disclose it to him or her. You

Services or resolving a dispute.

good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or
warrants served on us; (b) protect or defend the rights or property of Elance or third parties; (c) assist in an
investigation; or (d) respond to an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of Users or other persons.
