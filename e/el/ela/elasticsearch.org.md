#### Third Parties

Elasticsearch uses third parties for certain processing, such as hosting and management of our Websites. As far as these third parties have access to Personal Data in order to execute these processings, Elasticsearch has taken the required organizational and contractual measures to ensure that your Personal Data is exclusively processed for the purposes mentioned above.

We may share your Personal Data with service providers, business partners and others, consistent with applicable law.  If we are required by law to obtain your consent, or otherwise in our discretion believe that your consent is appropriate in the circumstances, we will obtain your consent before we share your Personal Data.For example, Elasticsearch may sell you a product or offer you a service in a joint marketing effort with another company (“ **Business Partners** “). We will let you know that such relationship exists and who these companies are, prior to your registration.  Many times, these companies have their own privacy policies which may differ from the privacy policy of Elasticsearch.

We have agreements with these Business Partners that will limit the purposes for which your Personal Data can be used and that require your Personal Data to be adequately safeguarded.  We will not sell your Personal Data to third parties for their own purposes.

Only if Elasticsearch is required to do so by law, your Personal Data will be provided to supervisory agencies, fiscal authorities and investigative agencies.
