To provide our merchants with transaction processing services and related products, including but not limited to credit card, charge card, debit card, loyalty card, gift card and stored value card transaction processing services, as well as other value-added products and services that we may offer or that a merchant may request from us and we agree to provide to merchants from time to time (collectively, the "Elavon Services") as effectively and conveniently as possible, we may provide our affiliates (and other organizations that help us serve our merchants) with access to personal information provided to us in the course of our relationship with our merchant customers.

"Personal Information" is information about identifiable individuals directly connected with the merchant. The merchant and each such individual are collectively referred to herein as "you" or "your".
