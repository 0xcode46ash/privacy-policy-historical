### Notice to European Users

Any information you supply may be stored and processed on our computers in the United States, which does not have data protection laws that provide the same protections as the laws of the Member States of the European Economic Area. However, your information will be handled in compliance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.

Personal data generated in the European Economic Area will be processed in accordance with the European Commission Directive 95/46/EC and applicable laws of the Member States.

Such third party service providers are provided only with such information as is necessary under the circumstances. Information provided to third parties is used only for the purposes stipulated and those third parties are subject to confidentiality obligations. We may also enhance or merge personally identifiable information with data obtained from third parties for any of the foregoing purposes. Nothing in the Privacy Policy shall be deemed to prohibit us from disclosing your identity or information if we are required by law to do so.

### Contacting Us Regarding Your Personally Identifiable Information

If you have submitted personally identifiable information through the Site, or if someone else has submitted your personally identifiable information through the foregoing, and you would like to review, request changes or have that information deleted from our databases, please contact us via e-mail at [privacy@elavon.com](mailto:privacy@elavon.com), or send a letter to our Privacy Compliance Officer at One Concourse Parkway, Suite 300, Atlanta, GA 30328 USA. We will then use reasonable efforts to change or remove your personally identifiable information from our files, unless we are entitled or required to retain it pursuant to other agreements or by law. We will use reasonable efforts to supply you with this information and correct any factual inaccuracies in this information. Notwithstanding the prior two sentences, if your laws provide you with additional protections or require us to comply with more stringent obligations to provide you with, remove, or correct your personally identifiable information, we will comply with those legal requirements.

### Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically

In some cases, we may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include but are not limited to the frequency of your use of this Site and the route by which you choose to access it and your use of any hyperlinks available on this Site. We and our service providers, agents or advisors may process and use this data for purposes including but not limited to, planning Site development, assessing patterns of use, planning and assessing marketing initiatives by us, or to include you in e-mail or mailing lists so that we may send you information or updates and or offer you services.

### Cookies

"Cookies" are small text files that are either used for the duration of a session ('session cookies'), or saved on a user's hard drive in order to identify that user the next time he/she logs on to the Site ('persistent cookies'). We may use 'session cookies' to identify registered users logging in to the Site. These cookies are deleted from the component's server soon after the session ends and are not collected or saved. We may also use 'persistent cookies' when a registered user clicks on the "save password" check box on login. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that, although if you do disable cookies from your browser you may not be able to access certain sections of the Site.

### Security

We use reasonable measures to protect personal information from access by unauthorized persons. This includes, among other things, standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection, and site monitoring. We also use reasonable internal controls to protect personal information from misuse by our employees. Unfortunately, no electronic data or transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we use reasonable measures to protect personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted or otherwise provided to us or received from us. This is especially true for information that is transmitted via e-mail that is unprotected until it reaches our servers. Once a transmission is received, we use the reasonable measures set forth above to secure our servers.

Internally, we restrict access to personally identifiable information to employees who need access to the information in order to do their jobs. These employees are limited in number and are required to comply with our privacy policies.

### Children

This Site is not intended for use by persons under the age of 18. If you are under 18, do not use this Site. If parents believe their minor children have accessed this Site and provided their personally identifiable information, please contact us using the information provided in the "Contact Use Regarding Your Personal Identification Information" section of this Privacy Policy.

### Other Sites

The Site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other websites. Users are encouraged to review the privacy policy of any website linked from the Site.

### Transfer of Business Assets

As we continue to develop our business, we might acquire or buy other businesses or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that all or substantially all of our assets are acquired, both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable user and customer information will be amongst the transferred assets.
