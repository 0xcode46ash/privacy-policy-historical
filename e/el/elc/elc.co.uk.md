# Privacy Policy : Early Learning Centre UK Toy Shop

Can I feel secure using this site?

Yes. We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect to process your order efficiently. We want you to be fully informed about how we guard your privacy, and about how we may use any information we gather about you.

Are my personal details kept private?

Why does ELC need so much information from me when I order?

When you order, we need to know your name, email address, delivery address, credit or debit card number and the card's expiry date. This allows us to process and fulfil your order. As an additional security precaution we also ask for your card security number. This is the last 3 digits on the signature strip on the back of your card. We ask for your telephone number, so we can contact you if there is a query with your order.

From time to time we do ask if you want to be kept you up to date with exciting offers and events at elc.co.uk and in our stores. We do not send you anything unless you have given us permission to do so.
