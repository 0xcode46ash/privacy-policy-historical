###  **Why does ELC need so much information from me when I order?**

When you order, we need to know your name, email address, delivery address, credit or debit card number and the card's expiry date. This allows us to process and fulfil your order. 

As an additional security precaution we also ask for your card security number. This is the last 3 digits on the signature strip on the back of your card. We ask for your telephone number, so we can contact you if there is a query with your order. 

From time to time we do ask if you want to be kept you up to date with exciting offers and events at elc.co.uk and in our stores. We do not send you anything unless you have given us permission to do so. 

If you have signed up to receive marketing communications from us, and want to change your mind, you can at any time. 

If you receive emails from us, simply click the ‘unsubscribe' link at the end of any email you receive from us. If you receive postal mailings simply email your name, address and postcode to [contactus@elc.co.uk](mailto:contactus@elc.co.uk) and we will remove you from our mailing list.
