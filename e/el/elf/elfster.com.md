If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should contact Elfster via the email address help@elfster.com or via postal mail at 4200 Park Blvd. #1225 Oakland, CA 94602. 

The policies below are applicable to Elfster.com, and other sites published by Elfster, Inc. 4200 Park Blvd. #1225, Oakland, CA 94602. 

  


### Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)

Elfster respects each individual user's right to privacy. Elfster does not collect personal identifying information unless such information is specifically and knowingly provided from users during site registration, contests, surveys or use of public areas. From time to time, we share aggregated site traffic information with our partners and advertisers. 

  


### Choice: Opt-In and Opt-Out

Once registered, users who no longer wish to receive general communications may opt-out of (i.e., discontinue receiving) these communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the general communication email and setting their preference. We also offer opt-out mechanisms in the text of each general communication email we send, and the user may contact us at the email or street address at the top of this page to opt-out. 

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can be done at Elfster.com or by contacting us via help@elfster.com. 

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order, or a legal process served on our Web site. 

  


### Security

Elfster uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure. However, Elfster is not responsible for any breach of security. If a Elfster user knowingly provides personal information, such as a name or email address, in an answer or public wishlist item or other public service, that user should be aware that the information provided can be collected and used by third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Elfster. 

  


### Cookies

Non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of Elfster' Internet servers (i.e. log file information like IP address) or through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small text files that our site places on your computer's hard drive to recognize repeat users and facilitate the user's use of the site. Also, our cookies allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data for content improvement, targeted advertising, and marketing and promotional purposes. 

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). Users should be aware that Elfster cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or other third parties. Most browsers allow a user to deny cookies; however, users should note that cookies may be required to provide certain web site features. Also, users may opt out of receving those cookies using a resource such as the Network Advertising Initiative (www.networkadvertising.org). 

  


### Third Party Advertising

Some of the ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by our Web advertising partners. Information about users' visits to this site, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on this site. Please understand we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for third parties to place advertising on Elfster.com. 

  


### ATTENTION KIDS

ATTENTION KIDS: No information should be submitted to Elfster by children under 18 years of age without their parent's or guardian's consent. Elfster does not monitor the age of its user audience. 

  


### Changes and updates

Elfster reserves the right to change this policy at any time by posting notice of the existence of a new privacy statement. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
