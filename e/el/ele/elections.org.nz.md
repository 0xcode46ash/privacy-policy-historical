However, where you voluntarily provide personal information or where you are requested to provide personal information to access certain areas of the site or perform certain functions, such information will be held by the authoring electoral agency in accordance with the law.

Where you are requested to provide personal information, the relevant part of the website will inform you of the reason that information is sought.  We will only use that information according to law and in a manner that is consistent with the reason for which the information was provided.

The electoral agencies are not liable for any loss of privacy, disclosure of information, harm, damage or loss that may result from your transmission of data via the Internet.

The Privacy Act 1993 gives you the right to see and correct information that an electoral agency holds about you.  If you want to access the information held about you, or if you would like to correct any such information held, or if you have any privacy concerns, please contact the agency concerned. 

### Cookies

The Electoral websites are currently using Google Analytics to help analyse how users use our sites.

This analytical tool uses 'cookies', which are text files placed on your computer, to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your computer's internet address or IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google outside of New Zealand. The tracking data is stored in a database managed by Google. The tracking data is then used by Google to compile statistical reports on website activity for the Electoral agencies to evaluate site use. This allows us to:

  *   discover what information is most and least used
  *   determine technical design specifications, and
  *   help make our sites more useful to visitors.



  
We will not use the web analytics tool to track or to collect any personally identifiable information of visitors to our sites. We will not associate any data gathered from our sites with any personally identifying information from any source as part of our use of the Google Analytics tool.

### Email

While we have in place a variety of security measures it is important to remember that email is not secure.  We cannot guarantee the privacy or confidentiality of any information that is sent over the Internet by email.  In accessing and using the Elections website, you accept that electronic mail passing over the Internet may not be free from interception or interference by third parties.

### What happens to the information I supply by enrolling?

#### What is the information about voters used for?

When you enrol, we will publish your name, the address where you reside, and your occupation in the roll of your electorate. The roll is a list of voters which any member of the public can look at and is used on election day for voting. We may give this information to scientific or health researchers, political candidates, members of Parliament or political parties. We can also tell them your age group, postal address and whether you are of Maori descent. The information is also used to make up lists of people who might be called to serve on a jury.

#### Is there any way to stop the information being published?

Yes. If you think you, or your family's personal safety could be at risk because information about you is published in the roll, you can ask to have details put in an unpublished roll. This cannot be looked at by members of the public. However, before we put your details in an unpublished roll, you will need to show us that you or your family's safety could be put at risk. There are a number of ways of doing this, for example showing a protection order, or a restraining order, or a statutory declaration from a member of the police.

#### Access to information

You have the right to ask for access to information held about you by the Registrar of Electors. You may also ask for this information to be corrected.

#### Checking the information

We may carry out information matching with details from a number of government agencies (under authorised information matching programmes) to ensure that the electoral roll is complete and correct.
