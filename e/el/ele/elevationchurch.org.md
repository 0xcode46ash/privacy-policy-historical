Such information is collected only when it is knowingly and voluntarily submitted, and Elevation Church uses such information only for the purpose for which it was submitted, unless we disclose other uses in this policy or at the time of collection.  
We maintain reasonable and appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of such information in our possession.

We reserve the right to monitor visitor traffic patterns and website usage to help us develop the design and layout of our websites to enhance your online experience.

**C. Security**

Our technology partners use industry-leading Internet security technology and practices. They use secure server software (SSL) that encrypts the information you input before you send it to us. All of the data is protected against unauthorized access, as indicated by the secure icon on your browser.

**D. Cookies**

“Cookies” are small bits of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive to enable us to do a number of things to make your visit and future visits more enjoyable. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information about you. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to prevent that. Users should consult their browser help files for instructions on how to refuse cookies. Visitors may also receive cookies from third parties, but Elevation Church cannot control the content of those cookies.

**E. Promotions**

Elevation Church may run promotions on our websites that require submission of personally identifiable information by participants.
