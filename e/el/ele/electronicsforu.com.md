Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy for electronicsforu.com, an online property of EFY Enterprises Pvt Ltd, will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers' changing needs. We may change our privacy practices from time to time. If we make any changes, we'll update this privacy statement accordingly (the date of the most recent change is displayed at the top of this statement). 

Registered users of www.electronicsforu.com enjoy special benefits. Registration is free here, and is a process that enables the team to understand the profile of our users. 

1\. EFY can take back any of the benefits passed to a registered user. 

2\. EFY has the discretion to accept or decline registration of any user. 

3\. EFY expects that contact details (if submitted) are correct. 

4\. EFY reserves the right to send marketing emails on your email-ID for generating revenue. This is the only way EFY can pump in resources for the FREE services being provided. 

5\. EFY at any time may change the categories, sub-categories or any other information that helps to identify your data. 

6\. EFY at any time may change the entire content of the website. 

7\. EFY reserves the right to terminate any or all feature(s) on its own discretion. 

Many of our publications may be subscribed to at reduced rates because they are supported by advertisers. Qualification and registration questionnaires and other processes ensure that our advertisers reach the appropriate audiences. We may use the information we collect from you individually or aggregated with other user's information to improve our publications, to customize these publications, and to notify you about updates or new features. 

In addition, we may use information we collect to notify you of third-party products and services in which you may be interested. In addition to the options made available to you when we collect information (if any), you may elect to "opt out" of having your individually identifiable information shared with third-parties that are not affiliated with EFY (except for uses specifically requested by you, and legitimate business uses). We will update the specific records related to your request as promptly as practical. Note, however, that you may receive additional communications from third parties after you submit your request while we process the request. 

Additionally, your information may exist in multiple lists within the company and our technology limits the processing of opt-out requests to the specific list source. We will continuously assess our responsiveness to opt-out requests against new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.
