# Elecard | Privacy Statement

**Elecard's Online Privacy Policy**

Your right to privacy is very important. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. Below is a summary of our policy. 

**What personal information do we collect?**  
In general, when you visit our websites and access information you remain anonymous. Before we ask you for information, we will explain how this information will be used. We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission. 

Some of our sites require registration to access, although typically all that's requested is an e-mail address and some basic information about you, such as your name. If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of elecard.com. But you will not be able to access areas that require registration. 

**Protecting your privacy**  
We will take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information in storage. 

We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission. However, we may need to provide your name and delivery address to third parties that Elecard uses for the purposes of delivering specific services to you (e.g., customer support, or a shipping company if you have asked us to send something to you.) 

Our websites may provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third party sites. 

**Use of cookies**  
Elecard websites use cookies for various reasons. Cookies enable us to provide you with a better experience by allowing us to understand what areas of the website are of interest to our visitors. These cookies do not track individual information. Elecard also uses cookies when you register for one of our web programs. In this situation, a cookie will store useful information that enables our website to remember you when you return to visit us. Cookies from Elecard websites can only be read by Elecard websites. If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you can still access most of our websites. 

**Data storage in the U.S.**  
Many of our websites that collect information will store and process that information in databases in the United States.
