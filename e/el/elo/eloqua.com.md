# Eloqua Corporation: Lead Generation and Digital Marketing Solutions

**Eloqua believes strongly that every person has the right to privacy.** Eloqua maintains information on its visitors only to provide a better, more personal experience for the visitor, and will never sell or trade any of the information accumulated about a web visitor. Through the use of cookies Eloqua gains information about visitors to a web site. This information is used to make the visitor's web experience more enjoyable by learning about their preferences and browsing behavior. Along with the information gathered to personalize a visitor's experience, aggregate summary information is used to learn about the market as a whole. 

Eloqua feels that if a visitor would like a private online experience then they are entitled to one. Eloqua's products have optional decline features, which allow a visitor to state upfront if they would like to be alone, or opt-out of any contact when requested by an agent. Privacy is very important to Eloqua. This privacy statement describes the conduct and practices of Eloqua Corporation as it applies to our clients and visitors.

**Cookies**  
Eloqua employs cookies in order for its server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user. Cookies are small text files placed in the 'Cookies' folder on a visitor's hard disk and allow for Eloqua to remember the visitor. The cookies placed by the Eloqua server are readable only by Eloqua, and cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on a computer. All web-browsers offer the option to refuse any cookie, and if a visitor refuses the Eloqua cookie then Eloqua does not gather any information on that visitor. 

  


**Information gathered**  
The Eloqua system will gather information such as what kind of browser a visitor is on, what operating system they are using, their IP address, and their clickstream information (for example, which pages they have viewed and how long they have been there). Note that information is only gathered while the visitor is on the website in question -- in this case www.eloqua.com. Eloqua monitors how a visitor arrives at the website, but cannot and will not gather information about other sites the visitor has been on. 

At times, Eloqua may ask for more specific contact information to be entered as a means of registration before accessing a certain part of the site. Eloqua uses this information to understand its visitors and, with permission, to provide visitors with updates on the company and its products. A visitor may always opt not to enter any information about themselves if they so choose. 

  


**Usages of Info**  
Information is gathered about visitors for the sole purpose of serving them better. Web-visit information may be linked to the visitor's business card information if it is available. Personal information gathered by Eloqua or its products is never for sale or trade to anyone, and will not be divulged to a party other than Eloqua and the client who has installed the Eloqua suite on their website. Of course, if required to do so by law, Eloqua will provide specific information to the proper authorities. 

  


**Privacy**  
Eloqua allows each of its client sites to give visitors that require complete anonymity and privacy the option to not be engaged by the Eloqua system. Visitors will have the option of removing themselves from availability immediately upon entering the site by clicking on a privacy button, or when an agent requests a conversation they may opt not to accept. When engaged in an online chat session with an agent, the visitor may end the session at any time. 

  


**Web Monitoring Opt-Out**  
Eloqua believes in permission-based marketing. If you don't want to be invited into a chat session, or if you don't want to be included in our website metrics, you can simply opt-out. [Click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20030413172628id_/http%3A//eloqua.com/privacy/optstatus.asp) to view your current opt-out status. 

  


**Clients**  
Eloqua's products are developed for the use of, and distributed to, third party clients. Eloqua encourages its clients to adopt privacy policies similar to, or more stringent than, its own. Eloqua sells its products only to reputable and ethical clients. Eloqua Corporation cannot be held responsible if a client chooses unethical or immoral use of the information that the Eloqua products gather. 

  


**Reservation of Rights**  
Eloqua Corporation reserves the right to change this privacy statement at any time with 15 days notice being posted to the Eloqua web site.
