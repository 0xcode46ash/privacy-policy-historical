# Eloqua Corporation: Lead Generation and Digital Marketing Solutions

**Eloqua feels that a customer's right to privacy is an important one.** Eloqua maintains information on its guests only to provide a better, more personal experience for the visitor, and will never sell or trade any of the information accumulated about a web visitor. Through the use of cookies Eloqua gains information about customers and visitors to a web site. This information is used to make the customer's web shopping experience more enjoyable by learning about their preferences and browsing behaviour. Along with the information gathered to personalize a customer's experience, aggregate summary information is used to learn about the market as a whole. 

Eloqua feels that if a customer would like a private online shopping experience then they are entitled to one. Eloqua's products have optional decline features, which allow a customer to state upfront if they would like to be alone, or opt out of any contact when requested by an agent. Privacy is very important to Eloqua. This privacy policy describes the conduct and practices of Eloqua Corporation as it applies to our clients and visitors.

**Cookies**  
Eloqua employs cookies in order for its server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user. Cookies are small text files placed in the 'Cookies' folder on a user's hard disk and allows for Eloqua to remember the customer. The cookies placed by the Eloqua server are readable only by Eloqua, and cannot read data off a user's hard disk. All browsers offer a user the option to refuse to accept any cookie sent to him or her, and if this is the case, then Eloqua does not gather any information on that specific user. 

  


**Information gathered**  
The Eloqua system will know what kind of browser a user is on, what operating system they are using, their IP address, and their clickstream information (i.e. where they are going, and how long they have been there). Note that all information is only gathered while the user is on the web site in question. Eloqua has no way of knowing, nor does it want to know, where the user has been before coming to the site in question or where they go after visiting the site that the Eloqua system is operating on. 

At times, Eloqua may ask for more specific contact information to be entered as a means of registration before accessing a certain part of the site. Eloqua uses this information to understand its customers and, with permission, to provide customers with updates on the company and its products. Of course a visitor may always opt not to enter any information about themselves if they so choose. 

  


**Usages of Info**  
Information is gathered about customers for the sole purpose of serving them better. Any personal information gathered by Eloqua or its products is never for sale or trade to anyone, and will not be divulged to a party other than Eloqua and the client who has installed the Eloqua suite on their site unless it is required by law. 

  


**Privacy**  
Eloqua allows each of its client sites to give users that require complete anonymity and privacy the option to not be engaged by the Eloqua system. Customers will have the option of removing themselves from availability immediately upon entering the site by clicking on a privacy button, or when an agent requests a conversation they may opt not to accept. At any time when already in a conversation with an agent, the Just Looking button may be clicked, which will end any contact with an agent. 

  


**Reservation of Rights**  
Eloqua Corporation reserves the right to change this policy at any time with 15 days notice being posted to the Eloqua web site. 

  


**Clients**  
Eloqua's products are developed for the use of, and distributed to, third party clients. Eloqua encourages its clients to adopt privacy policies similar to, or more stringent than, its own. Eloqua sells its products only to reputable and ethical clients. Eloqua Corporation cannot be held responsible for unethical or immoral use of the information by its clients that the Eloqua products gather.
