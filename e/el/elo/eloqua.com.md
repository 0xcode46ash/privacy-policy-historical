# Privacy - Email Marketing Automation | Demand Generation | Eloqua

## Eloqua believes strongly that every person has the right to privacy.

Effective Date: 19 May 2009

When using Eloqua Corporation's ("Eloqua") website, located at the URL [http://www.eloqua.com](http://www.eloqua.com/) (the "Site") and/or services and/or products provided on the Site, you may provide us with personally identifiable information. Eloqua asks for and maintains the personally identifiable information of its visitors and customers to provide a better, more personal experience on the Site and to deliver certain services or information to you. This privacy policy covers the site www.eloqua.com

Eloqua feels that if visitors would like a private online experience then they are entitled to one. Eloqua's products have optional decline features, which allow customers and visitors to state upfront if they would like to be anonymous, as further described below in the Anonymity section, or opt-out of any contact when requested by an agent. Privacy is very important to Eloqua. This Privacy Policy describes the conduct and practices of Eloqua as it applies to our customers and visitors.

**TRUSTe   
**Eloqua is a Participant in the TRUSTe Privacy Seal Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to advance privacy and trust in the networked world.  Eloqua is committed to protecting your privacy. In this regard, Eloqua has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices monitored for compliance by TRUSTe.  
If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact us at [privacy@eloqua.com](mailto:privacy@eloqua.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry, or if your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at <http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Eloqua to address your concerns.

**Cookies**  
Eloqua employs cookies in order for its server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user. Cookies are small text files placed in the 'Cookies' folder on a visitor's hard disk and allow Eloqua to remember the visitor. The cookies placed by the Eloqua server are readable only by Eloqua, and cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on a computer. All web-browsers offer the option to refuse any cookie.  If a visitor refuses the Eloqua cookie, Eloqua does not gather any information on that visitor, but doing so will require you to re-enter certain information at each visit, or prevent us from customizing the site's features according to your preferences. You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive. Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information. We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

**Web Beacons**  
Some Eloqua and customer hosted websites may also use “Web beacon” technologies. When a visitor accesses pages on the Eloqua or a customer’s website with a Web beacon, an anonymous notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our vendors. These Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies to let us know what portions of our Site are of interest to our visitors and to help us provide you with tailored information from our website.  
If you turn off cookies, Web beacon technologies will still detect anonymous visits, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other anonymous information or personally-identifiable information and are disregarded.

**Information Gathered**  
The Eloqua Site will gather information such as what kind of browser visitors are on, what operating system they are using, their IP address, cookie information, time stamp (time page accessed as well as time spent per web page) and their clickstream information (for example, which pages they have viewed and how long they have been there). Note that information is only gathered while the visitor is on the Site. Eloqua monitors how a visitor arrives at the Site, but cannot and will not gather information about other third party sites the user has visited. Eloqua automatically receives and records such information on our server logs from your browser.

In certain sections of the Site, Eloqua may invite you to contact us to pose questions, request information, or complete a registration form. We may ask for Personally Identifiable Information to be entered as a means of registration before accessing a certain part of the Site.

“Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that identifies you personally, including, without limitation, your name, e-mail address, password, login ID and other contact information that you voluntarily submit to us. Visitors of the Site can also choose not to enter any of their Personally Identifiable Information.

Eloqua may also collect Personally Identifiable Information when you use certain Eloqua services, through the use of the Site or hypersite web pages, or when you enter promotions or contests offered by Eloqua on and through the Site.

When you visit the Eloqua Websites, we collect information, including PII that you provide, in order to provide you with the products and services you requested or with offers or promotions that may interest you, service your accounts, and save you time and better respond to your needs.

In the event that you become an Eloqua client, this PII is not transferred to the client install since the marketing activities undertaken therein are wholly separate from the marketing activities undertaken by Eloqua Corporation.

Eloqua's Marketing team may still communicate with you based on your activity on the Eloqua website, however the information will be customer focused, not prospect based. A client's privacy statement within their service hosted in the Eloqua platform will apply to their use of PII. Please consult with our client's privacy policy if you have questions about the client's use of your PII within their service.

If another entity acquires us or all, or substantially all, of our assets, Personally Identifiable Information, non-personal information, and any other information we have collected about the users of our Site may be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets. Also, if any insolvency or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.   
**  
International Issues**  
Our servers are currently located in Canada, which has been deemed by the European Union to provide an equivalent level of privacy protection as that required under the European Union’s Data Protection Directive. Eloqua abides by the Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of Personally Identifiable Information from the European Union. The Safe Harbor Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy principles that Eloqua follows with respect to transfers of personal information from the member states of the European Union (EU) to the United States (US). The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (the "Safe Harbor Principles") to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EU to the United States. The European Union also has recognized the U.S. Safe Harbor as providing adequate data protection (OJ L 45, 15.2.2001, p.47). Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy, Eloqua adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles as well as the EU Data Protection Directive.

**Data Access and Correction**  
If your Personally Identifiable Information changes, or if you no longer desire the services available at our Site, you may correct, update, amend,  or deactivate it by emailing us at [privacy@eloqua.com](mailto:privacy@eloqua.com) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.  We will make commercially reasonable efforts to respond to your request to access within 7-10 business days or sooner.

**Anti-Spam Policy**  
Eloqua has a comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), available at <http://www.eloqua.com/about/AUP> prohibiting the use of our services and servers to send unsolicited commercial email. Eloqua requires ALL its customers to agree adhere to the AUP at all times.  Eloqua continues to actively review and implement new auditing technology such as seedlisting monitoring, complaint monitoring and email failure monitoring to ensure compliance with its AUP. Any violations of the AUP can result in immediate suspension of service or breach of contract

**Customer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews**  
We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our Site which may contain Personally Identifiable Information.  We obtain each customer's consent via email prior to posting the customer name and testimonial.

**Links to Third Party Sites**  
The Site may provide links to other websites or resources over which Eloqua does not have control ("External Web Sites"). Such links do not constitute an endorsement, approval, or recommendation by Eloqua of those External Web Sites. By accessing or using this Site, you acknowledge that Eloqua is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Eloqua is not responsible for the content of such External Web Sites. Your use of External Web Sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the link to External Web Sites.

**Web Monitoring Opt-Out and Anonymity**  
Eloqua believes in permission-based marketing and tracking. Eloqua allows each of its customer websites to give visitors the ability to retain complete anonymity and privacy along with the option not to be engaged by the Eloqua system. If you don't want to be included in the Eloqua or any Eloqua customer website metrics, you can simply opt-out.

**Eloqua Customers**  
Eloqua's services are developed for the use of third party customers. Eloqua requires that all customers using Eloqua services  must comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using Eloqua’s services. Eloqua disclaims all responsibility if a customer chooses to use the Eloqua services to engage in unethical or illegal activities. If a customer is found to have engaged in unethical or illegal activities or found to be in material breach of any Eloqua agreement, Eloqua will suspend the customer’s services immediately and/or may report such activities to the proper authorities. 

**Security**  
Eloqua employs reasonable procedural and technological measures, consistent with standard industry practices, that are designed to help protect your Personally Identifiable Information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. For example, we store the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a username and/or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Our team of security professionals continually monitors and tests our web interface touch-points and implements technology updates in an effort to thwart any attempts for unauthorized intrusion.

If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.

**Best Common Practices**  
Eloqua recommends that anyone using email either through its services or anywhere else should adopt the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG) Sender Best Communications Practices (BCP). With collaborative input from both volume senders and Internet Service Providers, the new best practices recommend sender email technologies and subscription methods to improve deliverability rates for newsletters and permission-based email marketing. The complete Sender Best Communications Practices document is available at the organization’s website at <http://www.maawg.org/about/publishedDocuments>

Eloqua reserves the right to change the terms of this privacy policy at any time in its sole discretion and will post notice of the updated Privacy Policy on our Site located here on this page at <http://www.eloqua.com/about/privacy>/ so you are always aware of what Personally Identifiable Information we may collect and how we may use this information.
