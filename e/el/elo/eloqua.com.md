Privacy Policy

Eloqua believes strongly that every person has the right to privacy.

When using Eloqua Corporation's ("Eloqua") website, located at the URL www.eloqua.com (the "site") and/or services and/or products provided on the Site, you may provide us with personally identifiable information. Eloqua asks for and maintains the personally identifiable information of its visitors and customers to provide a better, more personal experience on the Site and to deliver certain services or information to you. 

Eloqua feels that if a visitor would like a private online experience then they are entitled to one.

Privacy is very important to Eloqua. This Privacy Policy describes the conduct and practices of Eloqua as it applies to our clients and visitors.

Cookies  
Eloqua employs cookies in order for its server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user. Cookies are small text files placed in the 'Cookies' folder on a visitor's hard disk and allow for Eloqua to remember the visitor. The cookies placed by the Eloqua server are readable only by Eloqua, and cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on a computer. All web-browsers offer the option to refuse any cookie, and if a visitor refuses the Eloqua cookie then Eloqua does not gather any information on that visitor, but doing so will require you to re-enter certain information at each visit, or prevent us from customizing the site's features according to your preferences. You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive. Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information  


Information Gathered   
The Eloqua system will gather information such as what kind of browser a visitor is on, what operating system they are using, their IP address, cookie information, time stamp (time page accessed as well as time spent per web page) and their clickstream information (for example, which pages they have viewed and how long they have been there). Note that information is only gathered while the visitor is on the Site. Eloqua monitors how a visitor arrives at the Site, but cannot and will not gather information about other third party sites the user has visited.

Anonymity   
Eloqua allows each of its client sites to give visitors that require complete anonymity and privacy the option to not be engaged by the Eloqua system. Visitors will have the option of removing themselves from availability immediately upon entering the Site by clicking on a privacy button, or when an agent requests a conversation they may opt not to accept. When engaged in an online chat session with an agent, the visitor may end the session at any time.

Eloqua disclaims all responsibility if a client chooses to use the Eloqua services to engage in unethical or illegal activities. If a customer is found to have engaged in unethical or illegal activities or found to be in breach of any of Eloqua’s agreement, Eloqua will suspend the customer’s services immediately and/or may report such activities to the proper authorities.

Security  
Eloqua employs reasonable procedural and technological measures, consistent with standard industry practices that are designed to help protect your Personally Identifiable Information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. For example, we store the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a username and or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Our team of security professionals continually monitors and tests our web interface touch-points and implements technology updates in effort to thwart any attempts for unwanted intrusion.  
If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.  


Best Common Practices  
Eloqua recommends that anyone using email either through its services or anywhere else should adopt the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG) Sender Best Communications Practices (BCP). With collaborative input from both volume senders and Internet Service Providers. The new best practices recommend sender email technologies and subscription methods to improve deliverability rates for newsletters and permission-based email marketing. The complete Sender Best Communications Practices document is available at the organization’s Web site at <http://www.maawg.org/about/publishedDocuments>

Reservation of Rights   
Eloqua reserves the right to change the terms of this privacy policy at any time and will post notice of the updated Privacy Policy on our site located here on this page at <http://www.eloqua.com/about/privacy/> so you are always aware of what Personally Identifiable Information we may collect and how we may use this information. Eloqua may also send registered users of the Site e-mail notifications notifying such users of any changes to the Privacy Policy. Eloqua encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of the Site and/or continued provision of Personally Identifiable Information to use will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.
