Ellucian will provide these companies only with the information they need to deliver the services, and they are contractually prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

At any time, while accessing our Site, any visitor may decline participation in any activity that would require providing information (e.g., survey email, or e-commerce). Your decision not to participate will not affect your ability to use any other feature on our Site.

Ellucian offers you opportunities to engage in blogs, forums, and Twitter and Facebook accounts that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments and postings.
