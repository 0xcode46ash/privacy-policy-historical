# Privacy Policy | Ellucian

Ellucian respects your privacy and recognizes the importance of your personal information. We are committed to protecting your information through our compliance with this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information we may collect through your use of our website (our “Site”). By using our Site, you consent to our collection and use of the information described in this Privacy Policy.

### Collection and Use of Information

Ellucian will only collect your personal information (such as your name, address, or telephone number) if you provide it to us voluntarily. 

In addition, we automatically collect certain information regarding visitors to our Site, including information about your equipment, browsing actions and usage patterns. The information we collect automatically is statistical data and does not include personal information. We use this information solely for internal purposes, such as to improve our Site.

The technologies we use for this automatic data collection include cookies. A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You have the ability to delete cookie files from your hard drive at any time or avoid cookies by configuring your browser to reject them or to notify you when a cookie is being placed on your hard drive.

Ellucian, on its own or through third-party vendors, occasionally uses first-party and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize and serve ads based on your past visits to our Site. The techniques Ellucian’s third-party vendors employ do not collect any personal information. You can visit this [page](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ "page") and this [page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ "page") to opt out of this advertising.

Our Site uses Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to help us understand, in aggregate, the age, gender and interests of Site visitors. This Google Analytics tool does not reveal to Ellucian your name or other identifying information. Ellucian does not combine the information collected through use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. The information received from Google Analytics is used only to improve our Site and the type of information displayed to Site visitors so we can better serve those interested in Ellucian. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to our Site by using Google Analytics’ Opt-out Browser Add-on, available on this [page](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

Ellucian occasionally hires other companies to provide services on our behalf, for example, to process event registrations. Ellucian will provide these companies only with the information they need to deliver the services, and they are contractually prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

At any time, while accessing our Site, any visitor may decline participation in any activity that would require providing information (e.g., survey email, or e-commerce). Your decision not to participate will not affect your ability to use any other feature on our Site.

Ellucian offers you opportunities to engage in blogs, forums, and Twitter and Facebook accounts that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments and postings. You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you choose to submit via those media can be read, collected, and used by other participants and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit when you engage in such activities.

Ellucian’s products and services are not intended for children under the age of 13. Ellucian does not knowingly collect any information from children. If we learn that we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.

### Security

Ellucian has implemented a number of security features to help prevent the unauthorized release of or access to personal information. Although Ellucian has endeavored to create a secure and reliable Site for you, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from Ellucian via the Site or email cannot be guaranteed.
