### How We Collect Information on the Website

When you visit and interact with the Website, independently of your use of any Ellie Mae product or service, our web server uses cookies to improve your interaction with the Website by, for example, expediting load times for individual pages or remembering your preferences and settings. What are cookies? Cookies are files that web servers place on an Internet user’s computer. They are designed to store basic information about the user and transmit that information back to servers that recognize them. They may be used to measure visitor behavior on and in connection with a website. There are two main types of cookies: session and persistent. Session cookies exist only during an Internet user’s online session. They disappear from the user’s computer when he/she closes the browser software. Persistent cookies may remain on the user’s computer after the browser has been closed and resume interaction with the server when the user returns to a website. Depending on which browser you use to access the internet (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, etc.), you can change your settings to affect whether to accept, store or delete cookies, but doing so may impact you ability to navigate our site and use our products. How does Ellie Mae use cookies? We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. The cookies used on the Website do not identify you personally by default. They merely recognize your browser, unless you choose to identify yourself voluntarily, which you may do by asking the browser to remember your username and password, for example. They transmit information to us about your browsing choices, such as which hyperlink you followed to arrive at the Website, which we in turn use to optimize your browsing experience. In some cases, third party software products, such as Google analytics, are used help us optimize our website’s performance, and that third party software may access these cookies and use the information contained in such cookies to help us do so. If you are logged in to our services or are a returning site visitor and therefore a potential customer, we use persistent cookies to, among other things, (1) track your use of our software, (2) authenticate your login to our software products and (3) maintain the preferences you have chosen. We encourage you to reference the Privacy Policy applicable to each of our products in order to understand how they use cookies. What are Web Beacons and how does Ellie Mae use them? We may also use web beacons, which are transparent graphic images on a webpage or within the body of one of our marketing emails, to allow us to measure visitor actions and assess the effectiveness of our website or email marketing campaign. For example, we use web beacons in our email marketing to track instances where a user clicks through a link in the email.

### How We Use Information Collected at the EllieMae.com Website

We may use Personal Information you provide during a support contact, independently or in association with cookies we have placed on your machine (in the case of contact directly through the Website), to, among other things, provide you with offers for Ellie Mae products and services which may be of interest to you via direct email marketing or to facilitate the log in process for online services like the Resource Center. You may opt-out of receiving such offers at any time by following the steps to “unsubscribe” described in the footer of our marketing emails. Your opt-out will become effective in 10 days or less. We may share Personal Information gathered on our Website through cookies or web beacons independently from your use of any Ellie Mae product or service with third parties to provide services on our behalf, including marketing assistance, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service and data analysis. We require third party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed to them. Third parties who provide services for us are not permitted to use information we share that might identify you for any purpose other than to provide services to Ellie Mae or to you. We may disclose any information, including Personal Information, we deem necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to enforce our rights or protect the safety and security of our Website or other users. In the event we undergo a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or a sale of all or a portion of our assets, we may transfer information about you contained in our physical records or on our servers to the intended successor organization in such transaction. If material changes to our privacy practices will occur as a result of the business transition, we will post a notice on the Website alerting you to the business transition.

### Information collected at Appraisal Center, Title Center and Loan Center

If you are a service provider who wishes to transact with other Ellie Mae customers you may use segments of our website designed for service providers. When you register or login at one of these service center homepages, such as Appraisal Center at appraisalcenter.elliemae.com, we collect and process some information in addition to what is described above. At each homepage, you may login or register to view requests for your services sent by Encompass users. When you login or register, we collect the login ID and password you use to ascertain your identity and display the proper orders to you. Either when you register or during your subscription to Ellie Mae services, we will also collect credit card information you input or share for billing purposes. If you choose to create a marketing page for others to view within Encompass, we will store the information you provide for that page on our servers to enable Encompass users to access and view your page. This collection, use and storage of data is in addition to that described above for our Website generally. Our Policies Concerning Children This Website is intended for the use of adults over the age of 18 with an interest in Ellie Mae’s software services, which relate to the residential real estate market. As such, it is obviously not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from such persons. Individuals who are under the age of 18 should not use our Website or our online services at any time. In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently gathered Personal Information from children under the age of 13, we will use reasonable efforts to erase such information from our records. Privacy Policies of Linked Sites and Advertisers Our Website may contain links to other sites, as well as advertisements from companies linking to their own sites. These other sites may not have privacy policies, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. If you have any questions about how these other sites use your information, you should contact them directly. Security Ellie Mae has physical, administrative and technical measures in place to maintain the security, confidentiality and integrity of the data gathered through the Ellie Mae Website, and to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of such data. For example, when you access the Website, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that the data is safe, secure and available only to us. Our employees may access information stored on our servers with proper credentials during the normal course of our business in order to administer, test and secure the servers hosting such information. However, while we take reasonable steps to protect your personal information against security breaches and unauthorized access, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure and therefore we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you send to us. You send any information via the Website at your own risk.
