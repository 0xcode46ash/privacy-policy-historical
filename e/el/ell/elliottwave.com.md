# EWI Privacy Policy

**EWI Privacy Policy**

EWI wants to provide you with a rewarding, informative and exciting visit to our website and to safeguard your privacy online.

Here is our policy on privacy issues. Be sure to check back as these guidelines may change on occasion to reflect new services.

**Spam **

EWI does not distribute unsolicited bulk advertising via email (spam). Also, we do not share email addresses with outside companies. Any email address provided by the visitor is kept strictly confidential. We conform to all state and federal laws regarding this issue.

**Email Communications**

_Club EWI:_ Visitors to our site may sign up for Club EWI, a free content service. We publish new content on a regular basis for all members. The information we collect from members when they sign up is kept strictly confidential. Members may opt out of the Club at any time; instructions are clearly communicated in each email we send.

_Former subscribers:_ We occasionally send emails to former subscribers. Most of these emails announce free content and other resources. Sometimes we send notices that the markets have reached a critical juncture and invite former subscribers to take another look at our services. Former subscribers may ask to have their email addresses removed from our database at any time. 

_Opt-in Notification Services:_ On numerous sections of our website visitors may request that content pieces and updates be emailed to them. EWI intends that any of the notification programs (Market Watch, Market Report, Global Wrap, Street Sweep, for example) do not result in undesired email to subscribers. EWI uses the email addresses solely for notification, with the exception that we occasionally announce the availability of other high-value content or special events we feel notification-content subscribers will be interested in. Subscribers may opt out of the programs at any time. Instructions for opting out are clearly communicated on every email message.

**Tracking of Personal Information**

We do not gather information about individuals reviewing our services without first gaining their permission. Any data we obtain is used for the purpose of exposing visitors to other relevant services that we feel could be complementary or an even better fit than the one currently utilized. We are committed to protecting all of the personal information that we collect and do not distribute this information to other companies.

  * IP- Internet Protocol Address
  * ISP- Internet Service Provider
  * Browser type and version
  * Operating system

**Security**

We use a secure server and take precautions to secure the information provided to us. However, we cannot guarantee the security of any information as it is transferred over the Internet, so please understand that you do so at your own risk.
