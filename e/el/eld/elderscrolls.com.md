**What types of information does ZeniMax collect and how will it be used?**  
In order to give you the best experience on our site, ZeniMax may collect information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Typically, we may ask a user to submit personal and/or demographic information, and it will usually take the form of either: (1) product and warranty registration; (2) community forum registration; (3) contests and sweepstakes, (4) technical support; (5) the purchase of a product or service at our online store; and (6) personal information submitted in a business capacity (e.g., resumes). The types of information that may be requested for each activity and the way the information may be used are detailed below. In the event that demographic information is requested on the same page as personal information, the demographic and personal information may be combined.

  * _Product and Warranty Registration_

  
To register on our site, we may ask you to provide personal information such as your name, email address, home address, and telephone number. We may also collect demographic information including your age, information about the product you purchased, the type of console you own, and the types of games you enjoy playing. The information that you submit during registration will entitle you to limited warranty protection and technical support. We may also use your registration information to notify you about updates to our products and services.

  * _Forum Registration_

To register for membership in any of our online community forums, we may ask you to provide personal information such as your email address, and to create a username and password. We may also collect demographic information about you, including your occupation, hobbies and interest, and other preferences. The information that you submit to us for this purpose is used to give you access to our community forums and other community features and to allow the moderators and administrators of the message board to contact you.
