# ElderCarelink â€” Privacy policy regarding searches for assisted living, home care, nursing home, and elder care providers.

Updated May 4, 2009

If you have questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please see our contact details at the end of this document.

_ElderCare_ link, a division of QuinStreet, Inc. (" _ElderCare_ link"), has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to safeguarding the privacy of your personal information. _ElderCare_ link is not a covered entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, often referred to as HIPAA. However, we value your privacy and we will collect and use information through the ElderCarelink.com website (the "Site") only in the ways disclosed in this statement. This statement applies solely to information collected through the Site.

_ElderCare_ link collects information through the Site at several points and in several ways.

Personally Identifiable Information Collected

We collect personal information that Users furnish to us through the Site on a voluntary basis. The Site is designed to match providers of services who are clients of _ElderCare_ link ("Providers") with individuals who need services like those furnished by the Providers ("Users"). We collect User-submitted information such as Email, Name, Address, and Phone Number and other information as to User-requested services. This information is collected and used by _ElderCare_ link in the operation of the Site, including submission of User information to prospective Providers. Although we inform Providers of the confidential nature of information sent to them using the Site, we cannot control or be responsible for how such Providers may use such information once it is received. If you provide personally identifiable data to us, you may later elect to have your information deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the opt-out procedures set forth below. Our Site may offer forums, chats or message boards. Please be advised that information posted in these venues becomes public knowledge and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. Any information posted on a forum, chat or message board is subject to our Terms of Use. If you choose to submit, post or transmit information through a forum, chat or message board, _ElderCare_ link will collect the information as provided by you. _ElderCare_ link retains this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law and pursuant to our Terms of Use.

Non-Identifiable Information Collected

Like most standard website servers, we gather information automatically from your browser or Internet session and store it in log files. This information includes your internet protocol (IP) address, the browser type that you are using, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform or operating system on your computer, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We use this non-personally identifiable information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement in aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information. We use third party software to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information. These vendors collect information such as your IP address and do not allow us to identify you personally. We do not share this non-identifiable information. We use cookies. A cookie is a small text file that our Web server places on a User's computer hard drive to be a unique identifier. Cookies enable _ElderCare_ link to track usage patterns and deliver customized content to Users. Our cookies do not have an expiration date. Our cookies do not collect personally identifiable information. Some of our business partners use cookies on our Site (for example, advertisers). We have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. You may disable or reject cookies if your browser permits. Please be advised that this may prevent you from accessing certain features of the Site. We use registration pages and contact forms to collect personal data and traffic logs to determine site statistics and to collect non-identifiable data.

Use of Personally Identifiable Information

Certain of the information collected by _ElderCare_ link will be used for marketing and customer service purposes. In addition to our referral arrangements with our Providers, we also have marketing arrangements with certain other Providers that are either: (i) engaged in health care-related activities (other than general eldercare products and services); or (ii) marketing services and products that are useful to seniors and/or their families (such as medical treatment or research of a particular disease or condition). From time-to-time, we may send you information about products or services that are offered by these other Providers that we believe you may be interested in based on the information you provided in the _ElderCare_ link Consumer Needs Survey. For example, if you indicated to us that the care recipient has Arthritis, we may notify you about a company that offers Arthritis treatment or that is engaged in a clinical study of Arthritis. However, we will not forward your information to these other Providers unless you explicitly authorize us to do so. You may decide whether or not you want to authorize us to forward to such Provider(s) the information you provided in the _ElderCare_ link Consumer Needs Survey so that you can receive information about these products or services directly from the Provider, which may include email, direct mail, and/or a phone call as well as access to premium content. Registered Users may also receive additional announcements from us about products, services, special deals and a newsletter. In addition, personal information may be combined with information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to your preferences and behaviors, and for other sales and marketing efforts of _ElderCare_ link. The information we collect may be used to create customer profiles based on browsing or purchasing history. We may supplement information collected at our Site with data from other sources. We employ commercially reasonable efforts to protect the information furnished to us by Users from unauthorized use by third parties. However, in no event will the information provided by Users be deemed confidential or result in any liability to you on our part if such information is inadvertently released by us or accessed by third parties without our consent.

Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information

The non-personally identifiable information that we collect is used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content in an effort to create a more personally relevant experience and to evaluate the effectiveness of Internet properties. The information is also used to predict responses to advertisements and to help determine which ads perform best, which content is most appropriate for different individuals, how our visitors use the Site, and which pages and features are most popular.

This Site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by _ElderCare_ link. _ElderCare_ link is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by _ElderCare_ link.

We may also disclose information to an affiliate or third party who provides substantially similar services as the original service about which you requested more information. In such situations, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing.

We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
