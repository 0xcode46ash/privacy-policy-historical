The only information which may be disclosed in print form or online without prior notice of your consent is directory information which is defined as name, address, dates of attendance, major, degrees, awards, honors, and weight and height of athletes. For complete information, see the [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act](https://web.archive.org/students.aspx?id=918 "Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act").
  2. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), which generally safeguards the integrity and confidentiality of health information that is transmitted electronically.
  3. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB), which generally safeguards nonpublic, personal information, in electronic or paper form associated with customers of ECC’s financial services and products.
  4. The Illinois Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). As a state institution, ECC may be legally required under this act or other laws to provide specific information, such as some electronic correspondence sent via the ECC Web site.
