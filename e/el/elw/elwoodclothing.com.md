### Information We Collect

#### Our visitors - Automatic Data Collection

Like most websites,Elwood.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use this website. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of this website.

Elwood also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We do not use such information to identify our visitors, however, and do not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that we use and disclose personally-identifying information, as described below.

#### Our customers - Information You Provide to Us

Certain actions on our website do require us to collect personally-indentifying information. Purchasers are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process transactions. In each case, Elwood collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with our company.
