The Internet is rapidly changing the way all of us communicate and interact with each other. While the Internet allows each of us access to a greater array of information and services than has ever been available; these new online activities do raise new challenges, such as the privacy issues addressed in this policy. ViaTech, Inc. is committed to enforcing strong electronic privacy that is crucial for the ongoing success of the Internet as a service, commercial, and entertainment medium. But most importantly, having a relationship with our customers that is founded on trust is not only essential for our continued success, but it is extremely important to us. Any feedback you'd like to provide to help us better meet your expectations in this arena is welcome. Please feel free to send your feed back to: [webmaster@elicense.com](mailto:webmaster@elicense.com)

**Our Commitment to You:**  
ViaTech, Inc. wants to make your online experience satisfying and safe. We pledge that ViaTech will not release your personal data to anyone else without your consent - period. 

You may change the status of whether you wish to receive offers and communications at any time from ViaTech. 

When we do present information to our advertisers, unless you tell us otherwise, it is in the form of aggregate statistics compiled among all of our visitors' data collected. 

ViaTech collects information online primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our site and services. Depending on the service you are accessing, you could be asked at various times to provide information such as your name, email address, or information about what you like and do not like. On other occasions such as when we provide items for purchase online, we may request your credit card number to conclude the transaction and your mailing address to ensure proper delivery. We request this information to provide our strongest value to you - outstanding customer service. 

Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable:  


  1. **Anonymous Information** refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that 10,000 people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of birth. What we collect from transactions such as this constitutes anonymous information, much like how your hometown's bus service knows how many people take a given route - but doesn't necessarily know who those people are. Many of the individuals who access our services decline to use the option to receive email from us in the registration page, and therefore those individuals are anonymous to us and the data we collect is similarly anonymous information.
  2. **Personally Identifiable Information** refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, phone number, or billing/shipping address, and possibly credit card information. In many cases we need this information to process an order that you have requested, or email information to you per your request. Those requests may include, but are not limited to, support questions, product updates, or future promotions.



**How the Information is Used:**  
When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Netscape Navigator® or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits information to ViaTech every time you access content on our site. Examples of such information include the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from ibm.com or yale.edu), URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version and platform type (e.g. Netscape on a Windows platform) you are using to access our site. All of this information is collected by ViaTech and is used to help improve our offerings to you. 

In addition to collecting these types of information, our search engine, collects aggregate search terms for internal reporting and targeted advertising. The ViaTech Web site collects visitor information for purposes of product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted advertising. 

We also count, track, and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the ViaTech properties, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about you into group data, which may then be shared, on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but ViaTech will not disclose your individual identity or personal data without your permission. When ViaTech does present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you. 

**With Whom is This Information Shared?**   
ViaTech does not share personally identifiable information except during the processing of some requests for information or services. In this case, information may (but will not necessarily) be referred to one of ViaTech's service partners who will be able to assist in the processing of that request. Any partner or off-site assistant will be required not to disclose personally identifiable information to others and not to share that information with marketers. Site users can opt out of having their request referred to an outside partner by checking a box on the order confirmation form. 

ViaTech is a supporter of the TRUSTe program (a global initiative for establishing consumer trust and confidence in electronic transactions by protecting on line privacy via industry-standard online privacy policy disclosure.) Under no circumstances does ViaTech compile "audit trails" of which users are browsing what pages, and under no circumstances will ViaTech sell, rent, loan or give personally identifiable user information to marketers. 

ViaTech does not monitor private communications (e.g. email) at all, much less make any use of such communications. ViaTech does not display or make available users' or members' personal information, such as contact information, even if it is already publicly available. 

**Security**  
ViaTech uses all available security measures to protect both personally identifiable information & anonymous information collected from this web site. 

**Opt-out Policy**  
ViaTech allows users to opt-out of receiving further communications by "unchecking" a check-box on the Registration Page, or by replying to e-mail and putting "unsubscribe" in the subject field. Alternatively, any user who wishes to opt-out of receiving further communications can send an email to webmaster@elicense.com and request that they be removed from our mailing list. 

**Correct/Update Policy**  
ViaTech allows users to correct or update their information by contacting their account representative. Alternatively, any user who wishes to update their information can send an email to [webmaster@elicense.com](mailto:webmaster@elicense.com) and provide their corrected information. 

**Delete/Deactivate Policy**  
This site does not offer a way to delete your information from our database. If you request that your information is no longer be used, your request will be processed & honored. 

**Links to other sites**  
This site contains links to other sites. ViaTech is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites, as their Privacy Policy may differ from ours.
