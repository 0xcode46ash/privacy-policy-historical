# Privacy Policy - www.elitesingles.ie

####  With Registration

If you want to use the services of ELITESINGLES described in detail in the ELITESINGLES Terms and Conditions, we need a number of personal information from you in order to provide the desired service.

We only use the personal data that you actively provide us (e.g. contact information for the registration, profile information or photos). In many cases, you can decide which data and information you reveal about yourself in the context of profiling and / or search. Data that are strictly necessary for the provision of the contract are always marked separately as required (e.g. email address) so that you know what data you need to enter for the use of the service and what you can do without.

For more detailed information please see below. To learn more about the exact procedure and the method of matchmaking, please note our detailed information in the ELITESINGLES Help page.

  1. **With the free registration you will be prompted to provide the following details without which a registration cannot be completed:**


  * Gender
  * Gender of the partner you are seeking
  * Email address
  * Password


  1. Our scientific personality test follows after registration. First, we ask for the following information to identify suitable partners:


  * Postcode
  * Date of birth
  * Size
  * Marital Status
  * Education
  * Occupation
  * Income



Furthermore, you are asked in the test to answer a series of personal questions (e.g. information on preferences, personal characteristics and desires for a partner), which are the basis of our matching service and the basis for your ELITESINGLES profile.

bb) If you purchase an ELITESINGLES Paid Membership, the following data are collected during the payment process:

•    First and Last Name  
•    Bank account details or credit card information  
•    Home address

cc) To log in on ELITESINGLES you use your specified e-mail address and your chosen password. During every visit to the ELITESINGLES service, utilisation data are forwarded by your Internet browser and stored in log files called Server Log Files. These data are:

•    IP address (Internet Protocol address) of the accessing computer  
•    User ID on the ELITESINGLES platform  
•    Name of the page  
•    Date and time of access  
•    The referrer URL from which you came to the requested page  
•    Amount of data transferred  
•    Status indication whether download was successful  
•    Session Cookies  
•    Session identification number

These data will be evaluated anonymously by us for statistical purposes.

dd) The use of personal data for the provision of the ELITESINGLES service:

The collection of personal data at ELITESINGLES is done principally with the aim of giving the customer a safe, smooth, efficient, and personal use of the ELITESINGLES service. The data are therefore used to provide the services requested and desired by the customer. However, they also serve to detect and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and for the enforcement of the Terms and Conditions and the contract.

In the following, the use of personal data is described in more detail:

•    Other members can see your profile information and entries on the ELITESINGLES page. Premium and Premium Plus members can also see the photos you upload on ELITESINGLES.  
•    Your profile - and thus your profile information and uploaded photos - is suggested to other members as part of our matching method. The matching can be switched off in your account. When switched off, your profile will not be suggested to any other members and at the same time you do not get any partner suggestions.  
•    Other members can see when you visit their profile page. Conversely, you can also see which members have visited your profile. This is an essential element of the contact between members. In general it is an important part of the services of social networking sites, and thus the service of ELITESINGLES. Therefore, this cannot be turned off via the user account.  
•    Other members can send you messages. However, at no point does ELITESINGLES give out your e-mail address. Messages are only sent through your ELITESINGLES mailbox. You can always "block" undesirables if you want to make it so they can no longer contact you.  
•    Email notifications: ELITESINGLES sends various notifications on every registered user.  
In the context of customer relationship and customer service messages we will inform you if, for example, other members have visited your profile, you have been sent a message, been smiled at or if there are new members that fit your search criteria. You can always disable these service messages on your user account under message options.  
We also send you ELITESINGLES information and special offers, such as tips and useful information about the partner search, surveys and special offers for your ELITESINGLES membership. You can disable the ELITESINGLES info and special offers messages with your user account under message options.  
Information messages pertaining to the service, such as the confirmation of customer service and information on the release of images and texts, and on the conclusion of a paid membership, in the form of contract documents, payment processing information, etc., are part of our service and therefore cannot be cancelled.  
We would also like to inform you via e-mail about ELITESINGLES Partner offers and events. To protect you and ELITESINGLES from abuse, we introduce in this newsletter, the so-called "double opt-in" procedure, i.e. you only receive the newsletter, if you have ordered it by e-mail or in your user account and confirmed your email address. You can unsubscribe at any time by deactivating this either in the message options, or by following the unsubscribe process in the newsletter.  
If you change your message options, it can take up to 48 hours before it is active. Nevertheless, depending on the message options, the cancellation is still successful, and after this period you will receive no additional messages from us.  
•    ELITESINGLES sets a filter to protect users from unsolicited mail. For example, automatic filters prevent the sending of messages with certain pay numbers or certain inappropriate keywords.  
•    Identity Verification: Premium Plus members can send a copy of their identity card by e-mail, fax or post, along with their additional security code to us. Our customer care then checks whether certain information (e.g. date of birth) coincide with the date of birth on the identity card displayed on the website. Upon successful identity verification, the profile is marked with a symbol. ELITESINGLES does not store the ID copies and destroys them after identity verification.  
•    "Like" feature: Under the photos and entries of other profiles there is a “Like" button that can be clicked. With the "Like" function, you can express that you like statements or pictures in the profile of another member with one click. As a consequence, the other member is notified. In your own profile you can see how many members like a particular text field or photo of you. You can also see which members have clicked "Like" on a certain profile element.  
•    “Message Read”: Premium Plus members can use this function to detect whether their messages have been clicked on by the recipient. When a message is clicked by the recipient, the sender gets a message about the time it was accessed. You can disable this feature allows in the user account.  
•    Import photos from Facebook: If you have a user profile on Facebook, you can transfer photos from this profile to your ELITESINGLES profile. To do this you must click on the appropriately labeled button to connect to Facebook and log in there with your Facebook user data. After successful login a window will appear were all your Facebook user account pictures are stored. You can select up to 24 photos and import them into your ELITESINGLES profile.  
•    Personality Profile: In order to find suitable partners among other ELITESINGLES members, an individual personality profile is created for each ELITESINGLES member using the answers given in the ELITESINGLES personality test. You can find this personality profile in your profile as a separate menu item. It can be seen both by yourself, as well as by other members. It covers five major dimensions of your personality and, in addition, three related sub-dimensions ("facets"). Basic and Premium Members only see the results of the main dimensions.

For additional information about the expiration of the service in general, and answers to other questions about ELITESINGLES, see our detailed descriptions on the ELITESINGLES Help page.

c.    Data Transfer to Third Parties

When we transmit data in the framework of the provision of the service to other members, this is only in connection with the user name you choose. Under no circumstances do we share with other members direct contact information (such as your name, your address, or your e-mail address). Communication at ELITESINGLES is exclusively done via your internal mailbox so that you can decide for yourself to whom you disclose your contact details. Some data that you specified when creating your ELITESINGLES profile are always visible to other registered users. These data include age, gender, height, ethnicity, religion, occupation, smoking habits and children.

You can decide on the settings on your account, whether you want to continue to have your profile suggested to other members through our matching process.

Personal data will only be passed on to third parties if necessary to provide the service offered (e.g. payment processing for fee-based memberships), and if you have given us your consent or disclosure in accordance with relevant statutory provisions that are required or permitted (e.g. if we have to comply with a request, a governmental investigative or security agency). An overview of possible third parties resulting is available in our Public Register.

In addition to internal ELITESINGLES checks, outsourced partners including Apollo Solutions Ltd., Informatics Park, La Tour Koenig, Pointe aux Sables and Mauritius ("Apollo Solutions") also check uploaded photos of ELITESINGLES members for authenticity to ensure a high quality of service and to protect our members from scammers.

Since the data protection laws outside the EU are generally less severe than in the EU, Apollo Solutions transfers personal data to processors approved by the EU Commission who have standard contractual clauses and are obliged to take all necessary measures to protect personal data according to EU standards. The protection of your personal data is thus completely ensured.

d.    Use of Cookies

ELITESINGLES uses "cookies" to make your interaction with the platform individually identifiable and optimised. A cookie is a text file that is either stored temporarily in the computer's memory ("session cookies") or saved on the hard drive ("permanent cookie"). Cookies contain e.g. Information about your previous requests to the appropriate server or information on what offers have been made so far. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. The main purpose of cookies is to provide a tailor-made offer and make the use of the Service as comfortable as possible.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. However, you can configure your browser so that it rejects or requests you to confirm the acceptance of cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, however, this may have the consequence that not all of our offerings are available to you.

ELITESINGLES uses session cookies, partner and affiliate cookies and permanent cookies.  
•    Session Cookies: ELITESINGLES mostly uses "session cookies", which are not stored on your hard drive and are deleted when the browser is closed. Session cookies are used for login authentication and to balance the system load.  
•    Partner and Affiliate Cookies: ELITESINGLES use these cookies if you access our services via an external advertising space. These cookies are used to settle accounts with the cooperation partners and do not contain personal information from you.  
•    Permanent cookies: ELITESINGLES uses "permanent cookies" to save your personal use settings. This allows for personalisation and improves the ELITESINGLES service, because you are able to find your personal settings again on subsequent visits.  
e.    Use of Analysis Programs and Remarketing

ELITESINGLES performs analyses of the behaviour of members and of how members use the service. We also create anonymous user profiles and test their quality in order to improve our services to you. For usage data and other metrics we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"), but with the extension "_anonymizeIp ()". Here the IP addresses are abbreviated, which avoids a direct personal reference.

Google Analytics uses cookies, i.e. text files, which are stored on your computer and allow an analysis of how you use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing others with website and internet related services. Google may also transfer this information to third parties unless required by law or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. In this case however, you may not be able to use all features of the ELITESINGLES website. By using the ELITESINGLES site, you agree to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner described above and for the aforementioned purpose.

You can object to the collection and analysis of your use of ELITESINGLES services by Google Analytics. Please use the Browser Add-On to deactivate Google Analytics.

ELITESINGLES uses Google’s Remarketing technology. Using this technology, internet users who have already visited the site, or shown an interest in ELITESINGLES, can be addressed again by targeted advertising on Google’s Partner Network sites. The deployment of advertising is done through the use of cookies, which are small text files that are stored on the user's computer. Using the text files the user behaviour can be analysed when you visit the site and then used for targeted product recommendations and interest-based advertising.

If you do not wish to receive interest-based advertising, you can disable the use of cookies by Google for these purposes on the deactivation page for DoubleClick. Alternatively, users can disable the use of third party cookies by visiting the deactivation page of the Network Advertising Initiative.

Further information on Google’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy can be found at http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html or  
http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html

In addition, from time to time we also use analysis programs from other providers to use the knowledge gained to tailor the offer and for advertising and marketing purposes. This is, of course, all done in the context of anonymous or pseudonymous legal guidelines. We do not use your personal information for these analyses.  
f.    Use of Facebook Social Plugins

ELITESINGLES uses social plugins ("plugins") provided by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). These plugins are identified by a Facebook logo. If you use a social plugin on an ELITESINGLES site, your browser establishes a direct connection with the Facebook servers. Facebook then transmits the plugin content to your browser, and then integrates it into the website.

Thereby Facebook obtains the information that you have accessed on the corresponding ELITESINGLES page. If you are logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the ELITESINGLES visit to your Facebook account. If you interact with the Facebook plugins (e.g. press the "Like" button), the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser to Facebook and stored there. For the purpose and scope of data collection and the further processing and use of data by Facebook, and your rights in this respect and settings options for protecting your privacy, please refer to the privacy policies of Facebook.

If you do not want Facebook to collect data of this kind, we recommend that you log out before your visit ELITESINGLES on Facebook.

g.    Use of Google+ Social Plugins

Our website uses social plugins ("plugins") provided by the social network plus.google.com, which is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). The plugins are marked with a Google logo, the Google +1 logo or the phrase "Google Social Plugin". When you visit a page of our website that contains a social plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Google servers. The content of the plugin is sent from Google directly to your browser, and is then embedded into the ELITESINGLES website. When integrating the plugin, Google is informed that you have accessed the corresponding page of our website.

If you are logged in to Google, Google can assign your visit to your Google Account. If you interact with the plugins, for example the "+1" button, or leave a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Google and stored there. For the purpose and scope of data collection and the further processing and use of data by Google as well as your rights in this respect and settings options for protecting your privacy, please visit the privacy policies of Google.

If you do not want Google to collect information about you via our website, you must log out on Google before you visit our website.

h.    Use of Twitter Social Plugins

Our website uses social plugins ("plugins") provided by the social network twitter.com, operated by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. If you use the re-tweet capabilities, the websites you visit will be disclosed to third parties and linked to your Twitter account. For further details to do with the use of your data through Twitter, as well as your rights and options for protecting your personal data, please refer to the privacy policies of Twitter.

i.    Checking and verification of personal data

In order to protect our customers from people who abuse the ELITESINGLES service, we analyse the platform and consider customer input for plausibility using various automated monitoring tools in addition to the internal monitoring done by our customer care agents. However, ELITESINGLES does not assume responsibility or a legal obligation in doing this. Also, certain character string or logins of different members, for example, those which originate from the same computer, can result in the blocking of suspicious activity.

ELITESINGLES reserves the right to enforce an automated filtering of messages. Here certain word lists and personally written texts are checked for their compliance with our terms and conditions. For example pornographic or offensive words and texts are automatically matched with customers and blocked. We also try to protect our members from scammers by undertaking anti-scamming checks.

Should a suspicion of abuse of the ELITESINGLES service arise from these checks, the legal consequences for members are listed in the general Terms and Conditions. ELITESINGLES can also prevent the acceptance and delivery of incoming and outgoing messages, if there is high probability that it is a message containing any illegal and / or content in defiance to the terms and conditions. A notice of rejected or non-delivered messages is not carried out.
