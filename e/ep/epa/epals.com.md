**EFFECTIVE DATE:**  June 22, 2015, Last Updated Date: January 28, 2016  
 

#### PURPOSE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY:

This privacy policy addresses the online privacy practices of Cricket Media, Inc., formerly known as ePals, Inc., and its affiliated entities, including its subsidiary, Carus Publishing Company, for the website services and/or products indicated herein (“Cricket”). Cricket is committed to protecting the privacy of children, students, parents, and educators, while providing students and schools with a dynamic learning and teaching environment made possible by the Internet and made available through its ePals® global learning community (hereinafter “ePals).  
 

The cricketmedia.com site includes an e-commerce section at [shop.cricketmedia.com](http://shop.cricketmedia.com/) for conducting sales of Cricket magazine subscriptions and products to customers 18 years of age or older, where customer accounts may be established. This e-commerce section is intended for use by visitors 18 years of age or older. By ordering a Product from at [shop.cricketmedia.com](http://shop.cricketmedia.com/), a customer is representing himself or herself as 18 years of age or older.  
 

This Privacy Policy explains how Cricket collects and uses information from Users of its websites, products and services, including ePals, Challenges and/or similar contests involving or related to ePals or Cricket’s magazines, and in2Books (collectively, “Services”), and in connection with its sale of Cricket’s magazine subscriptions and related products (collectively “Products”), including our treatment of personally identifiable information.  
 

If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), you may only use the Services and disclose information to us with your parent’s (or guardian’s) express consent. Review this Privacy Policy with your parent (or guardian). (We recommend that you do the same with the privacy policies of all websites you visit or mobile applications you use). You may only order Products if you are 18 years of age or older, and have a valid credit card to purchase.  
 

##### This policy does not apply to websites, offerings or practices of companies that Cricket does not own or control.

#### IF YOU USE THE SERVICES, THE PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES TO YOU.

As you will see from reviewing this Privacy Policy, we take your privacy seriously. By accessing or using the Services (including via mobile devices) or accessing [shop.cricketmedia.com](http://shop.cricketmedia.com/) and ordering Products, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.

#### USERS UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTEEN ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY:

This Privacy Policy covers all users and is applicable to all of the Services and Product purchases. The Privacy Policy is divided into several sections. Section I specifically addresses information collected from users of the Services who are under 13 years of age; Section II specifically addresses information collected from individuals 13 years of age and older, and addresses information collected in connection with the e-commerce section, [shop.cricketmedia.com](http://shop.cricketmedia.com/), for users 18 years of age and older in connection with ordering Products.  
 

When we use the term “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are referring to personally identifiable information. When we refer to “Child Related Personal Information,” we mean personally identifiable information of minors (i.e. persons under the age of 18). General references to “information” are to information that does not and could not reasonably be used by us to identify an individual.  
 

#### I. PRIVACY NOTICE FOR CHILDREN UNDER 13

Cricket limits the collection of personal information from children to only that which is necessary to obtain parental consent or to participate in a Cricket program or activity after we have obtained parental consent. If you are under age 13, you are not allowed to subscribe to any of the Services or create an account without the permission of your parent, guardian, or teacher. In addition to the required consent, it is a good idea to request assistance from your parent or legal guardian in setting up your account, or your teacher with respect to setting up your account for ePals®.  
 

##### Parental Consent (and Teacher and Guardian Consent)

We require a parent or guardian to consent before a child under the age of 13 can become a member of Cricket or to use any of the Services. In addition, during any such registration process, we only collect limited personal information (i.e., parent’s name and email address) for the purposes of obtaining a parent’s permission for his/her child to participate in the particular Service or become a member of Cricket.  
 

For some Cricket Services, such as ePals®, teachers and school administrators may provide consent on behalf of parents. As a parent, you should consult your school’s acceptable use policy for more information about your child’s school’s policies and practices for protecting children on the Internet. As a teacher or school administrator, you should confirm that you have authority to consent on behalf of your student’s parents, by reviewing your school’s acceptable use policy and any express consents provided by parents or guardians to students’ online activities, together with Cricket’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.  
 

Parents can provide consent by email, fax, or postal mail for their children to use ePals®.  Complete email instructions are provided in the parental consent form available at the following link: [Consent Form Link](http://en.community.epals.com/epals/support/m/support-resources/325401.aspx). (See also verifiable consent via a child’s teacher, below).  
 

To provide consent by fax or post, parents should fill out the parental consent form, sign it and either fax it from North America to 1-703-885-3490 or mail it to:  
 

Cricket Media, Inc.  
13625-A Dulles Technology Drive  
Herndon, VA 20171 (USA)  
Attn: ePals Consent Form  
 

Teachers may provide consent electronically when creating accounts for their students, provided they confirm their authority to consent, and affirmatively indicate consent, on behalf of a parent or guardian of each such student to the collection of personal information from that student by Cricket and to the use and disclosure of such personal information by Cricket under the terms of this Privacy Policy and _Privacy Notice for Children Under 13_.  
 

If we receive consent from a parent, teacher or school administrator, your child’s ePals® membership will be activated.  
 

In2books verifies the teacher who has created the account for the school by receiving written consent from the school principal.  
 

If you are a student under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us unless (and until) you have first obtained consent from your parent, guardian or authorized teacher, and please do not send any personal information other than the limited information we request from you in connection with the Services.  
 

##### What Information Do We Collect From Children?

###### Personally Identifiable Information

We may collect the following types of personal information directly from children: date of birth and parent email address in order to notify the parent or the teacher and obtain consent. We may collect the following information from parents or teachers about a child: first name, last name, password, nickname, IP address, grade level, mailing address and parent’s name and email address. We also collect the IP addresses of child user’s computers, which may be considered in some circumstances to be personally identifiable information.  
 

We may also passively collect, through Users’ computers, mobile phones or other wireless devices and we also collect personally identifiable information through cookies from children’s computers. In connection with activities such as contests/Challenges, we do collect and share children’s images, audio and video submitted through such contest or Challenge but only after full parental consent has been obtained. Children are able to post on forums but such content is moderated and any personally identifiable information is removed and deleted before posting.  
 

###### Non-Personally Identifiable Information

We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information from visitors to our site, such as the date and time of their visit, the type of browser used ( _e.g.,_ Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system used ( _e.g.,_ Windows Server 2003 or Mac OS X), the ISP from which the visitor receives Internet access, and aggregate information regarding what pages users of the site access or visit.  
 

We may also collect non-personally identifiable information from registered members of certain Services (such as the member’s favorite pet or favorite book) and match it to personally identifiable information (such as the member’s name) in our database. Such combined information is kept in our internal database under the member’s user name.  
 

###### How Do We Use the Information We Collect From Children?

_Use of Personally Identifiable Information:_  
We may use the personally identifiable information that we collect from a child: (1) to determine whether he or she is eligible to use the Services; (2) to obtain consent from his or her parent, teacher or school administrator, as applicable, for the child to use the Services; (3) to provide an interactive online experience; (4) to provide customization and content recommendations; (5) to provide educational content that we believe that the child may be interested in or would benefit from; (6) to fulfill requests for products or services.  
 

_Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information:_  
We may use non-personally identifiable information (such as cookies and Web surfing habits associated with IP addresses) to improve the design, content and performance of the Services. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage and the popularity of the Services (individually or collectively).  
 

_Combined Information:_  
We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information from registered users (such as the member’s favorite pet or favorite book) and match it to personally identifiable information (such as the member’s name) in our database. Such combined information is kept in our internal database under the member’s user name. We do not share such information with third parties, but we may use it for statistical purposes later, such as to say, 25 percent of In2Books® third-graders have goldfish!  
 

##### Will Cricket Share My Child’s Personal Information with Third Parties?

We may disclose personally identifiable and/or non-personally identifiable information in certain limited circumstances, as set forth in Section III below.  
 

We moderate all user generated content to remove any personally identifiable information unless we have parent permission to share this publicly. However, while we take all reasonable steps to ensure that children do not share their personal information no system is foolproof.  
 

##### Can I Review, Change or Delete the Child Related Personal Information Cricket has Collected from My Child?

Yes, you can. You can review the Child Related Personal Information related to your child by making a request, as described below, at any time. You can also have the Child Related Personal Information related to your child deleted as described below and end authorization for further collection of such information by us. If you wish to view, delete or modify information:

  * _For ePals ®_ _:_ Members of ePals can review or edit, any Child Related Personal Information related to their child (such as the child’s name, phone number, email or postal address) by logging in to ePals and going to the preferences or settings page. Parents can also request that a child’s account be deleted at any time by emailing [support@cricketmedia.com](mailto:support@cricketmedia.com).

#### II. INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT FROM INDIVIDUALS 13 YEARS OLD AND OVER

Our privacy practices for data that we collect online from individuals 13 years old and over are generally similar to those for information that we collect from users under 13 years old, with specific collection practices, if any, identified in the case of purchasers of Products in the e-commerce section, [shop.cricketmedia.com](http://shop.cricketmedia.com/), (who must be 18 years of age or older, with a valid credit card).  
 

##### What Information Do We Collect From Individuals 13 Years Old and Over? What Information Do We Collect from Individuals Ordering Products through [shop.cricketmedia.com](http://shop.cricketmedia.com/)—those individuals 18 Years Old and Over?

Teachers who register for ePals® may create and post an online profile, with fields for class- and school-specific information, and brief description of their class (es) for matching purposes. A Teacher can elect to suppress his or her profile so that it does not surface during class-matching (in the Find Classroom area), provided, however, that the profile would be accessible if such teacher asks to join another teacher’s project or submits a project to the Join Project listing.  
 

It is our policy not to create profiles for any user identified by our system as being under 13 years old or identified as a student.  
 

##### For orders of Cricket Products:

We may collect personally identifiable and non-personally identification information in connection with such purchases. We need to collect and share some personally identifiable information from you in order for us, or our third party support and distributor vendor, CDS, acting as our agent, to process your order and which hosts the ecommerce portion of our site—[shop.cricketmedia.com](http://shop.cricketmedia.com/) When an individual puts an item in a shopping cart or places an order, we collect information associated with the transaction, may include the customer’s name, email, mailing address, products ordered, shipping address, and credit card information, as well as ship-to information (if Products are intended for someone other than the purchasing customer.)  Customers have the option of registering certain information for future orders while completing the online order at [shop.cricketmedia.com](http://shop.cricketmedia.com/). For customers who choose to register, we will capture login name, password, name and mailing address, billing address, alternate ship-to addresses, and credit card information. We, or our trusted service provider, CDS, will retain your registration information, including your credit card information, so we can process your request.  
 

For more information on CDS click here <http://www.cds-global.com/about/privacy-policy/>.  
 

When registered customers return to [shop.cricketmedia.com](http://shop.cricketmedia.com/) to place subsequent orders, they can identify themselves with their login name and passwords.  
 

When a customer places an order online, we will send a confirming email message. We may also send an occasional email featuring a special promotion or product that may be of interest to Product customers. Any customer who prefers not to receive an online order confirmation or promotional email may indicate this preference on the online store order form. If you do receive commercial emails from us that you would rather not receive, simply follow the “unsubscribe” instructions included in each message.  
 

##### Non-Personally Identifiable Information:

We may use non-personally identifiable information that we collect from users at least 13 years old to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage.  
 

We may also collect non-personally identifiable information from registered users (such as the member’s music tastes or hobbies) and match it to personally identifiable information (such as the member’s name) in our database. Such combined information is kept in our internal database under the member’s user name. We do not share such information with third parties, but we may use it for statistical purposes.  
 

##### How Do We Use Information that We Collect From Individuals Ages 13 and Over? How Do We Use Information that We Collect from Individuals Ordering Products-those Individuals 18 and Over?

As indicated previously, personally identifiable information collected for customers ordering Products is used by CDS, our service provider for order fulfillment (and the entity hosting [shop.cricketmedia.com](http://shop.cricketmedia.com/)), to process and fulfill Product orders. We ask such service provider to maintain the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information and not to use for any reason except to carry out the purpose(s) for which we hired them. In addition, if you, an individual 18+ initiates a purchase of a Product but do not complete the transaction, we may use the email address you provide to send you email for the purpose of requesting feedback on your purchase experience. You are not obligated to respond to such email, but if you do, we may use your feedback to improve the ordering experience.  
 

##### What does Cricket use my information for?

##### Generally

When you use the Services, you may set up your personal profile, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels, depending upon what category of User you are registered as (e.g., student, parent or teacher) (“User Category”), and as permitted by the functionality of the Services. The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve the Services, and allows Users to set up a User account and profile through particular Services, such as ePals.  
 

##### Your email address

If you provide us your email address, we may send you email communications. Web beacons may also be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails (and which links within those emails) have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you are a student, we will only use your email address to send you Notifications. To opt out of receiving emails from us with regard to our Services, please contact us at [support@cricketmedia.com](mailto:support@cricketmedia.com) with regard to Product customers, please contact us at [support@cricketmedia.com](mailto:support@cricketmedia.com). Please note that your ability to opt-out from receiving marketing and promotional materials does not change our right to contact you regarding your use of our website. Please note that if you do not want to receive even legal notices from us via email, such as changes to this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services and/or ordering Products, and you are responsible for visiting this Privacy Policy from time to time to review any changes.  
 

##### Your friend’s email address

If you are a teacher and you provide us with another teacher’s name and email address, we may send that teacher an email inviting him or her to visit the Services. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending such email (and, if applicable, subsequent “reminder” emails) and tracking the success of our referral program. The referred teacher may contact us at [support@cricketmedia.com](mailto:support@cricketmedia.com) to request that we remove this information with regard to ePals and/or in2Books from our database.  
 

##### Usage Information

Cricket uses certain aggregate data, standard web traffic and behavior analytics, to enable us to figure out how often users use parts of the Services, so that we can make the Services more appealing and relevant to users, and customize and improve the Services and/or Products. As part of our use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners (in a non-personally-identifiable format) about how our users use our site. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our partners’ services and the Services — to help us improve the Services (including by having great partner content and services). We may link usage information to Personal Information and Child Related Personal Information that we collect through the Services, but we will only use this linked information internally (for example, to customize your experience), and will not disclose it in linked format to third parties (unless such third parties are acting solely as our agents). Additionally, certain usage-related information may be viewable in your user profile that may be displayed to other users, depending on your User Category; for example, certain “badges” may displayed in your profile ( _g.,_ indicating successful completion of certain activities).  
 

##### Mobile Usage Information

The type of usage data described above, when collected from a mobile device is used to determine the device capabilities and usage trends which allows us to better understand which devices we should support and what features are most frequently used.  
 

#### III. INFORMATION SHARED WITH THIRD PARTIES

We may disclose personally identifiable and/or non-personally identifiable information with third parties in certain limited circumstances, as set forth below:  
 

##### Businesses We Do Not Control

In certain situations, we may share such information with affiliates, partners, and third party vendors who may offer or sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us). We may, for example, work jointly with other businesses to offer or sell products or provide services, or we may work with third party websites to enhance your online experience. These transactions or services may or may not be commercial in nature. We will share your Personal Information or Child Related Personal Information that you provide with that business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. Such services may include the ability for you to automatically transmit information you input on the Services to your profile or account on a third party website, or to automatically transmit information you input on a third party website to your Services profile. These third parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of any personally identifiable information provided to them through the Services. However, as we noted above, we have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites (or other offerings) as to privacy or anything else, so please review all third party websites’ policies before disclosing any Personal Information or Child Related Personal Information or other content on the Services or on any third party website (via the automatic transmissions discussed above or otherwise). Cricket is not in a position to, and is not responsible for, reviewing or verifying the accuracy of any third party’s data collection or use policies, or their compliance with such policies. If you have any concerns regarding any third party (e.g., if you would like a third party to cease contacting you or delete any of your information), please contact such third party directly. We sometimes make our list of the names and addresses of customers purchasing Products available to other carefully selected companies whose products and services we believe might be of interest to you. Be assured this does not involve sharing Children’s Personal Information for marketing. If you do not want to receive offers from these other companies, you, the purchaser of a Cricket Product, can opt out of these third party offers at any time in your account management section of the ecommerce portion of the Site, at [shop.cricketmedia.com](http://shop.cricketmedia.com/).  
 

##### Agents

We engage certain other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and sometimes need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples may include sending email, analyzing data, processing payments, providing user services, providing customer service, processing parental consents, and/or monitoring online forums and chatrooms. These third parties: (a) have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of personally identifiable information; and (b) do not have any right to use the Personal Information or Child Related Personal Information we share with them except as necessary to assist us.

  In connection with certain online contests or similar challenges involving submissions of user-generated content, we capture registration information that contains personal information from parents and/or teachers or students age 13 or older through the establishment of an account with our trusted service provider, Submittable, so that we can process your request. For more information on Submittable click here: <http://www.submittable.com/privacy>

##### Service Provider, Sub-Processors / Onward Transfer

We may transfer such information to these third party companies that help us provide our service (for example, in the case of Product purchases on the e-commerce portion of the Site). Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by: (a) the provisions in this Privacy Policy, (b) our applicable service agreements with such third party companies, and (c) our service providers’ respective privacy policies.  
 

##### Business Transfers

If Cricket, or some or all of its assets, were acquired or otherwise transferred, or in the unlikely event that Cricket goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information may be transferred to or acquired by a third party.  
 

##### Protection of Cricket and Others

We may release Personal Information or Child Related Personal Information when we believe in good faith that such release is necessary to comply with the law (such as to comply with a court order or subpoena), enforce or apply our [Terms of Use](http://www.cricketmedia.com/terms/) and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or safety of ePals, our employees, our users, or others. (For example, we may disclose such information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person). We will try to give you notice if we release information for these reasons, but please understand that we reserve the right not to, as it may not be practical, legal, or safe to do so.  
 

If you have any inquiries regarding our partner’s privacy practices or how they use your child’s personal information, please contact us directly at [support@cricketmedia.com](mailto:support@cricketmedia.com).
