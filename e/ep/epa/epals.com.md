At ePALS, we will do everything in our power to protect the privacy of our users and will never deliberately share your personally identifiable information with any third party (except as required by law) without your consent.

We are committed to protecting the privacy of you and your children while providing students and schools with the full global experience offered by the Internet. Our service fosters communication among parents, students and educators all around the world and we explain all of our interactive features in this policy. We also explain what information we collect from children and what information we may collect from educators and parents. We explain what this information is used for and how we maintain its privacy after we have collected it. We never require anyone to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in activities on ePALS.

### REGISTRATION PROCESS

Members can register in two ways - either directly or through an educator or parent.

#### Self-Registration

Members who register themselves are asked to fill out a form that requests some basic information. Student members are asked for their first name; members registering as parents, educators or higher education students are asked to provide a last name as well. All members are required to choose a username and password. We require the member's birthdate and country in order to determine if parental consent is required and what protocols to follow in order to obtain that consent. If the member's given age is under 13 years, we require the member to provide us with the email address of their parent or guardian. This email address is used to obtain consent from that parent or guardian before the registration process can continue.

For those users who are under 13 years of age, the self pre-registration process stops here. An email is sent to the child's parent or guardian, requesting that they consent to their child becoming a member of ePALS. ([Click here to view the notification message sent to parents](https://web.archive.org/privacy/parent_email.tpl).) We do not activate the username, open an email account, send a newsletter or otherwise permit the child to become a member until we have received verifiable parental consent. If we do not receive consent within 30 days, we delete all of the information we collected from the child (including the parental contact information).

Parents can provide consent for their children to use ePALS either by telephone, fax, or postal mail. Complete instructions are provided in the parental consent form available at [http://www.epals.com/privacy/forms/](https://web.archive.org/privacy/forms/). To provide consent by telephone, parents can call toll free from North America: 1-888-450-2332, or direct: 1-613-789-2332 and follow the instructions given. To provide consent by fax or post, parents should fill out the parental consent form, sign it and either fax it toll free from North America to 1-888-201-2332 (direct to 1-613-562-4768) or mail it to:

ePALS Classroom Exchange®  
353 Dalhousie Street  
Ottawa, Ontario  
K1N 7G1  
Canada  


In addition to the information we collect from children, we ask parents to provide their names, an email address and a three-digit personal identification number for identification purposes in case we need to contact them about their child's account in the future. Once we have received consent, the child's membership will be activated by an ePALS Administrator.

Members from whom we do not require parental consent are taken to a second registration page, where they can provide us with their city, street address, state or province and zip or postal code. This information is optional and is not required for registration on ePALS. Their mailing address may be used to send a print version of the ePALS Newsletter and makes it possible to generate customized street maps. Once this page is complete, the registration process is complete and the member will be able to use all of the ePALS site features.

#### Registration through an Educator or Parent

We also permit educators to register the students in their classes and parents are able to register their children. For children who are under 13, we instruct the account creators to print out the privacy policy and parental consent form and obtain written consent from the parents of any children being registered. Once they have indicated to us that they have received written parental consent, we permit them to register the accounts with access to all of the features described below.

We protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of the personal information we collect. This information is maintained on secure servers and is only accessible to qualified ePALS personnel who require it. Unauthorized access to our database has never occurred and we make every effort to ensure the security of data. Backups of our database are stored securely at an off-site storage facility. Our staff is trained and regularly updated on our privacy policies - we make it clear that the privacy of our members' information is everyone's responsibility.

### MEMBERSHIP FEATURES

An ePALS membership comes with access to our interactive features, such as email, private chat rooms, electronic greeting cards and discussion boards. As with other typical email accounts and chat rooms, children may disclose personal information (about themselves, their parents, friends or acquaintances) with their correspondents and in the online forums. Parents should advise their children not to give out any personal information without their consent on any website, whether in a public or private forum. Users under 18 cannot reveal any personally identifiable information in a public area of ePALS such as a discussion board - such information is blocked by ePALS Administrators who are moderating these areas.

Email is not a private medium. There are many ways that email can be intercepted on the Internet that are completely out of our control. As well, children need to understand never to give out their last or family name, their home address or their phone number in chat rooms, on bulletin boards or to their online pen-pals through email. We do not provide any supervision of this activity beyond that provided to parents or teachers with a Monitored Email Account.

Note: Students whose teachers are members but who are not members themselves, may also participate in some interactive functions on the ePALS site. 

#### Email

Self-registered ePALS members are given an unrestricted ePALS Webmail account (e.g., username.com). With this kind of account, members can send and receive email from anyone. Children under the age of 13 cannot register an unrestricted Webmail account unless their parent consents to the registration.

We also offer parents the option of providing their children with a Monitored Email account, which puts control of the email account into adult hands. With Monitored Email, an adult creates an email account for the child or student and can then preview and approve each message sent to or from the child before it reaches its recipient. With Monitored Email, the individual who creates the monitored account (the Monitor) is the only one who has access to and control over the account, until and unless the account gets moved to another Monitor at the original Monitor's discretion. The Monitor has total discretion over how tightly to control the account. By default, every message must be seen and approved by the Monitor before reaching its recipient. However, the Monitor can reduce the level of control, even turning filtering off altogether if desired. If the Monitor is a teacher, then these changes can proceed without parental interaction. (As always, if a child is under 13 the teacher must obtain parental consent before creating the account but the teacher is not obliged to seek permission before changing the child's account settings.)

If you want your child to receive a Monitored Email account, you must first create an account for yourself with ePALS. Then, create a Monitored account by clicking the "Monitored Accounts" link on your personal settings page and following the given instructions. The Monitored account(s) you create will automatically be assigned to you and be your responsibility. Please note that even if you create a Monitored account, a child 13 or older will still be able to register themselves and create an unrestricted account under a different username. If you wish to create an unrestricted account for your child, simply turn all monitoring filters off.

When creating Monitored Accounts, the parent or educator inputs the name(s) of the child (or children) who will use the account, along with a password. A username will automatically be generated for this user. Generated usernames are a combination of some letters from the user's first name and some letters of the last name or numbers. In no event will the generated username be the child's full name. The adult creating the account can change the proposed username at the account registration phase. Once this process is completed, the username cannot be changed - however the account can be deleted and a new account, with the chosen username, can be created. The first time the child signs on with their new username they will be asked to pick a new, personal password.

Regardless of whether a child is self-registered or registered by a parent or educator, under no circumstance will the child's full name be visible, either on ePALS.com or in the header of any email sent by that child.

#### Private Chatrooms

Our members are able to create private chatrooms with a name and password of their own choosing. A member who creates such a chatroom can invite whomever they wish to join the discussion simply by providing them with the chatroom's name and password. Only ePALS members may participate and the private chatroom discussion is only available to the participants. We do not directly supervise this activity.

#### Electronic Greeting Cards

ePALS members can send electronic greeting cards, or eCards, to anyone whose email address they know. eCards consist of an image supplied by ePALS and space for a greeting and personal message. The recipient receives an email notification to view the card (which includes the email address of the sender) and is given a URL on ePALS to visit where the card will be displayed. ePALS maintains the information required to send and display the eCard for a period of three months, after which all information is deleted. eCards can only be sent by ePALS members. eCards sent from or to a Monitored account will be scanned for profanity and must be approved by the user's Monitor before reaching a recipient.

We also send eCards to our members on their birthday.

#### Moderated Discussion Boards

ePALS Moderated Discussion Boards allow ePALS members to submit new topics and messages to a publicly-accessible forum. All topics and messages are monitored and pre-screened by ePALS Administrators and are typically posted to the Discussion Board within 24 hours. If Discussion Board messages are deemed to be inappropriate at ePALS' sole discretion, then they will either be edited or not posted. ePALS does not allow the posting of personally identifiable information in Discussion Boards by those under 18. This could include the child's last name, email address or any other unique identifiers. Discussion Board postings can be viewed by anyone who visits the site but only ePALS members can post to the Boards. 

#### Newsletters

ePALS offers its members a monthly newsletter on new site features and general Internet and education information. Members can subscribe during registration by checking the appropriate box on their registration form. They can unsubscribe at any time by unchecking the appropriate box on their ePALS settings page or by following the unsubscribe link that appears in every newsletter. Once their membership is activated, users under 13 who signed up for the newsletter in the pre-registration process will begin to receive it. Our newsletter does not contain any advertising directed towards children.

#### Collaborative Projects

In the course of using ePALS, teachers will often want to participate in collaborative projects with other classes. These projects could involve as many classes as the teacher wishes and typically combine offline classwork with online collaboration. This collaboration could occur using any of our tools including email, voice or text chat. These features are run by teachers using their own ePALS accounts. 

#### E-Commerce

ePALS offers links to various online stores that offer merchandise of interest to teachers and parents in the ePALS Emporium section of the site. ePALS staff have carefully chosen e-commerce partners that provide only products appropriate to educators and parents, but cannot guarantee the contents of these external sites. Members are alerted when following a link on the site will take them to another site. 

#### Reviewing, Editing and Deleting Information

Members can review, edit, or delete any personal information (such as their name, phone number, email or postal address) by logging in and going to their personal settings page. Members can request that their accounts be deleted at any time by contacting ePALS Support at [support.com](mailto:support.com).

Parents can review their child's personal information at any time. They can also have that information deleted and refuse to permit further collection of information by us. If you wish to view, delete or modify this information, simply contact ePALS Support via a [feedback link](https://web.archive.org/feedback/form/form.e) or by emailing [support.com](mailto:support.com), and indicate the changes you wish to have made. If you want your child's personal information modified or deleted and their membership terminated, simply send your request to ePALS support.

#### Co-Branded Partner Sites

We have joined with some partner websites to offer their users access to our features. Those users coming to ePALS from a link on such a partner site will see a customized version of the ePALS interface, featuring both the ePALS and the partner site's brand. The partner site does not gain access to the information submitted by participants who sign up through their interface. 

#### Tell-a-Friend

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. ePALS will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. ePALS stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. The recipient may contact ePALS at [support.com](mailto:support.com) to request the removal of this information from our database.

#### Links to Other Websites

For the enjoyment of our members, we also link to other sites. We are not responsible for those other sites and we advise you to check their privacy policies.

### COOKIES

Cookies are pieces of information that a Website transfers to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A browser that supports cookies is required before a user can login to ePALS. We use cookies to personalize the site and to make using the site easier during each session by keeping track of language preference, channel and login status. 

Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard and many major Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.

We also gather standard logfile data such as the date, time, referrer, browser and platform used for all visits to the site. This information is analyzed monthly and is used to gain a broad picture of usage patterns at ePALS. This information is never linked to any individual user.

### DATA COLLECTION FROM ADULTS

In addition to the information detailed above, we also collect additional information from adults. For example, a teacher registering with ePALS is requested to provide their school name and address, to enable us to verify their registration. In addition, we offer those who register as teachers the opportunity to create and post an online profile, with fields for name, school name, school URL (optional), grade level taught, range of ages of students, languages spoken, total number of students in that class, any additional communication capabilities (optional), school street address, and a brief description of their class for matching purposes. The profile can be viewed by any visitor to the site, though only registered ePALS members can attempt to make contact with the teacher who created the profile. 

### NOTICE OF CHANGES

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users (and the parents of child members) are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

If, however, we intend to use members' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users or their parents will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
