# EPage Privacy Policy

EPage® has created this privacy statement in order to  demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.  The following discloses our  information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: ep.com. 

Your IP address is transmitted to each web server every time you make a request. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site.  We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous. 

If you take out an ad on EPage® or become an affiliate we use temporary cookies to help format the page, and indicate what ads you can view. We also place permanent cookies to enable some of the advanced benefits, such as viewing all ads, for Gold members. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. 

Our site's registration process may require users to give us contact information (like name and email address) and unique identifiers (like social security number or tax identification number).  The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary.  Unique identifiers (such as email addresses) are collected for use as account numbers in our record system. For affiliate relationships, social security numbers may be used to report income to the appropriate government authorities. 

This site contains links to other sites. EPage® is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

EPage® serves and receives ads from third party sites (our affiliates). Information not displayed in the ad (and thus not available to the general public via the Web) is not made available to these third party participants. 

EPage® uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. Our third-party advertising companies also may separately place or recognize a cookie file on your browser in the course of delivering advertisements to this Site.  These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by DoubleClick's Sonar Network, please go to:

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.
