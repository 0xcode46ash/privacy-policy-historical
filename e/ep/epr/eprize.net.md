# Privacy Statement for ePrize

## _Privacy Statement for ePrize, Inc. _

ePrize, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website [http://www.eprize.net](http://www.eprize.net/) and for the sweepstakes placed on our customers websites. It also explains what options users may have to access and manage the information collected from them.

  **CONSENT TO THIS POLICY:**

By using our site, you agree to this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to this Privacy Statement, please do not use our site or enter any ePrize sweepstakes.

**Information Collection and Use: **

ePrize is the owner of the information collected through its site. ePrize collects information from users at several different points on our website. ePrize may automatically collect information about your computer configuration, such as your browser type, operating system, or ISP domain name. This information will not reveal your personal identity and may be used by ePrize to administer the technical and operational aspects of this site, and may include using your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server.  Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

If you choose to participate, ePrize will also collect information identifying you when you register, or enter the online sweepstakes. Participation in the sweepstakes is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Contact information will be used to notify any winner(s) and award prizes. 

**Sharing of User Information: **

We share user information with our Customers and may share information with advertisers or other parties.

**Cookies: **

Our site uses cookies (a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user) to track and target the interests of users and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, and for other purposes. The user may set his/her browser to reject cookies.  If a user rejects cookies, the user may be limited in some areas of the site.

**Special Note about Children:**

ePrize sweepstakes are not available to anyone under the age of 18 and no information should be submitted to this site by anyone under the age of 18.

**Registration: **

 ePrize’s sweepstakes entry forms and registration forms require users to give ePrize real world and online contact information ( such as their name, address and email address, if any), and non-identifying demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We may also ask several survey style questions to collect lifestyle or purchase intent information. We use this contact information from the entry form or registration form to send the user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The user’s contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary, notify prize winners and shared with other companies who may want to contact our users. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data for other purposes. This information may be shared with ePrize Customers and advertisers on an aggregate or individual basis. 

This site contains links to other sites. ePrize, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

We may use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads may be collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. Some user data may be shared with the advertising companies.

**How Long Do We Retain User Data** :

Generally, we retain user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we may reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to legal and business requirements.

**How Do We Protect User Information: **

We maintain reasonable practices to help protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our site reduce the likelihood of security problems.
