# Privacy Policy | ePrize

## ePrize, Inc. Privacy Policy

###### Last Revised: March 29, 2013

ePrize, Inc. is a company that helps other businesses operate sweepstakes, contests and promotions ("Promotions"). In addition, ePrize occasionally runs its own Promotions. Such Promotions gather personally identifiable information from those individuals who choose to enter a particular Promotion and anonymous data regarding the Promotion itself. ePrize takes its privacy obligations both to its clients and to people who enter its Promotions very seriously. ePrize complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. ePrize has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view ePrize’s certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

This policy outlines our treatment of personally identifiable information we collect on behalf of our clients and for our own use. There are three types of Promotions in which ePrize is involved: 1) Client Promotions; 2) ePrize "Opt-in" to Client Promotions; and 3) ePrize Promotions.  

### Client Promotions

As a full service promotions and sweepstakes agency, ePrize operates Promotions on behalf of its clients. As part of those services, ePrize collects personally identifiable information for its clients by use of ePrize's proprietary online technology, ePrize mailboxes, and points of entry offline. ePrize collects such personally identifiable information solely for the use of its clients and the operation of the Promotions. Such uses may include, notification of potential winners, fulfillment of prizes, and marketing analysis. ePrize strictly limits access to all personally identifiable information within its organization, and data is never shared outside of the company for any reason whatsoever (with, of course, the exception of its clients, appropriate governmental or legal requests). Personally identifiable information collected from different client Promotions is never shared with anyone other than the client on whose behalf the information was collected. Personally identifiable information collected by ePrize on behalf of a client belongs solely to the client and will be used solely in accordance with that particular client's Privacy Policy. An individual's desire to "opt-out" of receiving marketing or other information from a client will be handled in accordance with a particular client's Privacy Policy. ePrize requires its clients, by contract, to use the data which ePrize collects on its behalf in accordance with generally accepted privacy standards for both offline and online data, which includes an "opt-out" method for individuals who have provided personally identifiable information. Ultimately, however, ePrize is not responsible for data collected on behalf of its clients when such data is in its client's possession. Where ePrize operates one Promotion on behalf of multiple clients, the use of the personally identifiable information by all of the companies involved will be clearly outlined by a Privacy Policy created for that Promotion.

### ePrize “Opt-in” to Client Promotions

From time to time, ePrize and one of its clients will agree to allow ePrize to offer entrants to a Promotion an opportunity to "opt-in" to receiving marketing information from ePrize and its partners. In such cases, on the Promotion registration page, an ePrize "opt-in" question will appear clearly explaining to potential entrants that by checking the box they will be agreeing to share their personally identifiable information with ePrize. When individuals "opt-in" to receive information from ePrize, they are agreeing to receive email and other notices from ePrize, including marketing messages, surveys, special offers and notices about other Promotions. Such notices may come from ePrize itself, companies with whom ePrize has a business relationship and/or ePrize clients.

If you want to "opt-out" of receiving such notices from ePrize after you have "opted-in", or you wish to correct the information you have provided to ePrize, you may do so in one of two (2) ways:

  1. Please send an email to [remove@eprize.com](mailto:remove@eprize.com). Please make sure to include the name of the promotion in the subject line and in the body of the email from which you wish to opt-out. Failure to provide this information may delay the processing of your request.
  2. Mail the details of your request to:  
Privacy Policy c/o ePrize, Inc.  
One ePrize Drive  
Pleasant Ridge, MI 48069



### ePrize Promotions

ePrize also runs Promotions on its own behalf. Such Promotions are to generate interest from other businesses in ePrize's products and services. ePrize uses the personally identifiable information collected in such Promotions as sales leads and may contact the individual registrants by email, mail or phone. ePrize will never sell such information or share it with another business. When individuals "opt-in" to receive information from ePrize, they are agreeing to receive email and other notices from ePrize, including marketing messages, surveys, special offers and notices about other Promotions. Such notices may come from ePrize itself or from ePrize on behalf of companies with whom ePrize has a business relationship. If you want to "opt-out" of being contacted by ePrize after you have participated in one of its Promotions, or you wish to correct the information you have provided to ePrize, you may do so in one of two (2) ways:

  1. Please send an email to [remove@eprize.com](mailto:remove@eprize.com). Please make sure to include the name of the promotion in the subject line and in the body of the email from which you wish to opt-out. Failure to provide this information may delay the processing of your request.

### ePrize’s Online Promotion Technology

ePrize's proprietary Promotion technology has the ability to collect data other than personally identifiable information for any of the three (3) kinds of Promotions it operates online. ePrize may collect information about your computer configuration such as your browser type, operating system, or ISP domain name. ePrize may collect information about the site you last visited prior to the Promotion or about your activity during your visit to the Promotion site. ePrize may also offer social sign-on services that allow you to register for a promotion using a third-party social networking site such as Facebook, Google or Twitter.  By using these services you allow ePrize to access the available information from your third-party social network profile such as your name, age, gender, location, email address and list of friends.  This information may be used by ePrize to administer the technical and operational aspects of the site, and may include using your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server. Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

### Mobile

As a full service promotions and sweepstakes agency, ePrize also operates mobile Promotions on behalf of its clients and itself. As part of those mobile services, ePrize collects personally identifiable information by use of ePrize's proprietary mobile technology. ePrize will not collect personally identifiable information from you without your permission. We shall treat any information you send to us as non-confidential and non-proprietary and we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any data you submit to us, though we will use reasonable efforts to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data under our control, including physical, electronic and procedural safeguards. ePrize respects your privacy. We will only use the information you provide, including your mobile number, to send you content pursuant to the program in which you have requested to participate, though we will share the information we collected from you with the client on whose behalf we collected it. We will not use your information for any other purpose.  ePrize is not responsible for information collected on behalf of its clients when such information is in its client's possession. However, we reserve the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation or governmental request, to avoid liability, or to protect our rights or property. When you provide us information in connection with a program, you agree to provide accurate, complete and true information. You agree not to use a false or misleading name or a name that you are not authorized to use. If we, in our sole discretion, believe that any such information is untrue, inaccurate or incomplete, we may prohibit you from further participation in the applicable program and pursue any appropriate legal remedies.

### Cookies

ePrize uses cookies in order to improve your user experience by enabling our promotions to ‘remember’ you or your preferences, either for the duration of your single visit (using "session cookies") or during additional visits ("persistent cookies").

Cookies serve lots of different purposes, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences or settings, and overall improving your experience with our promotions. Cookies make the interaction between you and ePrize promotions faster and easier. If a website doesn’t use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site – for example, when you enter your login details and move to another page it won’t recognize you and it won’t be able to keep you logged in.

Some websites will also use cookies to enable them to target their advertising or marketing messages based for example, on your location and/or browsing habits.

Cookies may be set by the website domain you are visiting (these are considered ‘first party cookies’) or they may be set by other website domains who run content on the page you are viewing (these are considered ‘third party cookies’). This extra content can include things like the Facebook "Like" button, Twitter's "Tweet" button, or other integrations with third party sites and aggregators. Any third party cookies or other tracking technologies implemented by third parties for integration purposes will be governed by the privacy policy of the third party and will not be used by ePrize for tracking or data collection.

### What is inside a cookie?

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer or device by a website. Only that website will be able to read the contents of that cookie. Each and every cookie is unique to your web browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and some digits and numbers. It allows a website to remember things like your preferences or to remember who you are on return visits.

### What to do if you don’t want cookies to be set:

Some people find the idea of a website storing information on their computer or mobile device a bit intrusive, particularly when that information is stored and used by a third party without their consent. If you do not want to see advertising that has been targeted to your interests or activities, it is possible to block some or all cookies, or even to delete cookies that have already been set; but you might lose some or all of that website's functionality.

### Special Note about Children

Unless otherwise specifically indicated, ePrize Promotions are not available to anyone under the age of thirteen (13). ePrize does, however, operate some Promotions on behalf of its clients which collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13). In each such instance, ePrize and its clients comply fully with all aspects of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") in the operation of the Promotion, in the collection of the information itself and in the subsequent use of the data collected. Personally identifiable information will not be collected from children under the age of thirteen (13) without parental consent in compliance with the COPPA guidelines.

### Your California Privacy Rights (As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)

A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.
