# EPRI: EPRI Privacy Statement

### EPRI.com Privacy Statement

The following privacy statement describes how EPRI will treat personally identifiable information collected when you visit EPRI.COM. Personal information is information by which you can be individually identified (such as your name, mailing address, business title, business phone and e-mail address). While you can visit this Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself, access to the majority of EPRI.COM pages is restricted to registered users who have provided us with certain personal information described below. The part of EPRI.COM that can only be accessed by registered users is referred to as EPRIwebÂ®. 

_Volunteered Personal Information_

EPRI collects personally identifiable information you provide when you register for an EPRIweb user ID and password or when you provide information requested by various forms on the site. Once you have provided this information, you are no longer anonymous. EPRI uses this information for the purpose of serving you better, to personalize your experience when visiting our site, as well as to contact you. We also use this information to analyze the site and its users and for other administrative purposes. 

We may share personally identifiable information you provide with others in the EPRI family of companies. A list of these companies can be viewed by selecting the link for [Family of Companies](http://www.epri.com/corporate/discover_epri/epri_subs/index.html) on the [EPRI.COM Home page](http://www.epri.com/). 

EPRI may engage the services of third parties to help with various aspects of its operations. We will send personally identifiable information about you to these third parties if it is necessary to provide a service that you have requested. However, we will take commercially reasonable steps to restrict their access to that information which is needed for them to perform their services for EPRI. 

_Cookies and Log Files_

EPRI uses "cookies" to recognize you, identify your access privileges on EPRIweb and enhance our ability to tailor the site to your individual preferences. This allows us to better serve you on subsequent visits to our site. (Cookies are small data files containing personal information you have provided about yourself that are placed on your hard drive.) We may use this information for general purposes, to fulfill your requests for information, services and products and to contact you with information we believe may interest you. We will not knowingly allow other companies to set and access their cookies on your computer through this site nor will we knowingly allow other companies access to our cookies. You can set your browser to notify you before cookies are set and you can reject cookies before they are set but this will effect your use of our site. 

We may also receive and record information from our server logs from your browser. This information may include your IP address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet), the domain name, information about the pages you request and your use of our site. We use log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personal information. 

_Site Registration/User ID and Password_

Access to the majority of webpages on EPRI.COM requires registration. At registration, we collect name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, and demographic information. Access to pages for a particular EPRI Research Target are restricted to eligible representatives of companies participating in that Research Target. This generally requires that you be an employee of an EPRI Member that has a currently effective EPRI Membership Agreement and Master License Agreement. The use of password protected pages and the information or products downloadable from those pages is governed by these written agreements between the EPRI Member company and EPRI as well as any clickthrough agreements found on the site itself. Personal information provided to EPRI at registration may be retained to verify compliance with these agreements, log licenses granted and downloads, or track other applications which may be available on EPRIweb. From time to time, limited registration is offered to employees of non-Member companies participating in special initiatives to enable them to access EPRIweb pages specifically for that initiative. Registered Users can also view their company's EPRI funding information and non-financial information about other companies participating in the same EPRI Targets. If you do not have an EPRIweb user ID and would like one, go to the [EPRI.COM Home page](http://www.epri.com/) and select the [New Users: Register](http://www.epri.com/membership/enroll_user1.asp) link and follow the directions on how to obtain your personal EPRIweb ID. If you are eligible, you will receive your ID & Password within 2-3 business days. 

We may also use personal information to perform statistical analysis of interest in various areas of our site, to allow access to products that have been purchased, and to communicate with you about our products and services. Upon request, we will remove you from any of our mailing lists. Send your request via e-mail to [askepri@epri.com](mailto:askepri@epri.com). 

Remember, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user ID and passwords. Please be careful when you're on-line. 

_The EPRI People Directory_

EPRIweb includes an EPRI People Directory with listings for over 30,000 people. The People Directory is used to facilitate interaction between EPRI and its customers and between customers. The People Directory contains information that an individual has provided to EPRI or one of the EPRI family of companies when registering for an EPRIweb user ID and password as well as other information that has been voluntarily provided in some contact with EPRI or a member of the EPRI family of companies (such as requests to be added to EPRI mailing lists, enrollment in EPRI workshops, etc.). This information is updated annually or upon request by e-mail to [askepri@epri.com](mailto:askepri@epri.com). The People Directory can be viewed by selecting the [People Directory](http://www.epri.com/dss_25.asp) link in the "People" box on the [EPRIweb Home page](http://www.epri.com/). 

_Message Boards, Chats and Similar Sites_

Whenever you voluntarily disclose information on-line on message boards, chat or similar sites, that information can be collected and used by others. Any information you disclose when posting a message in any of these forums becomes public. If you make your e-mail address available in these forums it could result in unsolicited e-mail from others. 

_Hyperlinks_

EPRI may provide hyperlinks to other Web sites strictly as a convenience to visitors to our site. You should note when you have left EPRI.COM and read the privacy policy of the new site if you are providing personal information on that site. Please be aware that EPRI has no control over any linked site and is not responsible for the privacy or other practices of linked sites. A link from this site to another site does not imply affiliation or endorsement of the quality, reliability, goods or services, information, opinions, decency or other content of the linked site. 

_Security_

EPRI.COM is hosted by a third party Website hosting specialist. We do this because we are committed to respecting your privacy and believe this is the best way to ensure appropriate physical, electronic and administrative security for your personal information. However, we cannot guarantee total privacy and there is no way to ensure perfect security in the Internet. 

EPRI uses standard industry practices to secure the databases of personal information we maintain ourself. If you have questions about the security of our Website, you can contact EPRI's Manager of On-line Services at 1 800-255-3774. 

_Correcting and Updating Personal Information_

We do our best to maintain the accuracy of personal information you have provided to us. If your personal information changes, or if you believe the information we have may be incorrect and you have an EPRIweb user ID and password, you may correct the information yourself by going to the [EPRIweb Home page](http://www.epri.com/) and selecting the [Update User Info](http://www.epri.com/membership/updateuser.asp) link located under "Your EPRIweb Info". If you are unable to change speific information, contact the [EPRI Customer Assistance Center](http://www.epri.com/contact.asp). Mistakes and miscommunications are possible but we endeavor to correct them as soon as they are brought to our attention. 

EPRI takes commercially reasonable steps to avoid disclosure of your personal information without your permission, except as described in this statement or under special circumstances (such as when we believe in good faith that it is necessary to avoid injury or interference with EPRI's rights or property or that of other users). We will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone or use it for purposes unrelated to the purpose for which you provided the information, except as described in this statement. If you believe that EPRI is not abiding by this posted privacy notice, you should e-mail us at [askepri@epri.com](mailto:askepri@epri.com) or contact EPRI's Manager of On-line Services. We will take all reasonable steps to address your concerns and protect the information you provide to us. 

Internet technologies are rapidly developing and e-business models are still evolving. Accordingly, these guidelines are subject to change as appropriate and any changes will be posted in this notice. This statement was last revised 10/2001.
