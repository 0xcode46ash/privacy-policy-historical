Use of Personal Information

If you choose to give us Personal Information, Epson may use it to support our customer relationship with you. For example, we may post or email to you from time to time announcements of Product upgrades, special offers, competitions, promotions and other new Products and services that we offer.

We will not use or disclose personal information for direct marketing purposes, unless:

Epson may also disclose Personal Information to independent research agencies that are contracted to act on behalf of Epson, for the sole purpose of allowing them to conduct Product or customer research.

Epson has strict privacy conditions in place with such agencies to ensure the protection of Personal Information. 

We may also give your address details to third parties (such as couriers, Australia Post or promotions fulfillment houses, to enable them to deliver a prize, reward or online purchase to you.)

Completing a technical or pre-sales query form may result in personal information being disclosed to overseas recipients in the United States of America, Philippines and Japan either contracted to or working Epson.
