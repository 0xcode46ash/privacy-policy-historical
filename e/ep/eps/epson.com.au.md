## Use of Personal Information

If you choose to give us Personal Information, Epson may use it to support our customer relationship with you. For example, we may post or email to you announcements of Product upgrades, special offers, competitions, promotions and other new products and services from time to time.

Epson will not share, rent, sell or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to any other companies or organizations without first seeking and obtaining your consent, except as explained below. 

However, Epson may disclose general information about its customers and Site members to third parties such as advertisers and business partners. For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of Site users is in a particular age bracket or is a PC or Macintosh user.

Epson may also disclose Personal Information to independent research agencies who have been contracted to act on behalf of Epson, for the sole purpose of instructing them to conduct product or customer research. Such agencies may also collect end-user Product reviews on Epson’s behalf for the purpose of publishing these reviews on Epson’s websites. Epson has strict privacy conditions in place with its agencies to ensure the protection of Personal Information. Such agencies will be bound not to use or disclose Person Information for any other purpose.

## Bank Account Details

Occasionally, Epson conducts cashback promotions via EFT, requiring customers to enter their bank account numbers into our systems. This is done using the SSL secure encrypted technologies and the numbers are store in encrypted format. Six months after direct deposits are processed; all associated bank account numbers are automatically deleted from our systems.

## When Can We Disclose Information to Third Parties?

In addition to contracted survey agencies, we may also give your address details to third parties (such as couriers, Australia Post or promotions fulfilment houses, to allow them to deliver a prize or reward to you.)

Otherwise, we will only disclose Personal Information to third parties without first seeking your consent, if we are required by law to do so, for example by a government agency.
