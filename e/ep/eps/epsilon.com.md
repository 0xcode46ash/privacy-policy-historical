****Epsilon's Privacy Policy****

 **What Personal Information Does Epsilon Collect?  
**  
Epsilon uses the information it collects to improve your experience with Epsilon, including personalizing and enhancing the experience we provide to you on our web site.  The types of information we may collect about you include:

  


  * **Information You Give Us.  ** We receive and store any information you enter on our web site, through registration and other forms, or give us in any other way.  This may include you name, the company you work for, postal address, email address, telephone number, marketing preferences, and other information.  

  * **Information From Other Sources.**   We may receive information about you from other sources.  If you provide information to Epsilon, we may collect additional information about you, including information about you from Epsilon affiliates and other sources.  For more information, read about [Fair Information Practices](http://www.epsilon.com/Privacy-Policy/p24-l1#11) below.  

  * **Automatic Information:** We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our web sites.  For example, like many web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses Epsilon's web sites.  This may include individual and aggregate visitor preferences and session information, as well as information such as your IP address and the browser you are using.  There are a number of utilities designed to help you visit web sites, including ours, anonymously. Our use of cookies is described in greater detail in the following section. 



**What Are Cookies And How Does Epsilon Use Them?**

A cookie is a text-only string of information that a web site transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Many cookies last only through a single session, or visit. Others may have an expiration date, or may remain on your computer until you delete them.  Cookies can help a web site to arrange content to match you r preferred interests more quickly and also to improve the user experience. Most major web sites use cookies.

Web beacons may be used to monitor web site traffic in conjunction with cookies. A web beacon is a graphic on a web page or in an email message designed to track pages viewed and messages opened. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-pixel by 1-pixel in size. We may place Web beacons on our web pages to collect data about visitors. When a user requests an Epsilon web page, a web beacon may be retrieved/activated. Once the Web beacon is retrieved/activated, it points to an external site to retrieve the image. At that time it can also pass along information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web beacon was viewed and for how long, and the type of browser that retrieved the image. This information can then be compiled and made available to Epsilon. Web beacons, along with cookies, enable us to enhance your experience on the Epsilon site. Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity. The web beacon may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address, but unique information will not be recorded (information on how to turn off cookies provided below).

  


  * **How Does Epsilon Use Cookies?  ** We use cookies for a number of purposes - for example, to maintain continuity during a user session, to gather data about the usage of our web site for research and other purposes, to store your preferences for certain kinds of information and marketing offers, or to store a username or encrypted customer identification number so that you do not have to provide this information every time you return to our site. We may share some cookie information we gather with Epsilon affiliate companies. Our cookies may be, but typically are not, used to gather personally identifiable information including what site pages a visitor accesses.

Our Web site also uses Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information (which does not include personally identifiable information) from visitors to the Web site to help us continue to improve the quality of our Web site. Omniture uses cookies to help track visitor behavior and sets cookies on behalf of Epsilon. Omniture does not use cookies to relate Web site visitors to any personally identifiable information. Omniture provides Epsilon with information about site usage that reflects individual behavior of visitors, but not their identity. All data collected by Omniture on behalf of Epsilon is used only to provide us with information on site usage and is not shared with any other third parties. To view the privacy policy of Omniture, [click here](http://www.omniture.com/privacy/policy). If you do not wish to allow your session visitation information to be aggregated and analyzed by Omniture, you may utilize the opt out mechanism found under the heading "OPT OUT METHOD" by [clicking here](http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product).

  * **How Can I Prevent The Use of Cookies?  ** You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable or delete cookies altogether. However, please note that if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain online services or web site features.

Additional Important Privacy Information**

**How Does Epsilon Protect the Privacy of Information It Collects and Manages on Behalf of Its Clients?**

Epsilon works with the world's leading marketers (our clients) to develop direct mail and permission-based email marketing communications to send to their customers (client's customers/consumers). Epsilon also creates database technology solutions and strategic data/list solutions for its clients.

Epsilon's role in supporting our clients may include hosting client data, compiling or procuring prospect/acquisition data for our clients, delivery of direct mail or email, tracking results of direct mail or email campaigns, analysis of data, hosting of response data collection sites, and transferring collected data back to our clients or to an Epsilon hosted database.

Epsilon treats all client customer data as confidential. Epsilon is contractually bound to keep our clients' customer data private and this data is never shared across clients or with any third-party that is not authorized by a client to receive its customer data. Epsilon only uses its client's customer data for the specific purpose of providing services to its clients as authorized by our clients. It is our client's responsibility (as a user of our products and services) to provide proper notice to its customers/consumers with regard to any required notices as to its data collection and data use practices, including any email or internet tracking devices.

Epsilon may, however, share our client's customer data with an Epsilon affiliate company or another company if such sharing is in connection with providing services to our clients, or in relation to a sale or consolidation of Epsilon's assets, provided, however, that all such companies agree to honor all of the privacy commitments set forth in this Policy and have demonstrated appropriate levels of their ability to so protect the privacy of our client's data.

Some of our clients independently use Epsilon's technology platforms to design and send their direct mail or email campaigns without the involvement Epsilon support staff. Epsilon informs all of its clients in writing about its stringent Policy against sending unsolicited commercial email, or sending direct mail in a manner not consistent with Direct Marketing Association (DMA) guidelines. In addition, before companies can use Epsilon technology to send email, they must commit to us in writing that consumers have agreed to receive such email messages. If problems arise with a client's direct mail or email campaign, Epsilon works with the client to resolve the problems and may prevent the use of its products and services by such client for further direct mail or email campaigns until the problems are corrected. If Epsilon determines that a client has knowingly used its system s for sending unsolicited commercial email, or direct mail in a manner inconsistent with DMA guidelines, it will immediately revoke the client's permission to send direct mail or email using our products or our systems.
