**Browser Information Collected on This Web Site**

Epsilon logs IP addresses and domain names and aggregates them for system administration purposes and to monitor the use of our site. We use the aggregated information to measure the number of visits to our site, the average time spent on our site, the number of pages viewed, to monitor various other site statistics and to diagnose problems with our server. The monitoring process helps us continuously improve the content we provide. Epsilon does not share these statistics with outside parties and does not link IP addresses or domain names with any personally identifying information, which means that a visitor’s session will be logged on our servers, but the visitor will remain anonymous. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a text-only string of information that a web site transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Many cookies last only through a single session, or visit. Others may have an expiration date, or may remain on your computer until you delete them.

Epsilon may use cookies for a number of purposes - for example, to maintain continuity during a user session, to gather data about the usage of our web site for research and other purposes, to store your preferences for certain kinds of information and marketing offers, or to store a username or encrypted customer identification number so that you do not have to provide this information every time you return to our site. Cookies set by us cannot be read by, and are not shared with, any non-Epsilon Web site. Our cookies may be, but typically are not, used to gather personally identifiable information.

You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser.

**Epsilon Clients**

_Protection of Your Customer’s Privacy When Doing Business with Epsilon  
_  
Epsilon works with the world's leading marketers (our clients) to create permission-based email marketing communications to send to its customers (client’s customers or consumers). 

Epsilon's role in supporting our clients may include hosting the actual collection site, delivery of email, tracking results of email campaigns, analysis of data, and transferring collected data back to our client. Epsilon is contractually bound to keep our clients' customer data private and this data is never shared across clients. It is our client’s responsibility (as sender of the email communication) to provide proper notice to its customers and consumers with regard to any email or internet tracking devices being used in its email communications. 

Epsilon may also share our client’s customer data with an affiliate company or another company if such sharing is in connection with providing services to our clients, or in relation to a sale or consolidation of Epsilon’s assets, provided, however, that all such companies agree to honor all of the privacy commitments set forth in this Policy and have demonstrated appropriate levels of their ability to so protect the privacy of our client’s data. 

Some of our clients use Epsilon's email marketing technology platform to design and send their campaigns without the assistance of Epsilon’s marketing support. Epsilon informs all of its clients in writing about its stringent Policy against sending unsolicited commercial email. If such problems arise with a client's campaign, we will work with the client to resolve the problems and may prevent further email campaigns until the problems are corrected. If Epsilon determines that a client has knowingly used its system for sending unsolicited commercial email, it will immediately revoke the client's permission to send email using our product or our system. 

Email user and other Internet user privacy is very important to Epsilon and our clients. The protection of consumers' information and privacy is a vital part of our business. 

Before companies can use Epsilon technology to send email, they must commit to us in writing that consumers have agreed to receive such email messages. 

Questions, concerns, comments and complaints can be addressed to [privacy@epsilon.com](mailto:privacy@epsilon.com). 

Epsilon is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. For more information on TRUSTe, please [click here](http://www.truste.org/). Because Epsilon wants to demonstrate its commitment to its clients and consumers' privacy, its privacy practices have been reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.

The collection of personal information by businesses is governed by Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995.

Epsilon enters into email marketing contracts with its clients in the EU which includes the processing of information relating to its customers. In these contracts, the EU client agrees and recognizes that it is the ‘data controller’ for the purposes of data protection legislation. This means that our EU client’s are responsible for complying with the data protection legislation in the relevant Member State national law before it sends its customer data to Epsilon for processing. Any data processed by Epsilon is only disclosed to third parties at the direction of its European client as the data controller, or when required by law. Any information that our EU clients identify as sensitive will be treated as such. 

Epsilon has a Privacy Administrator who is responsible for the internal supervision of Epsilon privacy policies and a team of technicians to handle data security. Epsilon educates its employees about compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles and has self-assessment procedures in place to ensure its compliance. [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/) serves as Epsilon's third-party dispute resolution provider. 

Epsilon participates in the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce. As part of our participation in the safe harbor, we have agreed to TRUSTe dispute resolution for disputes relating to our compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Framework. If you have any complaints regarding our compliance with the Safe Harbor you should first contact us at [privacy@epsilon.com](mailto:privacy@epsilon.com).
