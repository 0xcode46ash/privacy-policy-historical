# EPL Talk: Privacy Policy.

EPL Talk respects your right to privacy, and we've created this Customer Privacy Policy (our "Privacy Policy") to address these important issues. By visiting our Website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

We will collect and use personally identifiable information in the following ways: 

  * EPL Talk may track aggregate user information (rather than personally identifiable information) to help us improve the user experience. For example, we may track the aggregate number of keystrokes and length of time it takes for on-line users to locate a news article, so we can streamline and improve the web experience.
  * EPL Talkâ€™s Website contains links to other websites. We do not share your personal information with those websites and we are not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those other companies.
  * Our Website is not intended for, or directed to, anyone under the age of 13\. Any person who provides personal information to Good through any part of the Website represents that they are at least 13 years of age or older.
  * Other Important Uses: We may disclose personal information if required by applicable law, if we have a good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with legal process or public policy, or to protect the public, an individual's personal safety, or the property or interests of EPL Talk. Under such circumstances, we may be prohibited from providing notice of the disclosure, and we reserve the right not to provide such notice in our sole discretion. 
  * As our business evolves, EPL Talk may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including personal information, in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy.

**Choice**  
We want you to know that you can choose not to provide us with any information that identifies you personally. Each e-mail message that EPL Talk sends you for marketing purposes will give you the choice of "opting out" from receiving similar emails in the future. If you don't opt out from receiving such future emails, we'll assume that we can continue to contact you for marketing and related purposes. If you choose to provide us with information that identifies you personally, and you later want to change how we use that information, please let us know by sending an email to privacy@EPLtalk.com If you change your request regarding how we can use your personally identifiable information, we will honor your most recent request. Personal information you provide cannot currently be deleted entirely, but we will honor any request not to contact you further.

**Access and Accuracy**  
EPL Talk will use reasonable efforts to keep your personal information accurate. Please help us ensure that the information you provide is accurate and up-to-date, as it will help us serve you better. You can update your personally identifiable information by contacting us at privacy@EPLtalk.com 

**Security**  
EPL Talk has taken reasonable steps to secure the information you provide. For example, EPL Talk uses physical, electronic and administrative safeguards, including advanced firewall and password protection for our databases, which is designed to protect the security of data. 

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or if you believe that EPL Talk may not have followed this Privacy Policy, please contact us as soon as possible at privacy@EPLtalk.com and we will take commercially reasonable steps to address your issue. 

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we do, we will notify you of changes by posting a notice on our Website. The changes will become effective when posted, and your continued use of any of our services, or the Website will signify your acceptance of the new terms. If you do not accept the changes, please immediately discontinue use of our services and the Website. Please check back frequently to review our Customer Privacy Policy and to stay informed about how we treat personally identifiable information that we collect.

This Customer Privacy Policy is effective November 11, 2005.
