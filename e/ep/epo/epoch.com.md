# Epoch - Your Worldwide Billing Solution - Privacy Policy

  


#### PRIVACY POLICY

Online privacy is constantly evolving and Epoch plans to take all reasonable efforts to maintain up to date and effective online privacy standards and practices. We have linked every page of our website ("Website") to this page for your convenience and you may also contact us at [legal@epoch.com](mailto:legal@epoch.com) with any questions or concerns that you may have. 

Epoch is committed to respecting your online privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us. In order to provide payment processing, billing and fraud detection services, Epoch collects and uses your Personal Information. Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home, a credit card information, and Website passwords. This policy explains how we intend to treat your Personal Information. 

If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on our Website, we may transfer that Information within Epoch or to Epoch's third-party service providers, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. 

Epoch strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Epoch intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained. 

To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:

* Notice  
* Choice  
* Security  
* Access/Accuracy

##### NOTICE

You may access and browse our Website without disclosing any Personal Information.

Epoch uses a secure transmission method for all of its transmissions. Epoch receives and stores all information that you enter in our Website and billing pages. In addition, Epoch collects information about you during your visit, such as your IP Address and Epoch employs its software in order to ascertain your physical location when making a purchase. Except as set forth below, Epoch does not collect information from sources such as public records, or private organizations. However, Epoch does collect personal information you submit to its clients in order to complete transactions. You are required to provide Epoch and its clients with accurate and up to date information, and your failure to accurately provide such information could result in the voiding of your agreement(s) with Epoch.

**Information Use**  
Epoch is the sole owner of the information collected on its Website. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to Third Parties, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Epoch shall release data when required by law, to enforce its agreement(s) with you, or to enforce the contract rights of its clients.

**Information Sharing**  
We ensure that your Personal Information will not be disclosed to anyone other than a government institution or authority when required by law or other regulation, Epoch's affiliated merchant bank and card processors as required to process transactions on a credit card, and website owners/operators from which you are purchasing goods and services using Epoch ("Third Parties").

  


##### CHOICE

You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to Epoch. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of Epoch's Website, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you. If you chose to have a relationship with Epoch, such as a contractual or other business relationship or partnership, you will be required to provide Personal Information in connection with such relationship.

  


##### SECURITY

We have implemented security policies, rules and technical measures to protect the Personal Information that we have under our control from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, unlawful destruction or accidental loss. Epoch utilizes Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software when receiving and transmitting electronic payments. Epoch encrypts the sensitive information that you provide. Epoch reveals your credit card number when communicating on a private dedicated line of communication with our associated financial institution. 

In addition, Epoch protects your Personal Information off-line. All your information is restricted to our office. Security cards are used to enter our facility. All employees and data processors, who have access to and are associated with the processing of Personal Information, are obliged to respect the confidentiality of our visitors' Personal Information. Epoch conducts background and credit checks on all of its employees prior to employment. Epoch employs a User ID and password scheme in order to limit and achieve access to our computer network by our employees and Third Parties.

  


##### ACCESS/ACCURACY

**Accuracy**

To avoid any future persistent cookies being placed onto your hard drive from our Website you may set your browser to block cookies entirely or you may "opt out." In order for you to receive the opt out cookie(s) you will need to have JavaScript and cookies enabled in your browser. By receiving this cookie, our systems will know that you have opted out and will not attempt to assign other persistent cookies in the future.

Epoch is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites, including such websites' use of any information collected when you are directed to or click through to such websites. Even though such information might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of those websites.
