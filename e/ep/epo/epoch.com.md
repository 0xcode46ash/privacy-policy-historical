#### PRIVACY POLICY

Online and off-line privacy is constantly evolving and Epoch plans to take all reasonable efforts to maintain up to date and effective privacy standards and practices. You may also contact us at [legal@epoch.com](mailto:legal@epoch.com) with any questions or concerns that you may have.

Epoch is committed to respecting your privacy and recognizes the need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us. In order to provide payment processing, billing, customer service and fraud detection services (collectively "Services"), Epoch collects and uses your Personal Information.

If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information through our website ("Website") and/or through documents provided during your initial account setup and at any point thereafter, we may transfer your Personal Information within Epoch (its parent company and/or any subsidiaries) or to third parties, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Epoch strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Epoch intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.

To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:

* Notice  
* Choice  
* Security  
* Access/Accuracy  


##### NOTICE

**Information Collection And Use**

You may access and browse our Website without disclosing any Personal Information. However, if you attempt to retain Epoch's Services for your websites and/or to purchase a product or service online, Epoch may request that you voluntarily supply it with Personal Information. Personal Information we collect and how we use it is as follows:

  * **Registration information** \- When you sign up or use our Services, we ask for your personal information so that we can provide you with our Services. If you are a customer purchasing a product or service online using our Services, you may be required to provide your name, credit or debit card number, card expiration date, card verification code (CVV), address, username/password and email address. If you are a merchant or an affiliate of an Epoch merchant attempting to retain our Services for your websites, you may also be required to provide your bank account number, your personal address, your business details, and a government-issued identification number (for example, social security number or taxpayer identification number for U.S. residents). We may also ask you to send us additional documentation or to answer additional questions to help verify your information.
  * **Information obtained from third parties** \- In order to protect you from fraud or other misconduct, we may obtain information about you from third parties to verify the information you provide. For example, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your credit or debit card information and address match the information that you provided to us. Also, for merchants, we may obtain information about you and your business from a credit bureau or other sources such as public records or private business information services.
  * **Transaction information** \- When you use our Services to purchase a product or service online, we collect information about each transaction, including the transaction amount, a description of the goods or services being purchased, your name, username/password and the payment information.
  * **Log information** \- When you use our Services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
  * **User communications** \- When you send e-mail or other communication to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Services.



Epoch uses a secure transmission method for all of its transmissions. Epoch receives and stores all information that you enter/provide through our Website, e-mail, fascimile or regular mail. You are required to provide Epoch with accurate and up to date information, and your failure to accurately provide such information could result in the voiding of your agreement(s) with Epoch.

Epoch is the sole owner of the information collected. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to third parties, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We will not use any of your Personal Information to send you any promotional materials or advertisements. If you are a merchant or an affiliate of an Epoch merchant, you may from time to time receive from us important updates about our Services. If you are an affiliate of an Epoch merchant, you may also receive from us important updates about services of the Epoch merchant(s) for which you are an affiliate. If you are a customer, you may receive from us order/cancellation e-mail confirmations that are automatically generated whenever an order/cancellation is placed through us and that confirm your purchase or cancellation with important details about your purchase or cancellation, including but not limited to, product purchased/cancelled, order/cancellation date, username/password and our customer service toll free telephone number that may be used for any inquiries about the purchase/cancellation.

  * Epoch's merchant(s) from which you have purchased a product or service online using our Services;
