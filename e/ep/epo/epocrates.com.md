# ePocrates, Inc. - Privacy

Your privacy and sanity are very important to us. However your patient's well-being is also paramount and we want to make sure that you have the most up-to-date clinical drug reference guide available. 

As changes to our database become clinically significant, we feel it necessary to inform you of these updates as they may have significant implications for your patients. 

Ultimately, we promise not to send you annoying e-mails or Spam, nor will we sell your e-mail address to anyone who will.
