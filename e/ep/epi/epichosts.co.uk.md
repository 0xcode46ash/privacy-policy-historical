### Terms & Conditions

By placing an order with EpicHosts, in sole agreement upon transacting (once you press the 'Pay Now' button) and tick the agreement confirmation checkbox if applicible, you confirm that you are bound in agreement to the terms and conditions written below:

**General Terms & Conditions**

EpicHosts is relatively a non-profit busiess, used as a personal project for experience in hosting, businesses and handling customers. All monies received go to the founder of the project, staff and bills that maintain the company. Our servers are located in United Kingdom, Kent. 

The service is ran by [Ben Gough / Terrum](http://www.terrum.co.uk/), and solely by HIM, with no intention to move ownership at anytime or take responsibility for any impersonation that may be involved on phishing sites targeting our company. It is your responsibility to make sure you are at 'epichosts.co.uk' or 'www.epichosts.co.uk' for manual fraudulent checking so please check your address bar regularly.

Our security method is trusted with a DDoS mitigation and protection feature, related to any sorts of large attacks from many sources. It is setup to saturate uploads from many sources within a timeframe, then eventually block the sources. However, we are not responsible for any damage to your server or services, and we do not provide free backups of our services. Critical data of such should be kept in customers' safety for easy accessibility of having a backup of your service. Automatic backups can be provided with our services for an extra cost. If we find that your service is sending/receiving abusive packets, your account and service(s) will be terminated and your ISP may be notified. Any received attacks that are not properly taken care of by the customer, which are affecting our services, will also have to be suspended temporarily or terminated permanently.

The FTP Server is maintained by FileZilla, a highly secured and very lightweight server. For best use and compatibility, we recommend the [FileZilla Client](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) to connect to our FTP.

The VPS' we host are unmanaged, which means customers are not covered for troubleshooting or extended support. This includes network issues, misconfigurations, script/program installations and other sorts technical help within the third-party Operating System of the VPS. If you require this sort of assistance, contact us for a quote.

**Refunds**

This genuine host accepts a 7 day money-back guarantee, within reason. If you are not satisfied we may ask how we can improve our services to convince you of our true services that you may not have experienced, in case one has misunderstood or gotten frustrated. We may also use your information for future purposes to help improve our support of hosting. The decision to whether you are applicable to a refund is always down to the administrator.

The customer is responsible for the understanding of a service, and the necessity of a service. Once purchased, you abide these terms and funds are held with us until a proper agreement is made whether a refund should be processed.

A surcharge (processing fee) of 7% will be deducted from all refunds and transactions sent from us to a customer as per PayPal fees, setup fees and other charges that may have been used during the funding of the affected service.

Please note that VPS', Pre-installed services, Domain names, Domain transfers, SSL Certificates, Dedicated servers, Additional domains, Additional Databases, Backups, Dedicated application pools and/or any of the hosting addons/plan-upgrades are non-refundable. This is due to the funds being forwarded for promotional reasons, licenses, IP rental and other sorts of additions used within your process that are non-refundable to us.

**Payment**

If any payment required from a customer is not received by the due date, we acquire the full right to terminate your service and gain a lock of access to any service until it has been renewed or extended, therefore leaving the decision down to us whether content will be kept within a time period.

We are entitled to recover (on a full indemnity basis) any costs and charges (including legal costs) incurred in recovering any amounts owed by you to EpicHosts.

You acknowledge that should we not receive renewal payment prior to the date of expiry we reserve the right to suspend services immediately without notice. We may provide a 7 day grace period whereby we will hold your information and data on our servers, but should this period expire without payment we reserve the right to purge all data pertaining to your account with us.

Any interlinking services, such as Domains linked to Web Hosting, will be held by us until renewal, as an interlinked service no longer belongs to a customer after expiration.

Payments are controlled and serviced by PayPal. You do not need a PayPal account to purchase a service from us, however all payments received are held with us until complete satisfaction from the customer is approved, or until the service has expired or reached the money-back guarantee date. We will never demand a payment for the next cycle, as this is a non-subscription service.

**Server maintenance**

We might have, from time to time, to perform maintenance, upgrades or replacements of any hardware/software or content to our services and machines. We reserve the right to suspend access to any service during the required time to perform maintenance, upgrade or exchange the server, allowing us to quickly and safely finish the maintenance without any interruption or interference of a running service. Maintenance usually lasts no longer than 48 hours.

In this event, customers will be informed via e-mail of any planned maintenance. Any unplanned/planned maintenance will be posted on our [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/EpicHosts).

**Setup**

It is our responsibility to ensure that any applied hosting package application is completed and activated ready for full use. After completion, all our services are unmanaged unless agreed that managed support will be given. We will not be responsible for any misconfigurations or loss of data due to unauthorised exposure or accidental damage. Re-installations and re-services can be quoted by contacting us for a fee. Quoted times for account activation are estimates and we do not guarantee or imply activation within the quoted time frame. We may delay or refuse activation if:

\- Payment is not cleared or received in full,  
\- We believe the order, information or payment is fraudulent,  
\- You have any funds outstanding with relation to any other account,  
\- There is any other reason which we deem insatisfactory to our terms or beliefs, in which case we would explain within reason to you as soon as possible.

**Termination and Suspension**

You may terminate your hosting at any time by advising us via a method of contact that you wish to do so. We will only process a refund if we find it's applicible to your current service's state.

We may suspend any or all of your services where we have reason to suspect a violation of our terms and conditions whilst we investigate the suspected violation. We may suspend your services where we have reason to suspect that a script installed on your site is being abused whilst we investigate the suspected abuse.

**Violations**

If a customer violate our terms and conditions we may terminate or suspend (temporarily or indefinitely) any services you have with us. In this case no refund will be given for any payments that have been, or are made by you to us.

If we decide to change our terms, we will update accordingly along with the modification date below.
