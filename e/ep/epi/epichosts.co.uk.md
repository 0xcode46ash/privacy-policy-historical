Here is some information and Terms and Conditions you need to know before getting a server. The servers by Terrum are trustable and lag-less. The servers are hosted in United Kingdom in London. Please be aware that all servers are hackable and can easily be destroyed if you take no care in them. The FTPs are protected by CrossFTP and are highly unhackable. I am not responsible for any damage caused to the server or the files you upload. Any files infringing the law will be deleted immediately. Servers are usually only hacked if you annoy the hacker, But if your server got hacked for no apparent reason, Please contact me and give me their IP so I can ban them from accessing my IP, I use a ultimate firewall program to stop IPs from accessing my computer without permission. This host is fully genuine. We accept a 7 day full refund if you are not satisfied but only if you haven't had a trial. This is a non-commercial business and i'm not trying to make money from this, I just want to share servers and try out some servers that people make. But because of bills and stuff, I can't host them free anymore. This service is fully legal, Anything uploaded which infringing the law is not my responsibility. Please report to me if anything is found on the site what is illegal and further action will be taken immediately. That is the end of the Terms and Conditions for now. Thanks for reading and hope you understand it.

We have full right to close or suspend the server anytime if we think what you are doing with it is against our policy. This is a non-copyrighted service and for personal use only.

Payments are controlled and serviced by PayPal. You do not need a PayPal account to purchase a server. You will need a PayPal account to subscribe (automatically pay monthly). Payments will be notified as donations. The reason for that is so people don't have to sign up to PayPal to buy a server from me, If I use a buy button instead of a donate button, It says you must have a PayPal account.

As stated on every page in the footer, All content belongs to their rightful owners. I am not stealing anything; This site is non-commercial and is not selling any multimedia of the website. The only thing sold is private cheap hosting provided by Terrum himself.

This is not a subscription or a contract service. You can only get a refund if your service was paid for 7 days before you claim a refund. If you claim a refund after 7 days of paying, you will not get approved.
