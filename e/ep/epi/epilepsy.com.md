# Epilepsy.com | Privacy

We value and pledge to protect your privacy. Epilepsy.com is a PlanetRx.com website. The following policy applies to Epilepsy.com, PlanetRx.com, and all of PlanetRx's health channels. **TRUSTe certified**

[](https://www.truste.org/validate/2752) This confirms that PlanetRx is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, nonprofit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this website wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this website has agreed to notify you of:

  1. What personally identifiable information of yours or third-party personally identifiable information that is collected from you through the website 
  2. The organization collecting the information 
  3. How the information is used 
  4. With whom the information may be shared 
  5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information 
  6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under PlanetRx control

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact the PlanetRx.com privacy coordinator at [privacy@planetrx.com](mailto:mailto:privacy@planetrx.com).

TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with PlanetRx to resolve your concerns. **Our privacy philosophy**

At PlanetRx we are firmly committed to protecting your privacy. We understand that both medical and financial information is especially sensitive and that you may have concerns about sharing other personal information with us as well. We believe you should control the amount of information we receive about you. Where possible, we allow you to give as much or as little personal information to us as you feel comfortable providing.

We hope that you will want to provide information about yourself to PlanetRx, because it will make your experience here more valuable to you. If you are comfortable sharing some basic information, you will receive enhanced services that are impossible to offer to anonymous users. Examples of such services will include personalized tools for your prescription management, secure and private messaging with PlanetRx pharmacists, automatic reminders about refills, and an advanced system for customized drug information.

However you choose to interact with PlanetRx, you have our pledge to protect your privacy.

 **The security technology we use to protect your private information**

We use state-of-the-art technology to protect your data from unauthorized third parties. Currently PlanetRx uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to protect your data and secure your transactions. SSL encrypts all your personal information, including your credit card number, name and address as it is transmitted over the Internet. Read more in our [Security](https://web.archive.org/references/mainsite/help/security.html) section.

 **The information we gather** **When you visit a PlanetRx website ("cookies")**  
We gather traffic patterns and site usage information such as browser type, referring URL, and IP address, to help us develop the design and layout of the site and to personalize your shopping experience. This information is not linked to any personally identifiable information about you. As a standard practice, PlanetRx assigns a random number to each user to anonymously track content preferences and traffic patterns. This random number lets us keep track -- on an aggregate basis -- of how many times customers are doing specific things, like visiting our site each month, without specifically knowing who those customers are. This random number is kept in a file on your computer and is called a "cookie."

Cookies are used on PlanetRx websites to allow you to add items to your shopping cart and to log in to your account. Consequently, if you disable cookies in your Internet browser, you'll be able to browse the website to read content and look through all the pages of the site, but you won't be able to add items to your shopping cart, or take advantage of any of the services that require you to sign in to an account.

These cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the identity of any user. Unless you specifically tell us, PlanetRx will not know who you are. In some cases and from time to time, PlanetRx may have arrangements with third parties who provide or track usage of sponsored links that we believe may be of value to our customers. PlanetRx does not permit these third parties to collect personal information from our customers without the customers' explicit permission.

 **When you sign up for a PlanetRx account**  
To set up a basic PlanetRx account, you are asked to provide a unique user ID and password, your name, and your email address. When you create a PlanetRx account, we use information you provide to deliver personalized services, including customized product offerings, information, and special offers. You can create medical history profiles (as described above for filling a prescription) for everyone in your family, regardless of whether we have filled a prescription for them. These profiles allow us to provide personalized services for all your family members.

PlanetRx also conducts voluntary surveys from time to time to help us identify customer interests, and to allow for delivery of personalized information that will be most useful to you. Information collected on reader surveys may be shared with third parties to illustrate, on an aggregate basis only, profiles of PlanetRx users, but we will not individually identify you.

 **When you shop at PlanetRx**  
When you purchase nonprescription products from us, we collect your name, email address, credit card number and expiration date, phone number, and billing and shipping addresses.

When you fill a prescription with us, we collect all of the information stated above, as well as all the information that you would give to a neighborhood pharmacist: your prescribing doctor's name, your residential address, your gender and birth date, any drug allergies and existing medical conditions, and, if applicable, your insurance information (including your social security number). We also may ask for additional information, such as whether this is your first prescription for a particular medication. This lets us send you information we believe will help you on your new drug regimen.

 **How we use the information**

PlanetRx is always trying to provide you with a compelling reason to return to our site. We monitor customer traffic patterns and try to analyze what our customers like and don't like about our current offerings, so that we can design better services for you.

The personally identifiable information that you provide to us will be used to process your order (and, if applicable, your insurance payment for prescriptions) and to offer you a customized and valuable user experience, such as personalized special offers and relevant information, products, and services.

We have relationships with vendors such as Lens Express and Express Scripts who ship certain products ordered on PlanetRx directly to our customers. In these cases, we provide information necessary to fulfill your order, such as the items ordered, your name and your shipping address. We require these partners to adhere to PlanetRx's confidentiality standards and do not permit them to use our customer information for any other purposes.

If you have insurance coverage for your prescriptions, your insurance company or prescription benefit manager may have access to information about your orders so that they can process your benefits or assist you with your prescription orders, if necessary. This is in accordance with the terms of your health plan, and the information remains confidential.

We may share aggregate statistical information regarding our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and site usage with our partners. For example, we may develop summary, not individual, reports for our advertisers or sponsors. An example of a summary report might be "8,000 people clicked on Advertisement Z today and of those people, 25% had previously indicated they had an interest in diabetes." We never tell our partners who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements, unless you have specifically told us this is acceptable. We also may use this information in conjunction with generally available marketing databases so that we better understand our customers and can tailor our products, services and content to meet our customers' needs and preferences. This information is for PlanetRx use only and is never shared with third parties.

PlanetRx does, from time to time, contract with vendors to provide specific services to PlanetRx, such as data analysis, data storage, email processing, customer service, sweepstakes or promotion fulfillment. PlanetRx requires its vendors to adhere to PlanetRx's confidentiality standards and to destroy any customer data in their possession once the services are completed.

Except as explained in this policy, PlanetRx will not share your personal information with any third party without first receiving your permission, unless we believe in good faith that the law or professional duty requires it.

 **Receiving email**

PlanetRx will contact you by email when you register, to respond to any questions you may send us, if there is a problem with your order or insurance, and to remind you when your prescription medication is about to run out. (If there is a problem and we are not able to contact you by email, we may contact you by telephone.) We use email links on the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/references/mainsite/help/custserv.html) page of our website to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have. We read every message sent in and try to reply promptly to each one. The information you send is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments to improve the site, or review and discard the information. Your personal information will not be shared with third parties without your explicit permission.

If you are interested, we can also send you email communications to provide information which we think you will find useful, including announcements about new products and services from PlanetRx, sales alerts and newsletters on specific topics, as well as communications on behalf of third-party companies who offer products and services we think would be of value to you. It is our policy to send such email only to customers who explicitly give us permission do so. In every such email message, we will also have instructions on how to unsubscribe so that you will not receive any such messages from PlanetRx in the future if you do not wish to. You can also avoid receiving them altogether. See the following section.

 **Declining to receive email**

When you register with PlanetRx, you have the option to receive email with information which we think you will find useful, including announcements about new products and services from PlanetRx, sales alerts and newsletters on specific topics of interest to you, as well as communications on behalf of third-party companies who offer products and services we think would be of value to you. If you decide, at any time later that you would rather not receive such email, simply visit the Edit Account area of [My Account](https://web.archive.org/references/mainsite/member/home.asp) to change your preferences. If you do not want to receive prescription refill reminders, likewise choose the Edit Profile area of My Account.

 **Account revisions**

You may review, correct, update, or delete personal information that you provide to us at any time. All you have to do is go to the Edit Account, Edit Profile, and Edit Allergies Conditions areas of [My Account](https://web.archive.org/references/mainsite/member/home.asp) to review and/or edit the information. If you choose to delete your information, PlanetRx will not use it for any purpose except where required by applicable laws, regulations, or medical practice standards.

 **Public Forums**

PlanetRx provides public forums for our visitors to read and share information with other individuals. Disclosing personally identifiable information online through chat rooms, forums, and message boards makes the information submitted public information. Please be careful and use discretion when disclosing any information in such a public forum.

 **Advertising & links to other sites**

PlanetRx may have arrangements with third parties who provide advertising banners or sponsored links. PlanetRx does not permit these third parties to collect personal information from our customers without the customer's explicit permission. However, PlanetRx cannot control the activities of any third parties once a PlanetRx customer leaves a PlanetRx website. If you have questions about the privacy policies of such third parties, we suggest contacting them directly or visiting their websites to review their posted privacy policies. Currently, PlanetRx has arrangements with [L90](http://www.l90.com/external_site/privacy_policy.html).

 **Your consent**

By using a PlanetRx website and the services available to you on the site, you consent to our collection and use of your personally identifiable information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will notify you directly if there is a material change in our privacy practices. We will take commercially reasonable measures to obtain written or active e-mail consent from you if we are going to be using the personally identifiable information collected from you in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection.
