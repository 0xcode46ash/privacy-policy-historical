# Privacy Statement | epilepsy.com

## Introduction

The Epilepsy.com website located at www.epilepsy.com (the "Site") is owned by the Epilepsy Therapy Project. The Epilepsy Therapy Project ("we," "us," or "our") is strongly committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. Please carefully read the following Privacy Policy. 

Any person accessing, browsing or otherwise using this Site, either manually or via an automated device or program, shall be considered a "User." The purpose of this Privacy Policy ("Policy") is to explain the type of information that we collect from our Users, what we do with that information, and with whom we share this information. By accessing, browsing or using the Site, you agree that you fully understand and consent to this Privacy Policy and all other terms relevant to your use of our site, including our [Terms of Use](http://my.epilepsy.com/epilepsy/terms). 

## The Information We Collect

We may have access to the following categories of information regarding you and your visit to the Site. Only some of these categories of information identify you directly, but each category offers some information about your interests and activities that could be used to make inferences about you. 

**Personally Identifiable Information/Site Registration**

Epilepsy.com is designed so that you are not required to provide any personally identifiable information unless you are requesting access to certain features and services or you are voluntarily submitting personally identifiable information to us. Personally identifiable information may include a User's name, address, telephone number, credit card number, e-mail address and any other personal information that could be used to contact or identify you that you provide through the Site to us, our employees or agents, via e-mail or otherwise. This also includes personal information that you provide to us by mail, such as a donation. When this information is combined with any information about your health or medical condition, we refer to the resulting information as health-related personal information. 

The Site may allow you to register yourself to access certain pages or services. For example, the My Epilepsy Diary feature enables patients to register at our web site where they can create an individualized profile, which may include information relating to their experience with epilepsy including seizure episodes, medications and side effects. 

**Publicly Viewable Interactive Services Including Blogs, Chat Rooms, Community Forums**  
Any communication that you submit or that may be posted to any publicly viewable interactive feature such as blogs, chat rooms or other services is a public communication and may be viewed by the general public. Therefore, you acknowledge and understand that you have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in the content you submit to such services over our Site, whether or not it includes personally identifiable information about you. If you display your personally identifiable information in any communication or post submitted to such services or features, other individuals may collect and use your personally identifiable information. While we may remove personally identifiable information from posting to our Site, we assume no obligation to do so. We do not require you to disclose personally identifiable information in these forums, but apart from warning you to be prudent in your statements, we do not have the ability to control your disclosure of private information. We are not responsible for, nor can we guarantee the protection of, any personally identifiable information you disclose in a communication submitted to such services or features for posting or contained in an e-mail or other communication submitted to us for such posting, and thus you acknowledge that if you disclose personally identifiable information in any such material, you do so at your own risk. 

**Anonymous Browsing Information**

Users can browse the Site without revealing personal information.
