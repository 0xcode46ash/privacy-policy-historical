# EPIC - Privacy Policy

### Applicability of the GDPR

As of May 25, 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GPDR) is applicable to all entities that process European consumers’ personal data. You can read more about the GDPR here <https://epic.org/international/gdpr/>. EPIC is a strong supporter of the GDPR and believes that strong privacy standards should apply to everyone who uses online platforms and services no matter where they live. The GDPR helps to ensure that companies operate in an accountable and transparent manner, subject to the rule of law and the democratic process.

EPIC is committed to complying with all GDPR obligations for all personal data that it controls or processes. If you would like to exercise your data protection rights under the GDPR, you can contact us at [privacy-request@epic.org](mailto:privacy-request@epic.org). EPIC has also made the full text of the GDPR accessible through its Privacy Law Sourcebook here <https://epic.org/bookstore/pls2016/>. Contact information for European data protection authorities can be found [here](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm).
