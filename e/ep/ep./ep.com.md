# Privacy

EPage® has created this privacy statement in order to  demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.  The following discloses our  information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: ep.com.

If you take out an ad on EPage® or become an affiliate we use cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit a password-protected page on our site (such as your account management).

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and unique identifiers (like their social security number).  The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary.  Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.  Unique identifiers (such as social security numbers) are collected for use as account numbers in our record system.

For affiliate relationships, Social Security Numbers may be used to report income to the appropriate governemnt authorities.
