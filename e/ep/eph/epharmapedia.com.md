# Privacy policy | ePharmaPedia

**Introduction...**  
The internet is an amazing tool that has the ability to change our lives. It serves all intellectuals no matter their interests.

It is available to everyone, not just for professionals; everyone can browse and benefit from the information found on our website. When it comes to our services, communicating with the members of our website and meeting their needs and desires is quite important, but to do this, we need to know their personal and contact information so that we’ll be able to serve them better.
