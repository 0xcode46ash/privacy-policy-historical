#### We Protect Your Right to Privacy

Eurojobs.com is vigilant about protecting your privacy. As an on-line recruitment company, we understand better than most the need for you to maintain control over your personal data when using the Internet. We maintain your privacy through the enforcement of strict internal polices that exceed industry standards. We try to be as transparent as possible, so you can always see and act upon what is being done with your data. Our guidelines for protecting the information you provide us during a visit to our Web site appear below. 

#### Privacy Statement

This statement discloses the privacy practices for www.Eurojobs.com. We have designed Eurojobs.com so that no personal identifying information is displayed online or is accessible to the general public. 

#### What Information We Gather/Track

We collect and store some or all of the following information about our users: name; email address; and billing information, such as address, phone number and CV details. Eurojobs does not store credit card details. We also receive and may store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Eurojobs.com. In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our services, and more detailed contact preferences. You will have the option of choosing not to provide us with this information. 

#### Use of Data

Eurojobs.com uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, including fulfillment of promotional offers, to communicate back to you, to update you on service and benefits, to personalize our web sites for you, and to manage and renew your subscription(s). Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and fraud protection, and are not used for other purposes without your permission. 

#### Web Applications

Certain online applications, such as the various elements of the Eurojobs.com, store some components on your hard drive. The software employs proprietary technology to scan your computer system and retrieve information regarding your installed software and hardware. The information that is retrieved is used to provide the services you have chosen to subscribe to or use. In addition, unless you indicate you do not want this service, the information will be used to generate advertising that is appropriate for you. The information gathered by these applications is used only to generate output directed to you and is not aggregated or used for any other purpose. It is not stored along with any identifying information about you, nor is it sold, rented, or shared with any outside parties in any form whatever. 

#### Use of Your Email Address

If you provide us with your email address when you register as a customer or make a purchase from us, we will occasionally send you email with recommendations or notices of new products, prices, and services. This email may include paid advertisements from third parties. You may block future email of this type, simply by following the instructions at the bottom of the update messages. Separately, we send service notifications via email to keep you informed about the status of your service orders or accounts and to provide updates and technical notices. These messages are essential to the maintenance of your subscription and the functionality of our services. Therefore there is no opt-out available for service notifications and these messages cannot be blocked. 

#### Who We Share It With

Eurojobs.com will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide online with other Eurojobs.com entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described in "Terms of Use". By contract, third parties must comply with their own privacy policies with regard to the renting, selling, or sharing of information. As partners of Eurojobs.com, they must also offer Eurojobs.com customers the chance to opt out of information sharing. For advertising purposes, visitor and customer information is statistically aggregated and reported to advertisers. However, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you, such as your name, email address, account, password, or transaction history. 

#### Links

Eurojobs.com contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are 'clicking' to another Web site. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites, as their privacy policies may differ from ours. 

#### Log Files

Eurojobs.com maintains log files of the traffic that visits the Eurojobs.com site. We do not link any information gathered in these log files to personally identifying information. Log files are used to manage traffic loads and information technology requirements for providing reliable service. Information collected includes IP addresses and browser types. 

#### Feedback

We collect user feedback. We do not typically respond to user feedback in the form of email. We do collect testimonials that appear on the site from our feedback form, but only after we have obtained permission from the senders. Users who would like a response to specific questions concerning the service or their subscriptions are directed to the customer service area. These questions will be answered as quickly as possible. We read all of our customer service queries and use the information contained therein only to resolve the question at hand. We also post surveys on our site, ranging from one to ten questions. These surveys are optional and all information is collected anonymously. The information is collected to better understand our user population. It is not sold or transferred to any third party.
