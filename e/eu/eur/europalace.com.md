We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy carefully and use it to make informed decisions. By using our Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and your continued use of the Services constitutes your ongoing agreement to this Privacy Policy.

## What type of information we collect

We collect two types of data and information from our users.

The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a user(s), which may be made available or gathered via your use of the Services (“ **Non-personal Information** ”). We are not aware of the identity of the user from which the Non-personal Information was collected. Non-personal Information which is being collected may include your aggregated usage information and technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information (e.g. the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time and the domain name of the website from which you linked to the Services; etc.), in order to enhance the functionality of our Services. We may also collect information on your activity on the Services (e.g. pages viewed, online browsing, clicks, actions, etc.).

The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“ **Personal Information** ”). When you use our Services, you will be asked to provide Personal Information to us.

The Personal information we collect through our Services includes information which is submitted directly by the user, such as: full name; e-mail address; home address; date of birth; phone number; payment means (e.g. credit card number); and other financial information that we may need in order to provide our Services.

We may also collect Personal Information from your device (e.g. IP address) and your device’ unique identifiers (e.g. MAC addresses, UUID, etc.).

If we combine Personal Information with Non-personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.

## How we collect information

There are three main methods we may use to collect information:

  * We collect information which you provide us voluntarily. For example, we collect Personal Information which you provide when you respond to communications from us, open an account and use the Services, etc.
  * We collect information through your use of the Services. In other words, when you are using our Services, we are aware of it and may gather the information relating to such usage, either independently or through the help of third-party services as detailed below.
  * We collect information through our trusted third-party service providers, such as information about your credit history and other financial information which is relevant to our Services, as well as information which is gathered in order to conduct anonymous analytics, verify your identity or prevent fraudulent or illegal activity.



## Cookies and Google Analytics

We and our trusted partners use cookies and other technologies in our related services, including when you visit our site or access our Services.

A "cookie" is a small piece of information that a website assign to your device while you are viewing a website. Cookies are very helpful and can be used for various different purposes. These purposes include allowing you to navigate between pages efficiently, enable automatic activation of certain features, remembering your preferences and making the interaction between you and our Services quicker and easier. Cookies are also used to help ensure that the advertisements you see are relevant to you and your interests and to compile statistical data on your use of our Services.

Our website uses the following types of cookies:

  * **'session cookies'** which are stored only temporarily during a browsing session in order to allow normal use of the system and are deleted from your device when the browser is closed;
  * **'persistent cookies'** which are read only by our website, saved on your computer for a fixed period and are not deleted when the browser is closed. Such cookies are used where we need to know who you are for repeat visits, for example to allow us to store your preferences for the next sign-in;
  * **'third party cookies'** which are set by other online services who run content on the page you are viewing, for example by third party analytics companies who monitor and analyze our web access.



Cookies do not contain any information that personally identifies you, but Personal Information that we store about you may be linked, by us, to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. You may remove the cookies by following the instructions of your device preferences; however, if you choose to disable cookies, some features of our Service may not operate properly and your online experience may be limited.

We also use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about your use of the Services. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users access the Services, what pages they visit when they do so, etc. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Services. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit sites, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).
