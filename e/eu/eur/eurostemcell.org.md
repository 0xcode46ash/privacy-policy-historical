[More about cookies](http://www.eurostemcell.org/privacy-cookies#cookies).

### IP addresses

We may collect information where available about your IP address, operating system and browser type.  This is data about users' browsing actions and patterns.  It is used to inform improvements to the website, for system administration, and to report aggregate information to third parties.

### Security

We employ security measures to protect your information from access by unauthorised persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is never completely secure.  Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal or other data transmitted to our website.  Any transmission is at your own risk.  Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access.

### Your rights

You have the right to ask for a copy of the information held by us in our records in return for which we charge a small fee. 

If any information held by us is incorrect, you have the right to ask for this to be corrected and updated.  Please help us keep our records updated by informing us of any changes to your email address and other contact details. 

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.  We will usually inform you (before collecting your personal data) if we intend to use your personal data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes.  You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your personal data.  You can also exercise the right at any time by [contacting us](http://www.eurostemcell.org/contact).

### Third party websites

The website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of third parties. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.  Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these third party websites.

**How we use your information, how it is stored and the circumstances under which we disclose data.**

We use your information to:

We may contact you by post, telephone or fax as well as by email and text message. If you change your mind about being contacted in the future by any of these means then please let us know by [getting in touch with us](http://www.eurostemcell.org/contact).

### Storage of your information

Transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to the website.  Any transmission is at your own risk.  Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access.

### Passwords

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the website, you are responsible for keeping this password safe and confidential.  You must not share a password with anyone.

### Disclosure of your information

We will not share, sell or distribute any of the information you provide to us without your consent, except where disclosure is:

  * necessary to enforce our rights, including under our website [Terms and Conditions](http://www.eurostemcell.org/terms-and-conditions) of use; or
  * required or permitted by law.



Authorised personnel within the University will be able to access the information you provide to us.  We may also disclose your information to other third parties who act for us for the purposes set out in the policy.

### Outside the European Economic Area

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").  It may also be processed by staff or by other third parties operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers, agents, or partners.  By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.

Please note that countries outside the European Economic Area do not always have the same data protection obligations as we do.  However, we will take steps to ensure that your information is used by third parties securely and in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy.

## Our use of cookies

**We use several types of cookies for a range of reasons across the website.  Some are essential, while others you can opt out of or block.  Opting out or blocking some cookies may affect the functionality of the website.**

### Why and how we use cookies

Like many websites, we sometimes place small data files on your computer. These files are known as cookies.

They improve things by:

  * remembering settings, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you visit a new page
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested
  * measuring how you use the website so we can make sure it meets your needs



These cookies are placed on your device either by EuroStemCell or by the third parties whose services we use as part of the website.

Some cookies are retained in your browser for only as long as you visit our website, while others persist for a longer specified or unspecified period.
