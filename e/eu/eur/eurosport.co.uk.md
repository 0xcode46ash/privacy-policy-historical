**Yahoo! Privacy and Cookie Policy**

[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.yahoo.com&sealid=101) Yahoo! takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy and cookie policy. 

**What this Privacy and Cookie Policy Covers**  


  * This Privacy Policy covers Yahoo!'s treatment of personally identifiable information that Yahoo! collects when you are on the Yahoo! site, and when you use Yahoo!'s services. This policy also covers Yahoo!'s treatment of any personally identifiable information that Yahoo!'s business partners share with Yahoo!. 
  * The policy also gives information about cookies; Yahoo! and third parties' use of cookies; and how you may disable such cookies. 
  * This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Yahoo! does not own or control, or to people that Yahoo! does not employ or manage. 
  * This privacy policy incorporates, where applicable, any additional guidance about our privacy practices relating to particular products or services that can be found under the section "More about Yahoo! Privacy" on the top left of this page. 
  * Find out more information about Yahoo! [data storage](http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/uk/archives/details.html) and [data transfer](http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/uk/access/details.html).  


**Information Collection and Use**  


  * Yahoo! collects personally identifying information when you register for a Yahoo! account, when you use certain Yahoo! products or services, when you visit Yahoo! pages, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. 
  * When you register with Yahoo!, we ask for your name, email address, birth date, gender, post code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register with Yahoo! and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. 
  * Yahoo! also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your [IP address](https://web.archive.org/privacy/uk/ip/details.html), Yahoo! [cookie](https://web.archive.org/privacy/uk/cookies/details.html) information and the page you requested. 
  * Yahoo! uses information for three general purposes: to customise the advertising and content you see, based on the details given by you at registration and your activity at Yahoo!, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to contact you about specials, new products and for customer feedback. 

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  


  * Yahoo! will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. 
  * Yahoo! may send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when: 
    * We have your consent to share the information; 
    * We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; 
    * We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Yahoo! to provide a product or service to you; (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.); 
    * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, any legitimate request by authorities with which we must comply or legal process. 
    * Yahoo! may transfer information about you if Yahoo! acquires, or is acquired by or merged with, another company. In this event, Yahoo! will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
**Cookies**  

    * Yahoo! may set and access Yahoo! [cookies](https://web.archive.org/privacy/uk/cookies/details.html) on your computer. 
    * Yahoo! allows [other companies](https://web.archive.org/privacy/uk/adservers/details.html) that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Yahoo!'s cookies. 
    * Yahoo! uses [web beacons](https://web.archive.org/privacy/uk/pixels/details.html) to access our cookies within our network of web sites, in connection with Yahoo! products and services and to track your activities on our advertisers websites. 

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. 

Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. 

Find out more about [cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/). 

**Choices about Cookies**  


    * You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) 
    * If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Yahoo! products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings. However, many Yahoo! products and services do not require that you accept cookies.
**Yahoo!'s Practices Regarding Cookies**

Yahoo! uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to: 

    * Access your information when you "sign in," so that we can provide you with customised content, such as My Yahoo!. 
    * Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using Yahoo!'s services. 
    * Display the most appropriate advertising banners, based on your interests submitted by you at registration and activity including pages viewed on Yahoo!. 
    * Assist merchants in Yahoo! Shopping to process the items in your shopping cart. 
    * Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic. 
    * Conduct research to improve Yahoo!'s content and services. 
    * Require you to re-enter your Yahoo! password after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents.
**Other Companies' Cookies on Yahoo!**  

    * Please note that Yahoo! allows [other companies](https://web.archive.org/privacy/uk/adservers/) that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. 
    * Advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the [Yahoo! Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy/uk/). 

**Disabling/Enabling Cookies**

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features of our site if cookies are disabled.

**Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences**  


      * Yahoo! gives you the ability to edit your [Yahoo! Account Information](http://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_profile) and preferences at any time, including whether you want Yahoo! to contact you about specials, new products and for customer feedback. 
      * You may request deletion of your Yahoo! account by visiting our [Account Deletion](https://edit.yahoo.com/config/delete_user) page, verifying your password once more and confirming your choice to terminate the account. Please [click here](http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/uk/archives/details.html) to read about what information may possibly remain in our archived records after your account has been deleted.
**Confidentiality and Security**  

      * We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. 
      * We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you. 
      * To learn more about security, including the security steps we have taken and security steps you can take, please read [Security at Yahoo!](http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/uk/security/details.html). 
**Changes to this Privacy Policy**  

      * Yahoo! may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages. 
**Questions or Suggestions**  

      * If you have questions or suggestions complete a [feedback form](http://help.yahoo.com/fast/help/uk/privacy/cgi_feedback). 
      * [Yahoo! is TRUSTe-certified](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.yahoo.com&sealid=101). This certification applies to all English-language sites under the Yahoo.com domain. If you feel that your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php), an independent privacy organization.
