**The Return of the Cheapos**   
Tom, Kari and Marina, our three undercover editors, recently returned (4/26) from Spain where they checked out over 300 hotels in Barcelona and Madrid. 

We posted over 40 new Barcelona reviews on May 7, and 40 Madrid reviews on May 21. Olé! 

**WHAT IS THIS?**   
EuroCHEAPO is the free Internet guide to sleeping cheap in Europe. We want one thing: to find the best cheap hotels and discounted hotels in Paris. 

EuroCHEAPO investigators show up unannounced at hotels all over Europe, check out the rooms, check out the prices, and get a feel for the place. 

If we like it, we snap a photo, write a (sometimes sassy) review, and list the hotel on our site. Plus we give you full, up to date information, so that you can book a room immediately. 

We want you to find the best hotels for your budget in Europe. 

EuroCHEAPO-Sleep Smart. Sleep Cheap.
