**euroCHEAPO News**   
Thursday, Jan. 30, 2020 NEW! **EuroCheapo Poll!**   
What city would you like to see EuroCheapo add next? We need your advice! **[VOTE](https://web.archive.org/listings/)**

**Enfin! Paris Reviews!**   
We recently returned from Paris and have just updated _ALL_ of our [Paris reviews](https://web.archive.org/paris/). We've added 12 new hotels, dropped five, and rewritten 40! 

**Watch out, Vienna!**   
Our editors are packing their bags again and getting ready for our November trip to Vienna, Salzburg, and Hamburg! New reviews (and new cities!) by New Years! 

**Driving Concerns**   
On our last trip to Italy, we paid too much for our rental car. Now we've done our homework and figured out the best deals for [renting a car in Europe](https://web.archive.org/cars/). 

**What is This?**   
EuroCheapo is the free Internet guide to sleeping cheap in Europe. We want one thing: to find the best cheap hotels and discounted hotels in Paris. 

EuroCheapo investigators show up unannounced at hotels all over Europe, check out the rooms, check out the prices, and get a feel for the place. 

If we like it, we snap a photo, write a (sometimes sassy) review, and list the hotel on our site. Plus we give you full, up to date information, so that you can book a room immediately. 

We want you to find the best hotels for your budget in Europe. 

EuroCheapo-Sleep Smart. Sleep Cheap.
