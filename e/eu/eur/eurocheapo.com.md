_**NEWSFLASH!**_  
EuroCheapo featured by Arthur Frommer in "Budget Travel," January 30, 2005: "But most important, there's Eurocheapo.com, whose primary function is to reveal the whereabouts of budget-priced hotels in scores of European cities." 

**What is EuroCheapo?**   
EuroCheapo is the free Internet guide to cheap hotels in Europe. 

EuroCheapo investigators show up unannounced at budget hotels all over Europe, check out the rooms, and get a feel for the place. 

If we like the hotel, we write a review and list it on our site, with full contact information, so that you can book a room immediately. 

Our goal is to help you find the best hotels for your budget. Welcome! 

**Baby It's Cold Outside!**   
But that's why we travel! Warm your spirits planning a romantic Valentine's getaway or defeat winter doldrums by simply getting out of town. No excuses necessary. 

Whether you plan to propose in Paris or party in Prague this winter, smart Cheapos know that booking ahead means big savings. Have fun! 

**Driving Concerns**   
On our last trip to Italy, we paid too much for our rental car. Now we've done our homework and figured out the best deals for [renting a car in Europe](https://web.archive.org/cars/).
