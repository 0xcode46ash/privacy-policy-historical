**EXTRA! EXTRA!**  
 **EuroCHEAPO chosen as the "Site to See" by The New York Times on Sunday, October 12th!**   "Offers pointed descriptions of budget lodgings in Europe's major cities. Hotels (about 25 per city) are visited by the editor of the site, and are re-evaluated every 12 to 18 months." **WHAT IS THIS?**   
EuroCHEAPO is the free Internet guide to sleeping cheap in Europe. We want one thing: to find the best cheap hotels and discounted hotels in Paris. 

EuroCHEAPO investigators show up unannounced at hotels all over Europe, check out the rooms, check out the prices, and get a feel for the place. 

If we like it, we snap a photo, write a (sometimes sassy) review, and list the hotel on our site. Plus we give you full, up to date information, so that you can book a room immediately. 

We want you to find the best hotels for your budget in Europe. 

EuroCHEAPO-Sleep Smart. Sleep Cheap.
