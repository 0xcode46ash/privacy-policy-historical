### E-mails

European Voice uses reputable third parties to deliver the e-mails you receive if you have subscribed to e-mail newsletters, or have chosen to receive information about European Voice products, services and offers. These third parties use unique identifiers and invisible images (often called "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") to perform message open sensing, message format sensing, and click-through sensing in order to bring you more relevant information.

To find out more about the technologies used in these e-mails sent on our behalf, please visit <http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx>. Content and some ad services in these e-mails are provided by European Voice servers or by a third party.

### Advertisements

European Voice uses DoubleClick to deliver the advertisements displayed on our websites. DoubleClick may note some of the pages you visit through the use of pixel tags (also called "clear gifs"). In the course of serving advertisements to this site, DoubleClick may place or recognise a unique cookie on your computer in order to bring to you more relevant information and to make sure that you do not receive the same ad many times in the same session. Some of the advertisers on our sites do not use DoubleClick ad-serving software and their ads are served by third-parties who may also place cookies. To find out more about these sensing methods and to know your choices about not having this information used by DoubleClick, please visit <http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx>.

### External links

Our websites may, from time to time, contain links to external sites. European Voice is not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites and we recommend that you read the privacy policies on any external sites you use.

### Security policy

European Voice does its utmost to protect your privacy and ensure your personal details are not misused, accidentally destroyed, lost or altered within European Voice.

Occasionally we share your details with other companies who are managing data for us (eg fulfilment bureaux, database consultants etc.). They are only permitted to process your data with explicit permission from European Voice, enabling them to perform the services required.

### Transfer of personal data overseas

As the internet is a global environment, collecting and processing personal information may involve the transmission of this data internationally, including outside of the European Union. Therefore, by communicating electronically with us you acknowledge and agree to your personal data being processed in this way.

### Children under 13

European Voice does not intentionally collect any personal information from individuals under the age of 13. When necessary, underage users will be told not to submit any personal details and we will make every effort to delete any details of such users where a parent or guardian has informed us that these details have been collected.

### Changes to this statement

From time to time, we may make changes to the privacy policy. This may be in relation to changes in the law, best practice or changes in our services. These changes will be reflected in this statement, so you should check here from time to time.
