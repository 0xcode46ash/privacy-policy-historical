# European Voice | Privacy policy

EuropeanVoice.com is committed to protecting the privacy of European Voice subscribers. This statement outlines our privacy and data privacy policy. 

Third party partners and other websites you may access via this website have different privacy policies and are not subject to this privacy statement.

Collection and Use of User Details  
Personal details of users of EuropeanVoice.com will be collected from the website's order and registration forms and processed upon registration to our website. 

When you visit the site, we also collect web site usage information and information about your computer and internet connection, including your computer's IP address, the type and version of browser and operating system you use, your internet domain and, if you arrived at EuropeanVoice.com via a link from another website, the URL of the linking page.

All personal information is collected with the knowledge of users of EuropeanVoice.com via the website's order and registration forms only. This information is collected for the following purposes: 

  * order fulfilment 
  * to notify users of relevant new products and features 
  * to notify users of promotional activities both within European Voice and across The Economist Group of companies depending on your preferences 
  * personalise the content and advertising you will see based on your personal characteristics or preferences 
  * [allow reputable third parties to send you information (if you opt in to receiving such information)] 
  * ensure, as far as is practical, that our site is compatible with the browsers and operating systems used by most of our visitors.  
If you do not wish to receive information about our products or services or information from other organisations about products or services offered by them, please tick the appropriate box on the registration or order form. However, we may disclose your information to business partners and third party suppliers we engage to provide services which involve processing data on our behalf. 
  * User information is retained for in-house research to: 
  * improve our understanding of customer needs and product development 
  * build marketing profiles 
  * aid strategic development 
  * manage our relationship with advertisers  
All results of such research and analysis will be anonymised or aggregated information and will not reveal any personal facts about individual customers.



European Voice is part of The Economist Group which operates from offices worldwide. Steps have been taken to ensure that consistently high standards of data privacy are adhered to in all our offices for all the forms of processing mentioned above.

## User Preferences

All registration and order forms provide users with a series of choices as regards further promotional activity, forms of communication and third party processing.  When filling out order or registration forms on EuropeanVoice.com users should indicate whether they are receptive to the use of e-mail to inform them of further European Voice promotional literature.  You may also indicate whether you wish to receive such information from other Economist Group businesses.

[We may occasionally allow other similar but reputable organisations which may be of interest to contact you. If you don't wish to hear from these companies, please tick the appropriate box on the order/registration form to opt out of such activity.] 

## Cookies

A cookie is a small file which is placed on the user's hard drive during an EuropeanVoice.com visit. This file allows the user to move quickly and easily around our site. It is used to identify returning users and to identify subscribers and registrants (a registrant - and subscriber - will have the cookie linked to their e-mail address as a way of identifying them). This means that if you are a registrant or subscriber, you will not have to login each time you visit. We also use a cookie to track a user's sessions. We use this information to find out what site features are most popular so that we can develop EuropeanVoice.com in the light of our analysis of people's usage. We may also use cookies and the information we collect to show you relevant content and advertising. You can delete cookies from your hard drive at any time. Bear in mind, though, that if you delete these cookies, any settings such as your stored username and password will have to be reset when you log in again. 

[Unlike many sites, you will be able to use EuropeanVoice.com even if you set your browser not to accept any cookies. However, certain features and content may not be available to you and you will have to log in every time you visit. ]

Further information on the use of cookies can be found at: [www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/).

## E-mails   


EuropeanVoice.com uses reputable third parties to deliver the e-mails you will receive from our site if you subscribe to our e-mail newsletters or have chosen to receive information about EuropeanVoice products and offers. These third parties use unique identifiers and invisible images (often called "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") to perform message open sensing, message format sensing, and clickthrough sensing on behalf of EuropeanVoice.com in order to bring you more relevant information. 

To find out more about these technologies as used in the e-mails sent on behalf of EuropeanVoice by DoubleClick Inc., please click here. Content and some ad services in these e-mails are provided by EuropeanVoice.com or another third party ad server.

## Adverts 

EuropeanVoice.com uses DoubleClick to deliver the advertisements that are placed within the site. DoubleClick may note some of the pages you visit on our site through the use of pixel tags (also called "clear gifs"). In the course of serving advertisements to this site, DoubleClick may place or recognise a unique "cookie" on your computer on behalf of EuropeanVoice.com in order to bring to you more relevant information and in order to make sure that you do not receive the same advert many times in the same session. Some of the advertisers on EuropeanVoice.com do not use DoubleClick advert-serving software and their adverts are served by third-parties who may place cookies. To find out more about these sensing methods and to know your choices about not having this information used by DoubleClick, please click here.]   
Security Policy or Security Guarantee  
European Voice aims to maintain appropriate measures to ensure that users' personal details are not misused, accidentally destroyed, lost or altered within the European Voice server environment. All personal data is encrypted for transmission over the Internet to our server(s).

Occasions will arise when customer information is passed outside The Economist Group to other data processors e.g. fulfilment bureaux and database consultants but these will only be authorised to act upon instruction from European Voice in order to perform the services required.

## Transfer of Personal Data Overseas

Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis, both within and outside the European Economic Area. Therefore, by browsing the European Voice sites and communicating electronically with us you acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal data in this way. 

## Updating Customer Details

It is important to us that we have your correct contact information so that you don't miss out on further correspondence or experience problems with the delivery of products. To notify us of any changes simply send your new details, along with your old details to [evsubscriptions@europeanvoice.com](mailto:evsubscriptions@europeanvoice.com).

## Children Under 13  


European Voice does not intentionally collect any personally identifiable information from individuals under the age of 13. When necessary, underage users will be told not to submit any personal details and we will make every effort to delete any details of such users where a parent or guardian has informed us that these details have been collected. 

## Changes to this statement

Due to changes in legislation and best practice or enhancements to functionality and content on EuropeanVoice.com we may make changes to our privacy policy and will reflect those changes in this statement, so you should check here from time to time.
