If that happens, Euromonitor would require them to use your information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.  
If Euromonitor does give your information to the third parties set out above, Euromonitor will always require they adhere to the same security procedures that Euromonitor follows itself.

**4.  LEGAL REQUESTS  
**Euromonitor may need to disclose personal information to protect Euromonitor and Euromonitor’s licensors’ rights and property or to comply with any applicable law or valid legal process.

**5.  TRANSFER OF INFORMATION OUTSIDE EEA

5.2. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. Euromonitor will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**6.  AGGREGATED INFORMATION  
**Euromonitor may share non-personal aggregated statistics data about visitors to the Site and sales and traffic patterns with our partners and other third parties. Just to be clear, this information does not identify users in any personal capacity; it just gives generalised information about the users of the Site.

**7.  COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKED INFORMATION  
**7.1. While on the Site, certain information is automatically logged about how you are using the Site. This information may include the URL of the website which linked you to the Site, your IP address and the pages you visit while on the Site. The IP address indicates the location of your computer on the internet. IP addresses are not used to track your session and are not linked to anything personally identifiable.  
7.2. A feature known as a cookie is also used. A cookie is a small data file that resides on your computer which allows Euromonitor to recognise you as a user when you return to the Site using the same computer and web browser. The cookies and other automatically tracked information are used: 

  * to identify repeat visitors; 
  * to personalise your experience on the Site; 
  * to help Euromonitor better understand how users use the Site so that it can administer, support and improve the Site and the services that Euromonitor offers; 
  * to contact you for the purpose of confirming your registration details in the event that you forget your password. 



7.3. Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to refuse cookies or to notify you when you have received one. If you want to stop cookies being stored on your computer in future, please refer to your browser manufacturer's instructions by clicking "Help" in your browser menu. Further information on deleting or controlling cookies is available at [www.AboutCookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/). If you reject cookies though, the Site will not recognise you and so will not retain any information you have input (for example, in your ‘Shopping Cart’). 

**8.  LINKS  
**The Site contains links to third party websites that are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Euromonitor strongly recommends that you read the privacy policy of any such websites that you visit.

**9.  SECURITY  
**9.1. As required by UK Data Protection law, Euromonitor follows strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given to Euromonitor, to prevent unauthorised access. In particular, Euromonitor uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encode your personal information. SSL encrypts your contact details and your password as it travels through the Internet. Encryption creates billions of code combinations to protect each transaction made on the Site, so your details cannot be viewed by anyone else using the internet.  
9.2. Despite using this technology, Euromonitor cannot guarantee the security of the information that you disclose to Euromonitor. You accept the inherent risks of providing information and dealing on-line and will not hold Euromonitor responsible for any breach of security unless this is due to Euromonitor’s negligence or wilful default.  
9.3. If you have any concerns about security, please email Euromonitor at [info@euromonitor.com](mailto:info@euromonitor.com).

**10.  UPDATING ACCOUNT INFORMATION  
**If you want to update or change your registration information, please e-mail Euromonitor at [info@euromonitor.com](mailto:info@euromonitor.com) and we will update your account details.

**11.  RIGHT TO SEE YOUR INFORMATION  
**Under the Data Protection Act 1998 you have the right to see the personal information that Euromonitor holds about you, whether collected through your use of the Site or through any communications that you have had with Euromonitor. You will need to provide Euromonitor with a detailed written request and pay a small fee. If you have any queries about your right or wish to make such a request, please contact Euromonitor by e-mail at [info@euromonitor.com](mailto:info@euromonitor.com) or by post addressed to the Privacy Officer, Euromonitor International Plc., 60-61 Britton Street, London EC1M 5UX.

**12.  POLICY CHANGES  
**Euromonitor may change this Privacy Policy at any time by sending you an e-mail with the modified Privacy Policy or by posting a copy of them on the Site. Any changes will take effect seven (7) days after the date of our e-mail or the date on which Euromonitor posts the modified Privacy Policy on the Site, whichever is the earlier. Your continued use of the Site after that period expires means that you agree to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.
