"That Topshot online slot very nice. I like it very much that I can also play for free. I almost can't keep my hands off it. Made wonderfully, my compliments" 

"Perfect service! My PC crashed and I thought 'credits're gone'. But when I restarted my PC and opened the game again, all my credits were back where they belong to" 

"Thanks for the fast payout of my won prize. I doubted somewhat whether it'd all be trustworthy, but the amount was on my account the next day. I will surely be back sometime to play your slot machines again." 

"I used to play these kind of slots in the pub in the old days. But since I am bound to be at home most of my time because of a serious accident, that fun is a past time. Your Clubgold slot game looks and plays almost like the real one. I have won several times already and always receive my money in time. Thanks!" 

_(continued conversation)_ "I received the credits after all. After rebooting my PC the lost credits were added extra. Thanks once again for the quick response"
