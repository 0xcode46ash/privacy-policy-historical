**Cookies**

Eurostar places a cookie on your computer when you first enter the website to identify your country and (if applicable) language preferences.  A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you, which enables us to display content relevant to your market.  For the use of the Eurostar Booking Engine, the cookie is also used to keep track of Eurostar products placed in the Shopping Basket.  If you create a "My Eurostar" and select the "auto-login" option, a unique ID number will be placed in your cookie to enable you to return to the Eurostar website without having to login again.  Only non-personal information is stored in your cookie. If you disable the cookies, you will still be able to use the website and book tickets.

We use "cookies" to identify you when you visit the Eurostar site and to build up a demographic profile.  Our use of cookies also allows registered users to be presented with a personalised version of the site.

**Tagging of the Site**

Eurostar uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables Eurostar to learn which advertisements bring users to Eurostar’s website.  The cookie was placed by Eurostar or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that Eurostar collects and shares is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to: <http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy>

**Security of passenger information**

Eurostar stores passenger information in a central database, which is managed by our administrative staff and authorised agencies and is accessible electronically.  Security measures are in place to ensure that data can not be accessed by unauthorised persons.  From time to time people such as I.T. systems suppliers may need to access the system.  Eurostar’s security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.

**Your Personal Data**

You have the right to see the personal data held on you by Eurostar.  Eurostar will provide this information for the maximum fee permitted by statute 

Please put your request in writing to:

Eurostar Group Ltd, Customer Services, Times House, Bravingtons Walk, London N1 9AW or by e-mail to [newsletter@eurostar.com](mailto:newsletter@eurostar.com).

**To query protection of your personal data**
