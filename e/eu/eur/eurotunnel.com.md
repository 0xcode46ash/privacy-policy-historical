##### Cookie policy - Information Eurotunnel Le Shuttle collects from you

 **a) What is a cookie?  
** A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (device) browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to monitor online traffic flows.

On Eurotunnel Le Shuttle's website, cookies record information about your online preferences and behavior. Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised features cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly they may not be able to take full advantage of all of the website's features. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

During the course of any visit to eurotunnel.com, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on the next visit by checking, and finding, the cookie that was left there on the last visit.

 **b) How does Eurotunnel Le Shuttle use cookies?  
** Information supplied by cookies can help Eurotunnel Le Shuttle to understand the preferences and behaviour of visitors and help to provide you with a better user experience.

 **c) Third Party Cookies on Eurotunnel.com  
** Please note that during your visits to Eurotunnel.com you may notice some cookies that are not related to Eurotunnel Le Shuttle. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube, you may be presented with cookies from these websites. Eurotunnel Le Shuttle does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the third party websites for more information about these.

Eurotunnel Le Shuttle uses third party marketing services such as Doubleclick and Criteo. These services are used to present you with digital advertising on third party websites. They use a cookie to follow your activity from the third party website onto the eurotunel.com website?

d **) Eurotunnel Le Shuttle cookies and how to reject cookies?  
** A list of the main cookies that Eurotunnel.com set (and what each is used for) together with ways to minimise the number of cookies you receive can be found at the [Eurotunnel Le Shuttle Cookie List](https://web.archive.org/uk/Cookie-List/ "Eurotunnel Le Shuttle Cookie List")..

##### Pixels (Web beacon) – Email tracking

We use Pixels (Web beacon) within our emails to monitor delivery to intended customers. This is to provide information to Eurotunnel Le Shuttle such as the number of emails received against the number sent, emails opened, the duration between being sent and opened, etc. The information received is then used to improve and optimise our next set of emails in order to improve the information and emails sent to customers. Click here for further information on Pixels (Web beacons).

  *  **How to Opt-out of pixel tracking  
** Within your individual e-mail client (outlook, Gmail, etc.), turn off image display, disable the display of links, and decline any read-receipt requests. This will prevent the tracking pixel from being displayed and subsequently sending information back to Eurotunnel Le Shuttle.
