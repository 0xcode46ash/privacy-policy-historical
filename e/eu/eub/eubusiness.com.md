**Information Collection and Use**  
We collect information from our users at several different points on the website - this is for customer service and billing purposes, we also collect data from our users so that we can customise the site according to individual selections. EUbusiness is the sole owner of the personal information collected from this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others.

**Registration**  
In order to receive our email alerts, users have to complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers, but encouraged so we can provide a more personalised experience.

**Order Forms**  
We request information from users on our order forms. Users have to provide contact information (such as name and delivery address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiry date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

**Cookies**  
We use cookies to make this website as useful as possible. Cookies are small text files we put in your browser to track usage of our site, but they don't tell us who you are. 

Once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. We use cookies so that we can personalise your experience of the website. If you set up your browser to reject the cookie, you will still be able to use the Website. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). Please note we have no access to or control over these cookies.

Most big websites or internet service providers use cookies, for example to help the site remember your settings such as language, font size and other preferences for how you want to view the site on your computer. The benefit is that you don't have to keep re-entering these details every time you come back to us.

A cookie is a small text file written to your hard drive that contains information about you. Once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. We use cookies so that we can personalise your experience of the Website. If you set up your browser to reject the cookie, you may still use the Website.

**Can I reject cookies?**  
If you are worried about cookies, and you want to restrict or block the cookies which are set by the EUbusiness.com website, you can do this through your browser settings. The Help function within your browser should tell you how. 

However, please be aware that restricting cookies will have an impact on the functionality of the website and the quality of your user experience.

**Advertising**  
EUbusiness runs advertising for a wide variety of organisations. We use third-party ad servers to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (NOT including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this website in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Third-party ad servers include Google. These ad servers may attempt to set cookies (see above) on your computer.

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

**Links**  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that EUbusiness is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of these third party sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**Newswires**  
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newswires, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.

**Surveys& Contests**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information requested. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and delivery address), and demographic information (such as postcode, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the functionality of the site.

**Security**  
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, as will be the case for most of the time that a user is browsing the web.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [service@eubusiness.com](mailto:service@eubusiness.com)

**Correcting/Updating Personal Information**  
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your postcode), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavour to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done by sending an email to [service@eubusiness.com](mailto:service@eubusiness.com)

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
