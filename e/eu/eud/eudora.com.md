> Our website uses cookies, which are used to measure various metrics pertaining to user traffic and frequency of visit to our website. There is no personal identifiable information associated with these metrics. The metrics are aggregated and made available publicly to indicate website traffic patterns. 

**EUDORA Desktop Email Client.**

> Eudora 4.3 or greater running in Sponsored mode, Light mode or Paid mode, whether purchased in a retail store or downloaded electronically, regularly contacts QUALCOMM update servers to check if newer versions of Eudora are available. If a newer version is available, Eudora will notify the user and give the user the option to upgrade. The user has the ability to disable the update check at any time. Instructions for disabling this feature can be found at eudora.com for [Windows](http://www.eudora.com/techsupport/kb/2111hq.html) and [Mac](http://www.eudora.com/techsupport/kb/2122hq.html) versions of the software. The program also checks to see whether the logo of a co-branding affiliate should appear in the Light and Sponsored modes. No personal information whatsoever is transmitted back to QUALCOMM during these processes. 
> 
> **Registration Information**  
>  When a user registers, we collect certain contact information (like email address and first and last name) that will be used to verify the user's eligibility for services and upgrades, provide services like technical support and verify a user's identity in the case of a lost registration code. This information may also be used to contact the user, with their permission. 
> 
> **Other Information**  
>  We also may ask, a small percentage of users who have authorized us to do so, to send us information on their Eudora usage (like features used) and Internet connection time. **This does not contain actual data entered by the user. Any identifying information gathered is immediately separated from this information, so that we have no idea whose usage pattern we have.**
> 
> **User Profile**  
>  When users fill out a demographic profile, a profile ID is generated and sent to the Eudora client software on the user's system. This information is used to serve ads that are more relevant to the user. The user can choose to modify or delete the profile at any time. 
> 
> We aggregate this information eliminating personally identifiable information in the process. The aggregate information is shared with advertisers 
> 
> **We will never, for any purpose whatsoever, examine the contents, addresses, subjects or attachments of user emails. This is true of all other data users enter in their address book, personalities, filters, stationery, etc.**

**Statement on Unsolicited Bulk or Commercial Email ("SPAM")**  
QUALCOMM is committed to preventing the transmission, distribution or delivery of unsolicited bulk or commercial email ("SPAM") and it is the policy of QUALCOMM, its affiliates and advertisers at all times to comply with the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 and other applicable laws, rules, and regulations in connection with the transmission, distribution or delivery of SPAM. 

**Updates to this Privacy Statement**  
While we will never change our fundamental commitment to protecting user privacy, regulatory changes or other circumstances may require us to modify this Privacy Statement. In the event that we do amend this Statement, we will post the amended Statement on our website at http://www.eudora.com/privacy, and the amended Statement will be effective immediately.
