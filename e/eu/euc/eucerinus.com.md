2\. What personal information is collected?

We collect information from you when you register on this website, join Club Blue, respond to a survey or to a communication such as an email, or use other services on this website.  We store that information ourselves or by the use of third parties under contract with us.  Those other services may include, for example, the creation of a profile page, participation in forums or the provision of facilities to permit you to post media content such as images and text.

Some of the information that we collect from you is defined as personally identifiable information about an individual, as more particularly described under applicable privacy laws (“Personal Information”).  Personal Information may include, without limitation: your name, age, mailing address, email address, telephone number, credit card information and related financial information, information concerning your interests, occupation, product uses and preferences, and other demographic information that could help identify you.  If you have set up an account that is password protected in order to play online games, to purchase goods or for any other purpose for which a password is needed, that password is also part of your Personal Information.  It may be possible to use portions of this website without providing any Personal Information, but it may be necessary to provide Personal Information to utilize all features of this website.

For some activities, your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding your computer to Beiersdorf.  Beiersdorf may use that information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community and may provide that information to advertisers and other parties with whom we have a business relationship.  In addition, Beiersdorf may use any such information for security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, cheating and other improper or unlawful activities), or enforcement purposes.

Beiersdorf may also identify and track your Internet protocol (“IP”) address.  An IP address is the unique number assigned to your server or internet service provider (“ISP”).   Beiersdorf may track those IP addresses for system administration purposes, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our data and servers from being damaged.

6\. What are cookies and how do we use them?

A cookie is a small bit of computer code that we send to your computer and is stored on your hard drive.  It allows a website to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes.  A cookie stored in your computer can be used to “remember” specific data items such as your password or operational information, such as the fact that you have already subscribed to the full version of a particular online game.  That allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or subscription information.  In addition, Beiersdorf may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes.

7\. Does Beiersdorf disclose personal Information it collects to outside parties?

We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information as required or permitted by law.  For example, we may disclose it to respond to a subpoena, court order or other legal process, or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing Personal Information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you if we reasonably believe that you may be violating your agreements with us (including, without limitation, any applicable terms of use), or may be causing injury to, or interference with, Beiersdorf, any other user of this website or any service, the general public or other third parties. You may be asked whether you wish to receive information from third parties; upon your consent, Beiersdorf or those third parties may use your Personal Information to contact you. However, please be aware that Beiersdorf cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we provide data; we therefore cannot guarantee that they will adhere to similar privacy and security procedures as Beiersdorf.
