The Site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as name and email address) and demographic information (such as postal code, age, or income level) and other information that is used by us to provide services. Users may, however, visit the site anonymously.

This Site uses an ad form for customers to place online and/or print ads.

We have no control over who views online or print ads.

We collect customers financial information (such as account or credit card numbers) to bill the user for products and services, but retain this information only as required to process the transaction and for as long as may be required by law.

Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (such as email addresses) and demographic information (such as postal code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send users information about our products and services. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the Opt-Out section below).
