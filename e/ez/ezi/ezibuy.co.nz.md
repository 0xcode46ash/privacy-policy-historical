# Privacy Policy

EziBuy is trying to bringing you the best, most interesting information possible, tailored where we can to your individual needs. We are also committed to protecting your privacy. 

We will not collect any information about individuals, except where it is specifically and knowingly provided by them. Examples of such information are: 

Name   
Address   
Telephone number   
Email address

The information collected will be used to send you the information you have requested and to help us develop the site to be useful to you. We may share non-personal aggregate statistics (group) data about our readers, sales and traffic patterns with partners or other parties. However, we do not sell or share any information about individual users. 

The Service may also place cookies on your computer. These are only accessible by us and will only be used to track the pages of the web site visited by you, in order for us to build a better site more tailored to your needs and interests. Our cookies do not record personal information about you, merely your computer. 

If you choose to subscribe to the EziBuy regular newsletter, we will from time to time email you with special offers or deals . This service is completely discretionary. If you decide you no longer wish to receive the newsletter, just follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the email. 

Whilst we make every effort to provide you with links to high quality, reputable sites, they are not under our day-to-day control. When you click through to these sites you leave the area controlled by EziBuy. We cannot therefore accept responsibility for any issues arising in connection with either their use of your data, the site content or the services offered to our readers by these sites. 

In addition to EziBuy's safeguards your personal data is protected in New Zealand by the Privacy Act. This provides, amongst other things, that the data we hold about you should be processed lawfully and fairly. It should be accurate, relevant and not excessive. The information should be kept up to date, where necessary, and not retained for longer than is necessary. You have the right to see what is held about you and correct any inaccuracies. EziBuy treats all the data held with the utmost care and security. Any details you give will remain completely confidential.
