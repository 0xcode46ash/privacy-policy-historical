We have put in place the following policy to protect your personal information. By using our website and/or providing information to us, you consent to the policy. 

What personal information do we collect?

You may give us information about yourself, such as your name, address, email address and telephone numbers, when, for example, you become an EziBuy member, request a catalogue or make a purchase from us. If you do not give this information, we may not be able to provide goods or services to you.

When you visit our website we may collect more information, such as the address of your Internet service provider, the name of the web page directing you, and your clicks and activity on our site. 

ClickTale

This site uses ClickTale web analytics service. ClickTale may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as any text you type in this website. ClickTale does not collect personally identifiable information that you do not voluntarily enter in this website. ClickTale does not track your browsing habits across web sites which do not use ClickTale services.

We are using the information collected by ClickTale service to improve the user experience on our website. You can choose to disable the Service at <http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html>.

How do we use the personal information?

We may use the information to process your transactions, to administer your account, to conduct credit and other checks, for our own internal purposes (such as risk management, staff training and billing), to help us to develop our website to be more available and user friendly to our customers, and for any other use which you may authorise.

In addition, we may use the information to promote and market our products and services, or the products and services of others. However, we will not do this by email or text (except as part of an email which facilitates, completes or confirms a transaction with you) unless we have your express, inferred or deemed consent to do so. These emails and texts will always include an "unsubscribe" facility. Further, if you do not wish to receive them, you can update your records on our website, call us on 0508 500 500 or email us at [mail@ezibuy.co.nz](mailto:mail@ezibuy.co.nz).

Will we disclose the information to others?

We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others.

However, we do use other companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf, such as delivering packages, sending mail and emails and processing payments. They will have access to your personal information needed to perform these services, but we will not authorise them to use your information for other purposes.

We also disclose your information to our business partners, such as financial services or insurance companies, for them to offer products and services to you. This information may include scrambled credit card details, although these will only be used with your consent for any transactions with them. If you do not wish your information to be disclosed, call us on 0508 500 500 or email us at [mail@ezibuy.co.nz](mailto:mail@ezibuy.co.nz).

In addition, we may provide statistics with personal identifiers removed about our customers, readers, sales, traffic patterns and related site functions to reputable third parties.
