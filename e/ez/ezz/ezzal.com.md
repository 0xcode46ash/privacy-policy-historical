This includes internet protocol ( IP ) addresses, browser type, internet service provider ( ISP ), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

www.ezzal.com does use cookies to store information about visitors preferences, record user-specific information on which pages the user access or visit, customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends. 

Some of our advertising partners may use cookies and web beacons on our site. Our advertising partners include Google Adsense, . 

These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on www.ezzal.com.

They may also use other technologies ( such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons ) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.

**GUESTS**  
We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. .However, our web server logs some visitor information and we use this for statistical purposes. 

**MEMBERS**  
Your profile information will be available to anyone who chooses to view it. Do not put sensitive personal information in your profile. We will not share your e-mail address or any sensitive information about you with anyone. It will be used to send you site news and newsletters. You may opt-out of these at any time once you've logged into the site. 

**THE GAMES**

To minimise the risk of infringement on any copyright of the games, we have taken a number of measures. Through this page we want to inform our users, or everyone having an interest in this.

  1. We requested and obtained permission for a number of the games from the copyright holders known to us.
  2. Many of the games may be included on any Internet site without any (prerequisite) constraints. For some we could not find any copyright information or due to general use on the Internet, this information can no longer be obtained.
  3. Some games may be used under special conditions, considering a number of prerequisite constraints. These prerequisite constraints are, as far as we could determine, met by ezzal.com.
  4. We do not change anything in the source code of the games. For example, credit holders, brand names, or references to websites remain unchanged.
  5. For a number of games, the so-called deep linking technique is used. Here, we set up a link to the Internet address where the original games code is situated and the games code (FLASH or SHOCKWAVE) is NOT copied to the ezzal.com server. We are aware of the fact that deep linking is a subject of discussion, however, there is no information known to us to indicate that this is illegal (see [_articles_](http://directory.google.com/Top/Society/Law/Legal_Information/Computer_and_Technology_Law/Internet/Linking_Law/) on (deep)linking). We are also backed in this belief by the fact that this technique is applied by many other Internet sites.



The legislation around Internet developments and applications is still in full swing, and whatever is/is not allowed is not always obvious and there is room for subjective interpretations. It is therefore possible that, despite our careful and genuine intentions, a copyright holder may still feel that his/her interests are damaged. In such case, we request that you contact us. This can be done via an e-mail to the editors.

If your objection is reasonable i.e. comprehensible, the relevant game will immediately be removed from ezzal.com. Our experience has indicated that this approach works very well.

Thank you.
