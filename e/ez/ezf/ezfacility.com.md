## 4\. Web Site Navigational Information

EZFacility uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Company’s Web sites ("Web Site Navigational Information") . This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information the Company may collect and how the Company may use this information.

#### Cookies 

EZFacility uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company’s Web sites, EZFacility’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to EZFacility, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a "Contact Me" or a "Free Trial" Web form), you remain anonymous to the Company.

There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.

If you have chosen to identify yourself to EZFacility, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Service, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Service and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Service.

EZFacility uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Company’s Web sites. When you purchase the Service or provide the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places on your Web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s Web sites, but you will not be able to successfully use the Service.

EZFacility may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with Data about EZFacility Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Service.

#### Web Beacons

EZFacility uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web sites and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For example, EZFacility may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company’s Web sites. EZFacility uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s Web sites and email communications. EZFacility may use information from Web beacons in combination with Data about EZFacility Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Service.

EZFacility Customers use the Service to host data and information ("Customer Data"). EZFacility will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in the EZFacility Master Subscription Agreement, or as may be required by law. Individual records of Customer Data may be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issues, or suspected violation of the EZFacility Master Subscription Agreement, or as may be required by law. Customers are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of their EZFacility usernames and passwords.

## 10\. Security

EZFacility uses robust security measures to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of Customer Data. When the Service is accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, Firefox version 2.0 or later, or Safari version 3.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology protects Customer Data using both server authentication and data encryption. These technologies help ensure that Customer Data is safe, secure, and only available to the Customer to whom the information belongs and those to whom the Customer has granted access. EZFacility also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and the Company hosts its Web sites in a secure server environment that uses firewalls and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. EZFacility also offers enhanced security features within the Service that permit Customers to configure security settings to the level they deem necessary.

Because the Company uses the Service to maintain Data about EZFacility Customers, this information is secured in the same manner as described above for Customer Data.
