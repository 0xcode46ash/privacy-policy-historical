# eZdia :: Privacy Notice

We at eZdia respect your privacy and take the issue of Internet privacy very seriously. By accepting the eZdia Terms of Service, you consent to the use and disclosure of personal information that you provide to us as outlined in this Privacy Statement. As eZdia improves its services, we may modify the Privacy Statement, and urge you to check here for updates from time to time. 

**Registration Information**

In order to use this website, both eZdia Clients and eZdia Experts must first complete the registration form. During registration we request users' contact information, such as name and email address. This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest, and is also used as the user's sign in information. It is optional for the user to provide additional personalized information (such as experience and qualifications) and unique identifiers (such as a screen name), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. During the Registration process, you have the ability to "opt-out" of receiving eZdia newsletters and promotions. 

**Services Through the Site**

You provide us with information during the process of using the eZdia service. We break down users of our service into two categories, Clients and Experts (you may register as both a Client and an Expert). Clients must provide financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date in order to pay for and use the eZdia service. Experts must provide contact information, like name and mailing address, in order to receive their payment from eZdia. The information we collect from both Clients and Experts is to provide users with the best possible eZdia service. If we have trouble providing that service, we may use contact information to get in touch with the user. 

**Client-Expert Communication Using the eZdia Service**

The main purpose of eZdia is to allow registered eZdia Experts to provide Clients with services that the Clients need. Experts and Members can negotiate and enter into a contract for a service using the eZdia site. Certain communications may be recorded and maintained by eZdia. eZdia does not screen or edit the content of communications between Clients and Experts. Such communications are personal and private unless both parties agree to additional distribution, for example by posting questions or services on the Public Board (described later). Information that is relayed between the Client and the Expert during either the negotiation phase of their relationship or during the actual relaying of service is kept completely confidential, and no other users of eZdia have access to this information. 

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are also linked to personally identifiable information in order to better the user's experience when using our site. We may also retain any emails, letters, or other correspondence between you and eZdia to ensure quality control and the best possible service, although we have no obligation to do so. 

**Use of Information Available Through eZdia**

To ensure both Clients and Experts with the best service possible on our site, and to facilitate communication among Clients and Experts, eZdia provides email addresses to Clients and Experts only under specific circumstances, including but not necessarily limited to participants involved in disputed and unpaid transactions. By reviewing eZdia's Terms of Service and approving eZdia's Legal Agreement, registered users of eZdia agree to use the Public Board area and all communication facilities provided by eZdia exclusively for interaction associated with eZdia services and their delivery. Registered users may not use information gathered through a eZdia transaction to defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the legal and civil rights of any other registered user. Registered users may not use information gathered through a eZdia transaction to sell any goods or services for any commercial purpose outside the scope of the eZdia service. Email addresses and personal information may not be used to forward surveys contests, pyramid schemes or chain letters, or to post the same message repeatedly (a practice referred to as "spamming"). eZdia may terminate the ability of any Client or Expert to use the eZdia service. 

**Security We Provide**

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted. We use the industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption and firewalls to protect against loss, misuse, and alteration of any personal data under our control. 

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with eZdia, Please write email us at: support@eZdia.com. You may also contact us by mail at 7322 SouthWest Fwy, Suite 1100, Houston TX 77074.
