# Eeggs.com - Privacy Policy

**Eeggs.com Privacy Policy**

Eeggs.com and its advertisers and affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information. 

Third Party Advertising

This site, The Easter Egg Archive, uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, Engage collects anonymous data through the use of cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out of the Engage system, go to <http://www.engage.com/privacy>. 

Consumer Information 

Eeggs.com itself does not track any information about you at all as you browse through our site. We do not use cookies or any other means to track your browsing habits. 

The only information we collect is completely voluntary. When you "register" with us, we collect a small amount of information such as your name and email address. This is not used for any purpose other than allowing the webmaster and/or other visitors contact you regarding the Eggs and comments you publicly post. You will not receive any unsolicited bulk email, and your information will not be given or sold to third parties. 

Data Collection and Opt Out Procedure 

Since the only data we collect is completely voluntary, the average visitor doesn't have to do anything to "opt out" of our data collection procedure. If, however, you are a registered user and you wish to be removed from our registration database, simply email the webmaster at [webmaster@eeggs.com](mailto:webmaster@eeggs.com). We can easily take you off the list. 

If you have any additional questions about Eeggs.com's privacy policies, please contact us at [webmaster@eeggs.com](mailto:webmaster@eeggs.com).
