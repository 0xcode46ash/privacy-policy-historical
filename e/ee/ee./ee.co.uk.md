Our Cookies Policy
We use cookies to collect information from visitors and registered customers to our websites to help
us improve the websites and services that we make available. Most web browsers automatically
accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to refuse cookies if you prefer. If
you want to disable cookies, find out which browser you are using and follow the instructions below in
our ‘how to refuse or opt out of cookies’ section Unfortunately, if you choose to decline cookies, some
of the interactive features and some functionality of our websites may not be available to you. We
advise regular users of our websites to accept cookies from us.
Different cookies are used to perform different functions. We detail below our use of cookies. Please
note that our advertisers or third party websites to which we link may also use cookies over which we
have no control.
Our use of cookies
Essential Cookies
Some cookies are essential for us to use in order to provide you with the services you have
requested. These cookies will be used to manage the delivery of any web services requested by you
and if you do not accept these cookies you will not be able to receive the services that you have
requested e.g. pay for goods and services or access secure areas of our websites. These cookies do
not gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes or remembering where
you have been on the internet.
Remembering your selections cookies
We also use cookies to remember your selections that change the way our websites behave or look
e.g. the font sizes or layout you have chosen etc. These types of cookies can also be used to deliver
a specific function requested by you which is not core to the usage of the website e.g. streaming a
video. Please note that if you delete these cookies, we will no longer be able to remember your
preferences or remember your log in details or provide you with the content you have requested.
When selecting your choices for the first time we may ask you whether you want us to remember your
choices and if you do this it will constitute consent of our use of cookies for these purposes. These
cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes or
remembering where you have been on the internet. If you no longer wish for us to remember your
selections, please delete cookies on your machine. To find out about how to opt out of cookies,
please see our ‘how to refuse or opt out of cookies’ section below.
Customisation Cookies
We also use cookies to change the way our website behave or look in order to personalise your
experience from information we infer from your behaviour on our websites or information we already
know about you e.g. because you are a registered customer. These cookies may be used to tailor the
content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you
personalise webpages, or register for products or services, a cookie helps our webpage server to
recall your specific information. When you next visit our website, the information you previously
provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose.
Even if you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we can link cookies together
so you will still receive a personalised online experience. We can also personalise the information
you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things.
So, instead of one website for all website visitors, each visitor can have a website experience
which is unique to them.


It is entirely up to you if you wish to have a customised experience on our websites. To find out about
how to opt out of cookies, please see our ‘how to refuse or opt out of cookies’ section below.
Analytics Cookies
We also use our own unique cookies and/or third party cookies for analytics purposes to analyse the
use of our websites and enhance the performance of our websites. These cookies may be used for
testing different designs and ensuring a consistent look and feel is maintained for users of our
websites, track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites, track errors
and track ads for advertising revenue purposes. The data collected will generally be aggregated to
provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance
metrics. This analysis may be performed by third parties but will be for the review and benefit of
Everything Everywhere only. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit
our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our
websites and services. This information allows us to continuously improve our services and
develop them according to the taste of our customers and visitors. Your use of our websites
indicates your consent to the use of these web analytics cookies. To find out about how to opt out of
cookies, please see our ‘how to refuse or opt out of cookies’ section. Please note that you may
experience functional problems if you delete these cookies.
Advertising cookies
We use various technologies including cookies and web beacons (also known as 'pixel tags') to
serve ads when you visit our websites. These gather information about your visits to our websites and
other websites within ad networks with whom we partner, which help us serve our ads and third party
ads to you. In the course of serving these ads, our own unique cookies and/or third party cookies may
be placed or recognised on your browser. In addition, we use web beacons, provided by our ad
serving partners to help manage our online advertising. These web beacons enable our ad server to
recognise a browser’s cookie when a browser visits our website and to learn which banner ads bring
users to our websites. If you are a registered user, the information collected from our websites is
not anonymous and we may use this information along with other information we hold on you
including your preferences to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you. The
information we collect and share with third parties through cookies is anonymous: it does not include
your name, address, or any other information which is likely to identify you.
It is entirely up to you if you wish to receive tailored advertising. To find out about how to opt out of
cookies, please see our ‘how to refuse or opt out of cookies’ section. Please also read about third
party cookies.
When we use cookies
During the registration process
We allocate cookies during the registration process for our services. These cookies will hold
information collected during your registration and will allow us to recognise you as a customer
and provide you with the services you require. If your browser is set to reject cookies, you will
not be able to register for services. We may also use this data to better understand your
interests while online and to personalise your visits to our websites.
On different sections of our portal
Our servers use two different types of cookies.
The first type is known as a 'session-based' cookie and is allocated to your computer only for the
duration of your visit to our Web site. It helps you to move around the Web site faster and, if
you're a registered customer, it allows us to give you information relevant to your selected
service. This cookie automatically expires when you close down your browser.
The second type of cookie is known as a 'persistent' cookie. These cookies will remain on your
computer for a period of time set for each cookie. These cookies allow us to:


     •   limit how often you see a particular advertisement or announcement on our web site;
     •   identify your preferences when customising content for you;
     •   provide you with relevant self-help information;
     •   record how many times you visit a page or advertisement;
     •   limit and record how often you can vote in our polls;
     •   confirm you are a registered user and save your login details when accessing certain
         services on our websites; and
     •   collect statistics on the use of our services.
We may also use cookies and web beacons to ensure that our mailing tools are working
properly. Other companies which advertise or offer their products or services on our websites
will also allocate cookies to your computer, over which we have no control. The types of
cookies they use and how they use the information generated by them will be governed by those
companies’ privacy policies. We provide below a list of third parties with whom we have a
business relationship. This list is not fully exhaustive and is updated by us from time to time.
Another form of website measurement and customisation technology is performed by the use of flash
cookies which are created by Adobe Flash. To manage these cookies, visit the Website Storage
Settings Panel on www.adobe.com. Everything Everywhere is minimising its use of flash cookies but
they may be used by third parties on our websites.
