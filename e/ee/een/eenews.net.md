# E&E Publishing -- Privacy Policy

E&E Publishing wants you to use [www.eenews.net](http://www.eenews.net/) and our related Web sites with the knowledge that we have taken steps to implement fair information practices designed to protect your privacy. The following explains what information we collect about you and how we use it. 

## What information do we collect?

Our Web site site automatically recognizes your domain name, IP address, browser version, operating system, the user name of subscribers when they log-on and the site you passed through to reach [www.eenews.net](http://www.eenews.net/). Our site automatically gathers certain usage statistics, including the volume and frequency of visitors to specific pages on our site. Specific information about you is only collected by our Web site when you voluntarily provide that information -- such as your name, organization, address, telephone number and e-mail address -- when you subscribe to one of our services or sign-up for a trial. We also collect and temporarily store a copy of our articles that readers email to a third-party using our Web site's "email this story" function.

## Why do we collect certain information?

The information we automatically collect is used to determine what stories, publications and reports generate the most interest among our readers. It also helps us monitor general trends in how the site is used.

## What do we tell others about you? 

We do not provide informationÂ about individual usage automatically collected by our Web site -- or provided to us voluntarily -- to third parties unless we are legally required to do this. We do on occasion provide statistical data to partners and clients in order to explain how subscribers use our Web site. This data is aggregated and does not provide specific information about individuals or their usage of our Web site. Some organizations, as part of a subscription agreement, do require us to provide information about how frequently their employees, in aggregate, use our site.

## What are your options?

We use e-mail to notify people that our publications are published and also to provide other notifications about our products. You have the option of not receiving e-mail from us. To stop receiving e-mail or to get e-mail only for specific publications, go to <http://www.eenews.net/subscriptioninfo/noemail.html> and use the brief form to tell us what you would like us to do.
