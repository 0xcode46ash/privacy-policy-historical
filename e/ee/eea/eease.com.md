Employease Privacy Policy

Employease, Inc. ("Employease," "our," "us" and "we") has created this privacy policy in order to communicate our commitment to the privacy of information provided to us by our employer customers and their employees. We understand the nature of the information entrusted to us and acknowledge that maintenance of the privacy of such information is of the highest importance to our customers and their employees. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for our web site, http://www.employease.com ("Web Site"), and our services, as described in our Master Service Agreement ("MSA") ("Service" or "Services").  


Our Information Practices

We collect, use and disclose the following categories of information in the following ways, subject to the Exceptions section, which follows below.

**Company Contact Information**  
When customers and prospective customers contract for Services or inquire about our Services, we ask them to provide us with company contact information, some examples of which are the company's name, address, number of employees and industry classification. We use company contact information to provide information to customers and prospective customers regarding our Services and to maintain a record of inquiries regarding our Services. We will also send customers and prospective customers email messages using company contact information in the following circumstances: 

welcome customers to our Service;  
explain the new features of our Service as our Service develops and grows;  
notify customers and prospective customers of Service promotions; and  
communicate with customers about their use of our Service. 

We do **not** share company or contact information with any other entities.

**Employee Information**  
When our employer customers utilize our Services to manage and communicate employee information on behalf of their employees, they provide us with information typically provided by an employee to an employer's human resources and/or payroll departments. Such information often includes, but is not limited to, the employee's name, address, social security number, title, salary, date of hire, benefit elections and information regarding an employee's dependents. We utilize the information provided to deliver Services to our employer customers and their employees. 

Unless directed by our customers, we do not share employee information provided by our customers with anyone. When directed by our customers, we communicate company employee information to third party service providers such as payroll service bureaus, insurance companies and third party administrators, among others. We may also aggregate employee information from multiple employer customers to perform analyses. 

Examples of analyses performed include, but are not limited to: number of employees enrolled in plans provided by a particular insurance carrier, average number of employees employed by our customers and average number of benefit plans sponsored by our customers. When used to perform such analyses, information provided by an employer customer or its employees is never disclosed in a level of detail sufficient to permit the identification of any individual employer customer or individual employee record. 

**Login Identification and Passwords**  
Our Service requires users to provide us with login identification and a password, which we will use to verify your identity and for our internal use in maintaining your customer account.
