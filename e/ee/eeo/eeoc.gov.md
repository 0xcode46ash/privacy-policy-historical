We collect no personal information about you when you visit www.eeoc.gov unless you choose to provide this information to us. Our web server, which is run by the Government Printing Office (GPO), does collect certain information automatically, and some of this information is made available to us.

## If you visit our site to read or download information, the following information is collected automatically by the web server:

  * The name of the domain (for example, aol.com, if you use an America OnLine Account, or princeton.edu if you connect from Princeton University's domain), and the IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web) from which you access the Internet;
  * The date and time that you access our site; and
  * The pages you visit.



GPO uses special software to analyze the information collected in the web server's logs, and generates a report for us that we use to determine the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors like you. We do not track or record information about individuals and their visits.

## If you send us personal information

If you choose to provide us with personal information, as in e-mail with a comment or question, or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it to us through our web site, we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you have requested. We do not share our e-mail with any other organizations, unless we receive a request from an organization conducting a civil or criminal law enforcement investigation.

## Links to other sites

Our web site has links to other federal agencies. In a few cases we may link to private organizations. When you link to another site, you are no longer on our site and are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.

## Use of cookies

The main purpose of this is to improve accessibility and make the site easier to use for people with limited vision, or people who use adaptive equipment to access the web. It may also be of use for people using hand-held computers, WebTV, or other alternative web access devices. If you choose to use this feature, a "cookie" will be set on your web browser. The only thing we put in the cookie is the name of the style sheet you select. We do not track or monitor cookies, and no personal information will be collected or stored. We do not use cookies for any other purpose.
