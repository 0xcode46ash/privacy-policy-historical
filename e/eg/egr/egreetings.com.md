Your privacy matters to us: 

At Egreetings Network, we believe strongly in protecting our users' privacy. We may collect personal information from you when you join Egreetings, when you enter a site promotion or when you send one of our online cards. You also may choose to provide personal information at other times, such as when you enter a contest or ask that information be sent to you from one of our partners or advertisers. When you become a member of Egreetings, you provide personal information as described in the "registration information" section below. As an Egreetings member, you are always entitled to update your personal information if necessary by contacting customer service. To access your membership information, simply go to "Members" and choose "Change my info." You can also choose which mailings you would like to receive by clicking "My preferences." 

If you choose to send an Egreetings card, but not to become a member of Egreetings, you must provide your email address and the email address of the recipient. This information is used to customize the greeting and notify both you and the recipient that the greeting has been sent. Because we are committed to protecting your privacy, Egreetings will not sell, rent or otherwise disclose this information to any third party, except as described in this policy. We maintain your personal information as private to the best of our ability. However, personal information may be disclosed under the limited circumstances described below, and by using our service, you agree that we may do so. 

Registration information - collection and use: 

If you choose to register with Egreetings or otherwise provide us with your personal information, you may provide us with certain current, complete and accurate personal identifying information, such as your name, email address, gender, ZIP code and year of birth. Because we are committed to protecting your privacy, Egreetings will not sell or rent such personal information to any third party. 

When you register as a member of Egreetings or use our service, you have the opportunity to choose whether to receive email messages from us. The types of messages you may choose to receive include updates, previews and highlights of content and service offerings, mailings from us featuring our sponsors' products or services, and other features and information that may enhance your experience as an Egreetings member or user. We believe that it is beneficial to both you and our sponsors to provide you with information relevant to your interaction with our site. For example, if you use our music channel and have elected to receive email messages from us, we may infer that you would find valuable a special offer relating to music events such as concerts, discounts on recorded music, or contests. Of course, you may tell us at any time that you do not wish to receive these messages by going to "Members," clicking on "My preferences" and changing your mail preferences, or by clearly following the "unsubscribe" instructions at the bottom of any email you receive from us, or finally by contacting our customer service department to unsubscribe to any mailing list. 

Communication: 

Each time you use our service, Egreetings will send you an email verifying the order and confirming that the email requested was sent on your behalf. We also reserve the right to send all users of our service email communications from time to time regarding updates, various links to our site, changes to the service, technical or administrative issues, legal notices, or other important information about our site and our products and services that we consider essential to the provision of the Egreetings service. Users and members are not able to unsubscribe from these announcements that contain important information about the Egreetings service. 

What information is shared? 

Egreetings is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. Egreetings does share non-personal, non-individual information in aggregate form with third parties for business purposes, such as with advertisers on our site. For example, we may tell our business partners how many customers in certain demographic groups sent certain cards. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person in any way. 

Egreetings will not disclose your personal information to any third parties without your consent except in the following very limited circumstances: 

Legal requirements and investigations: 

We will disclose your personal information to any a third party if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property or prevent fraud; (3) protect against abuse, misuse or unauthorized use of Egreetings' service; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our members or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false or deceptive registration information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you -- including your computer's IP address -- may be disclosed to a third party (including the recipient of an email) as part of any type of investigation into your actions.) 

Agents: 

From time to time, we employ other companies and individuals to provide functions and perform services on our behalf. Examples of these functions may include, but are not limited to, fulfilling orders, credit card payments and email delivery management. These agents have access to personal information only as needed to perform their functions and not for any other purposes and are bound by confidentiality agreements not to disclose any information for any other purpose. 

Sale of assets 

Egreetings may transfer its customer database, including personal information contained therein, to a third party who acquires all or substantially all of the assets or stock of Egreetings whether by merger, acquisition, reorganization or otherwise. 

Kids under 13 

It is Egreetings' policy and practice not to solicit personally identifiable information from children. As of April 2000, Egreetings will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our registration process is also designed to ensure that no one under the age of 13 may join Egreetings.com as a member. The year of birth is a required field in the registration form. Any persons submitting birth dates identifying themselves as minors under 13 will not be permitted to register. If we receive notice that a member has provided incorrect information during registration and is actually under 13 years of age, we will immediately close their member account and cease collecting information. Note To Parents: If you have any concerns about the Egreetings.com website and its services or how we handle personally identifiable information for kids under 13, please contact us at [Parents Info.](mailto:parentsinfo@egreetings.com). 

Address book: 

As an Egreetings member, you may have been provided with an online address book to keep track of important email addresses of friends and family. Address book information is considered highly confidential and will not be used for promotional purposes by Egreetings nor will it be disclosed to any third parties. 

Reminder service: 

As an Egreetings member, we may have provided you with the opportunity to set reminders for important holidays and occasions. The reminders we send at your request may include links to our site for relevant content, products or services or may contain offers from our sponsors that may be relevant to you. We consider your personal reminder notification information highly confidential and it will not be disclosed to third parties. 

Greeting card information: 

When you send one of our online cards, the information you provide to us is used to customize your card with the recipient's name and with your message, and to deliver an email notification to the recipient. We treat our online cards as private correspondence between the sender and the recipient and will not disclose the contents of an online card other than to the intended recipient, except as described in this statement (see Legal Requirements and Investigations above). In addition, an IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you are using your browser on the Internet. The servers that serve our website automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We do log IP addresses, but we do not link the IP addresses to individual accounts or to personally identify our customers for any reason, except in instances of abuse, misuse or unauthorized use of our service. If we, in good faith, determine that you have provided a false email address, used our service to menace, threaten, harass, intimidate or otherwise deceptively posed as another person on our service, your actions will be investigated and your IP address may be disclosed to the recipient of any email, their legal counsel or representatives, and law enforcement officials as part of such an investigation. (See above and Legal Requirements and Investigations). Under normal circumstances, we will not monitor or edit the contents of the online cards you send. On occasion, however, Egreetings personnel may need to view your message in connection with the technical processing of your greeting or the maintenance of our network. Also, if you ask one of our customer service representatives to help you send a card or to verify that a card was sent, that representative will be able to access all information about the card, including the recipient's email address and the message 

"Cookies": 

A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on the users' hard drive containing information about the user. When you visit our site, Egreetings may place a "cookie" on your computer's hard drive in order to improve our service to you by recognizing you when you visit our site. By automatically verifying that your membership or previous usage of the site, the cookie makes it more convenient for you to use Egreetings. Cookies may also be used to compile aggregate information about areas of our site that are visited most frequently. This aggregate traffic information can be used to enhance the content of our site and make your experience more enjoyable. We do not correlate traffic information with data about individual users. Simply put: we may collect data on how many members looked at a particular page, but we do not track which pages you looked at while visiting our site. 

If you've set your browser to reject cookies, you can still use our site, but you may need to re-enter information that we would normally obtain from the cookie (for example, your email address). You can also set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies. If you do, you will receive a warning message each time our site attempts to place a cookie on your hard drive. 

Cookies also may be placed by our advertisers or by independent third parties that actually operate the servers on which the ads reside. We do not have access to or control over these cookies. Although Egreetings encourages all third parties to adhere to appropriate privacy standards and policies, we are not responsible for the actions or policies of such parties. 

Contests, surveys and promotions: 

From time to time, Egreetings sponsors contests, surveys or promotions and allows other companies to sponsor contests or promotions on our site. Participation in such contests, surveys or promotions is completely voluntary. In order to enter a contest or promotion, you may be asked to provide personal identifying information. If you consent by providing the information and entering, such information may be disclosed to the contest's sponsor, whose identity will be clearly indicated on the entry form and in the official rules for each contest or promotion. If Egreetings is the only sponsor of the contest or promotion, information you submit will be treated the same way we would treat your registration information. Other companies who sponsor or co-sponsor our contests and promotions may have their own policies for handling personal information, and information you submit will be subject to those policies as well. We may also give out your address and phone number for the sole purpose of fulfilling a prize for a contest or promotion. Although Egreetings encourages third parties to adhere to appropriate privacy standards and policies, we are not responsible for the actions or policies of such parties. 

Sponsorships: 

Our sponsors and partners also may offer you the opportunity to sign up for their products, services or information, such as fan clubs, newsletters or promotions. In these instances, we will inform you about what specific personal information is requested by the sponsor (such as your email address), and we will ask you for permission to release your information to the sponsor. If you consent, Egreetings will transfer your information to the sponsor. Once your information has been transferred to the sponsor, Egreetings is not responsible for its use. The sponsor's use of the information is governed by the sponsor's privacy policy. While we encourage our third party sponsors to adhere to appropriate privacy standards, we are not responsible for the actions or policies of our sponsors. 

Links: 

Our website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each site they visit that collects personal information. While we carefully choose the websites to which we link, this privacy policy applies solely to information collected on the Egreetings.com website. 

Security 

If you register as a member, we will give you a password to protect your account from abuse by third parties. We encourage you to register as a member as once you have password protection, no one will be able to send cards posing as you or otherwise gain access to your account. You should not disclose your password to anyone else and you are responsible for its secrecy. No one from Egreetings will ever ask you for your password over the phone or in an unsolicited email. 

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' collected information. When users submit personal information via our website, such information will be protected offline and online as described in this statement. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted by our agents and protected with industry standard encryption software. While on a secure page, such as an order form for a digital gift certificate, the lock icon on the bottom of the browser (such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Explorer) becomes locked. 

We, or our agents and partners on our behalf, do everything in our power to protect your information offline as well. Where one of our partners or agents has access to or maintains sensitive personal information, we enter into confidentiality agreements in order to ensure the privacy of such user information. Internally, access to all of our members' personally identifiable information is restricted to those employees who need access in order to fulfill their job responsibilities. Our employees with such access have password-protected computer terminals so that only they may access such information. Furthermore, all Egreetings employees are kept up on various security and privacy practice issues as they arise. 

Finally, the servers for our site are stored in a physically secured facility off site. Beyond the physical security of your information, we also back up our servers regularly to prevent loss of data. While it is our goal to safeguard our users' and members' personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any transmission and your information is submitted at your own risk. If you have questions about our security practices please feel free to send an email to [privacy@egreetings.com](mailto:privacy@egreetings.com)

Notification of changes: 

Egreetings may revise this privacy policy from time to time and reserves the right to do so. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will notify users by posting a prominent announcement on our website so users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and what circumstances, if any, it may be disclosed to a third party. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we would notify users by way of an email. You will still have the opportunity to elect not to have Egreetings use your information in this different manner. We will use your information in accordance with the privacy policy under which it was collected absent permission to do otherwise.
