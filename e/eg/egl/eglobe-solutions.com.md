eGlobe-hotels.com may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services. In addition, if you indicate upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from eGlobe-hotels.com and its partners, eGlobe-hotels.com may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that it feels may be of interest to you.

7\. **Protection of information**

As with all information, eGlobe-hotels will never rent or sell your personal, financial or other information, including information kept in your eGlobe-hotels Portfolio. Any user statistics that we may provide to prospective advertisers or partners regarding financial, product or service usage on eGlobe-hotels are provided in the aggregate form only and does not include any personally identifiable information about any individual user.

Please remember to sign out of your eGlobe-hotels account and close your browser window when you have finished your work.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while eGlobe-hotels strives to protect your personal information, eGlobe-hotels cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to eGlobe-hotels and you do so at your own risk. Once eGlobe-hotels receives your transmission, it makes best efforts to ensure its security on its systems. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online-for example on message boards or through email -that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
