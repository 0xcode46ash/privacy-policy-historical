**_Eglin Federal Credit Union's Commitment to Your Privacy_**

We are committed to taking prudent and reasonable steps to protect the privacy of our members and visitors to this web site. The public areas of this site - everything except [_Home Branch_](https://www.eglinfcu.org/hbhtml/hb_login.htm) \- are open to all visitors to read, search, and download. You can visit this site to find out about our Credit Union, its services and member benefits without providing any information about yourself. If you do provide personal information, such as an address, e-mail, or telephone number when signing our [guest book](http://www.eglinfcu.org/guestbk.htm), or member identification or transaction information in [_Home Branch_](https://www.eglinfcu.org/hbhtml/hb_login.htm), we will maintain this information according to our usual security and confidentiality standards applicable to all member information: 

  * EFCU obeys the letter and spirit of the laws that apply to Credit Union member account information and privacy.
  * We will allow only employees actively engaged in their assigned duties to have access to or use your information. Employees are governed by a code of conduct that includes the responsibility to protect each member's personal information.
  * We may collect and use information only for legitimate business purposes.
  * We will comply with requests to provide information when legally required to do so, for credit reporting, and to prevent fraud.
  * We may share member information with companies that assist us in providing services such as ATM, debit and credit cards; checking accounts; bill paying service; insurance; statement mailing; etc. These business partners will be given only the information they need in order to provide the service. As part of their contract with us they must agree to protect our members' information by meeting our confidentiality requirements. We will disclose the identity of any third-party contractor upon request.
  * Any member who does not want to receive information from our business partners who offer products designed to enhance their financial well-being (such as insurance) may call, write, or e-mail us requesting that they be excluded from any future mailings.



We will protect your privacy on the Internet to the best of our ability. To provide more secure service, we use "cookies" as part of our interaction with your browser. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and computer viruses cannot be transmitted through them. 

To provide you with greater access to information, our site also contains links to other sites. While we hope these organizations join us in respecting your privacy, EFCU is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these other web sites.
