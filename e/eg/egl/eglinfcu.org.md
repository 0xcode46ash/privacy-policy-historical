Eglin Federal Credit Union's Commitment to Your Privacy

We are committed to providing services and products to meet the financial needs and goals of our membership. At times, gathering information is fundamental to our ability to provide such services. Protecting your personal information and using it in a trustworthy manner is a high priority for everyone associated with Eglin Federal Credit Union (EFCU). 

As a member you also have a responsibility to safeguard your financial information. You should protect your personal identification and any access device we provide per your request; immediately report the compromise, loss or theft of those items. You should carefully review the account statements we send you and report any unauthorized transactions. 

We are committed to taking reasonable steps to protect the privacy of EFCU members in all areas of our operations. So that you can rely upon the quality of products and services we make available, we stand behind the following privacy policy: 

  * EFCU obeys the letter and spirit of the laws that apply to Credit Union member account information and privacy.

We collect nonpublic information about you from some or all of the following sources: information we receive from you on applications; information about your transactions with us; and information we receive from a consumer reporting agency. 
  * We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with Federal regulations and conform to leading industry practices to protect the information in our files and computers.
