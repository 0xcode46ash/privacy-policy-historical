# Privacy Policy - The E-goi platform - E-GOI

This E-goi privacy statement is intended to demonstrate our firm and continuing commitment to the privacy of personal information.  
E-goi complies with internationally recognised standards of privacy protection and will endeavour to ensure that personal information provided by those interacting with E-goi, both directly (as E-goi users) and indirectly (as distribution list addressees), is used responsibly and appropriately.

We will never sell, rent, share or otherwise make available your personal information and distribution lists with any third party unless compelled by law.

E-goi provides you with a web-based software application allowing e-mail and SMS list management, HTML message design and delivery statistical analysis. However, you are solely responsible for the contents of both your distribution lists and the messages sent out to those lists under the terms of the E-goi [ Anti-Spam Policy](http://www.e-goi.com/the-e-goi-platform/anti-spam-policy/mc_doc_en_22/), which you acknowledge to have read, understood and accepted.

The contents of E-goi distribution lists and messages sent to those lists may be monitored for troubleshooting or maintenance purposes or if any form of mailing abuse is suspected.

We will not change, modify, or edit any distribution list or the contents of any message you send unless you specifically and explicitly request such modifications and grant us written consent to those modifications.

We provide additional newsletter design services to meet specific mailing needs you may have. However, refunds do not apply once you have approved a newsletter design.

Our privacy practices are further described in the following topics:

 **WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND TRACK**

Information you submit to us is only available to employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or sending messages based on your request for information. 

We may gather aggregate statistics about your traffic patterns. These statistics do not include any personally identifying information and enable us to serve E-goi users and site visitors more efficiently.

Messages you send using E-goi must only be sent to recipients who have an existing business relationship with you and have expressly shared their contact information for the purpose of receiving information in the future.

 **CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

We reserve the right to add to or change the terms of this Privacy Policy in our sole discretion without prior notice to you. If this Privacy Policy is changed, the new Privacy Policy will be posted on this website and it will become effective from the time of posting to the website.
