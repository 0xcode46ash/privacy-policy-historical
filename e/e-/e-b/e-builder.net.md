You can do so without providing us with any information. However, we collect the domain names (not the e-mail addresses) of all visitors to measure site analytics such as the number of visits, pages visited, average time spent on the site, etc.

Like many other Internet sites, our site may make use of "cookie or pixel" technology to measure site activity and to customize information.  A cookie/pixel is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, allowing us to target key messages and offers to you when you are online.  You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie/pixel, however please note that by not accepting cookies/pixels from our site, you may limit the functionality we can provide.

If you choose to provide us with personal information, for example by filling out a form to receive information or to sign up for an event, you are agreeing to share that information with e-Builder. We will never share or sell your information with third parties, affiliates or business partners.

As a e-Builder customer, you will be given a login ID and confidential password to be able to take full advantage of e-Builder Enterprise. We may also use your contact information to reach you regarding information on the product or your services.  You may unsubscribe from any email communication at any time.   

e-Builder may also disclose account information if or when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating e-Builder's Terms of Service or intellectual property rights. The same policy applies in cases where we believe an individual may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) e-Builder's rights or property, other users of a site or service, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. e-Builder may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.

Our Site may include links to the websites of our business partners, vendors and advertisers. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies of that third party. We are unsure whether these third parties have privacy policies similar to ours, and therefore, e-Builder cannot be responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by any third party. Please review the privacy policies of these third parties.
