# E-xact Transactions Ltd. - Privacy Statement

E-xact Transactions Ltd. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to consumer rights to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: [www.e-xact.com](http://www.e-xact.com/)

  **Information We Collect & How it’s Used**   
Because we are a certified transaction processor we strongly uphold the privacy and security of our clients’ information which includes banking, credit card, and merchant account information. Such information is kept exclusively between our clients, E-xact Transactions, and our processing resources.

  **Information You Explicitly Provide** **via Information Request**   
We make available company literature for customers who request it, should they prefer not to download this information and/or want our print literature. We require your consent via our Information Request form or email.

**via Members’ Login**   
Access to the Member’s Area of E-xact's website requires active membership with E-xact Transactions. Valid username and password are required to enter and this area is SSL secured. A demo account (for testing purposes only) is available for individuals who register for it. Contact information to register for the demo include name, email address, phone number, address, fax number, and domain names. Registration information is used to send email "thank yous" and enable the demo for the user. This information is not shared with anyone outside of E-xact unless verbal or written permission is given by the E-xact member.

**Information We Automatically Collect** **IP Addresses**   
E-xact’s website logs IP addresses and browser types for systems administration purposes and these logs will be analyzed to improve the value of the materials available on the website. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user’s session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.

  **Cookies**   
E-xact’s website is cookie free, with the exception of our Members' Only area where cookies are used for security purposes. 

**Sharing of Information  
**This site does not supplement the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties. The only time information is shared is during your registration with E-xact for our services as this process requires third party involvement (i.e. your bank, your developer, and your possible E-xact partner affiliates). E-xact does not take responsibility or liability for how third parties secure your information once it has been passed on.

**Security**   
Protecting your privacy and information is a top priority at E-xact. We have taken careful measures to secure your information and our physical premises. This website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Our registration and Members’ areas have SSL protection and Verisign has supplied us with a digital certificate for our website. All personal and company data referring to account applications and registration is kept in strictest confidence and security.

  **External Links  
**The E-xact website contains links to other websites and [www.e-xact.com](http://www.e-xact.com/) is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

**E-mail Links**   
We use email links located throughout our website to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have. We read every message sent in and try to reply promptly to each one.
