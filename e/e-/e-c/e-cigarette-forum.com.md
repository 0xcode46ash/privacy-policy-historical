# Privacy Policy

**Data**

We use technologies like cookies (small files stored by your browser), web beacons, or unique device identifiers to anonymously identify your computer or device so we can deliver a better experience. Our systems also log information like your browser, operating system and IP address.

We do not collect personally identifiable information about you. In other words, we do not collect information such as your name, address, phone number.

We do collect email addresses as part of the registration process, and if you do not opt out of receiving admin emails either during the registration process or via your user Control Panel, we may send you emails updating you with news and offers. We will never sell or share your email address with third parties, with the exception of 3rd parties that provide a platform for sending our emails to you.

We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18 - our service is for over 18s only. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly remove the information.

**Location**

We collect your general geographic location (Town/City) but not your precise location (Street, Building), as part of our web analytics. This is not linked to any of your other personal information such as your ECF Username, Facebook Profile, or your Browser, Operating System or IP address, and is only used to give us a general idea as to where our visitors are visiting from.

**Access**

You can sign into your account to see any personally identifiable information we have stored, such as your Username or email address.

**Deletion**

If you request your account to be deleted, we will do so promptly. However, to maintain site integrity, any content you have contributed may be kept, with your Username removed. Your content will be attributed to 'guest'.

**Sharing**

We generally do not share personally identifiable information (such as name, address, email or phone) with other companies.

**Ad Tracking**

We do not allow advertising companies to collect data through our service for ad targeting. However, we do use geotargetting to serve you ads relevant to your location.

**Contact**

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policies, please contact us: [e-cigarette-forum.com/infozone/ecf-forum-manager-contact-form.html](http://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/infozone/ecf-forum-manager-contact-form.html)

**Security**

We take reasonable steps to secure your personally identifiable information against unauthorized access or disclosure. We encrypt transmission of data on pages where you provide payment information. However, no security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error.

Information we collect may be stored or processed on computers located in any country where we do business.

**More**

This privacy policy was last updated on March 5th 2013. Our privacy policy may change from time to time.

If the change materially affects registered users, we will send a notice to you by email.
