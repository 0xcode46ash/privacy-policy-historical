# Privacy policy - ECAL

**1\. Introduction**

ECAL is a free service that allows users to receive digital calendar information (in the form of an **Event** , **Date  **or **Schedule** ) via subscription into their personal digital calendar ( **Calendar** ). The information within each unique event in a user’s Calendar ( **Event** ) can be changed by the third party source publisher of the Schedule ( **Publisher** ) or by E-DIARY Pty Ltd.

ECAL is owned and operated worldwide by E-DIARY Pty Ltd ( **EPL** ). This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect in connection with the ECAL service and how we use and disclose it. By providing personal information to us or using the service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We take the privacy and security of our customer information very seriously and we are committed to ensuring that we collect, use, disclose and store your information in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws.

We also follow our own ECAL contact policy (“contact standards”), and ask our Publishers to also follow our contact standards and this Privacy Policy, which means we will endeavour to ensure that information sent directly to your Calendar (whether by the Publisher or EPL) is ‘specific and relevant’ to you (based on your known profile) or one of your Schedules or Events.

Additionally, EPL does not have access to any other information in your personal Calendar, including your private events, meetings, appointments, etc., other than Events and Schedules that you have subscribed to using the ECAL service.

We may vary this Privacy Policy from time to time, the most recent version can always be accessed at [www.ecal.com](http://www.ecal.com/). Any changes will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy at [www.ecal.com](http://www.ecal.com/).

  * **Information you provide us** – Personal information that you provide to us (for example, during registration or subscribing for a particular Schedule) including but not limited to: your name, email address, telephone number, physical address, birth date, gender, country or postcode.
  * **Usage information** – We may receive and store certain types of information relating to your usage of the ECAL service. For example, we may collect data relating to you subscribing to a Schedule, opening, accepting or declining specific Events within a Schedule, the Calendar software platform you are using, device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number), click-stream data, your location, browser fingerprints, the Calendar and browser’s communication with our servers and information from your social networks if you use our social/‘single sign on’ We may also use audience and traffic measurement services that allow us (and Publishers and our third party marketing agencies and partners) to collect anonymous traffic and behavioral information from the ECAL service by monitoring anonymous visitor activity through the use of cookies and other technologies.
  * **Information from other sources** – We may receive information about you from other online and offline sources (including publicly available social network information) and add it to your personal information.



We aim to continually improve the service we offer, and the information we collect allows us to tailor our service to best suit you.

**4\. With whom we share your information**

At times, we may share your personal information with others for various purposes.

  * **Publishers:** We may provide your personal information to the Publisher(s) relating to the particular Schedule(s) that you have subscribed to via the ECAL service.

  * **Suppliers and agents:** We may employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include system analysis, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, sending communications and providing customer service.
