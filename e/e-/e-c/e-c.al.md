# Privacy Policy | ECAL

Last updated October 2014

****1\. Introduction****

ECAL is a free service that allows users to receive digital calendar information via subscription (in the form of an **Event** , **Date** or **Schedule** ) shown on a website or app into their personal digital calendar ( **Calendar** ). The information within each unique event in a user’s Calendar ( **Event** ) can be changed by E-DIARY Pty Ltd or the third party source publisher of the Schedule ( **Publisher** )

ECAL is owned and operated worldwide by E-DIARY Pty Ltd ( **EPL** ). We take the privacy and security of our customer information very seriously and we are committed to ensuring that we collect, use, disclose and store your information in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws.

Participation and use of the ECAL service is voluntary. If you no longer wish to receive Event-related information (including ads), you can delete your Schedule subscription anytime from within the settings in your personal Calendar and cancel the ECAL service.

We also follow our own ECAL contact policy (“contact standards”) which means we will only ever send Event-related information directly to your Calendar if it is deemed, in our sole opinion, ‘specific and relevant’ to you (based on your known profile) or one of your Schedules or Events.

We may vary this Privacy Policy from time to time, the most recent version can always be accessed at [www.ecal.com](http://www.ecal.com/ "www.ecal.com").
