# eHealthcare Solutions Privacy Policy

**Overview**

eHealthcare Solutions, LLC (EHS) is committed to protecting the privacy of our users (referred to as either “you” or “Users”). EHS uses its best efforts to ensure that the information you submit directly to EHS remains private and is used only for the purposes as set forth herein.

**Applicability of Policy**

This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected from you or submitted by you on the EHS website, where the information is submitted directly to EHS. The policy is not applicable to EHS partner websites. Each participating EHS partner website may have its own privacy policy, which we encourage you to read and understand. EHS has no authority over any partner website’s individual privacy policy.

**General Information Collected**

First and foremost, EHS does not automatically obtain any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address, when you visit our website unless you voluntarily provide such information. EHS may, however, automatically collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type (for example, Firefox or Internet Explorer), and the Web pages you visited. This non-personally identifiable information collected by EHS is used for the purpose of improving the EHS website to make it more useful to you.

**User Specific Information Collection**

EHS occasionally asks for personal information to fulfill your requests for contact or more information. Whenever EHS asks for such personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, email address, etc.), we will clearly disclose what information is required, what information is optional, and how that information may be used.

**Limitations on Disclosures**

Personally identifiable information in the EHS database will not be sold or disclosed to any merchant, advertiser or Web publisher. However, EHS does disclose aggregate information, which does not identify individuals or any personally identifiable information, to business partners, advertisers and other third parties. EHS also reserves the right to use such non-personally identifiable information gathered on the EHS website for promoting EHS products and services.

**Cookies, Beacons, Mobile & Other tracking**

EHS, along with thousands of other websites, uses cookies, beacons and other tracking mechanisms to enhance your Web-viewing experience across various devices. Tracking mechanisms such as cookies are small files that your Web browser places on your computer’s hard drive to collect information about you such as what page you are viewing. EHS cookies do not damage your system or files in any way. Cookies work as follows: When you log on to the EHS website, or one of our partner sites for whom we deliver advertising, EHS assigns you a unique number and records that number in the cookie file of your computer. Then, when you visit again, EHS reads this number to help gain information about your use of our website. EHS cookies may be associated with some personal information about you, if you have registered for an EHS service or have registered with one of our partners who shares data with EHS to improve advertising targeting.

While we believe that cookies enhance your Web experience with EHS, you have the option of setting your Web browser to reject cookies. However, doing so may negatively impact the performance of the website. You also have the option to opt-out of interest-based targeting from eHealthcare Solutions, that is targeting that is driven based on the content of the webpages you visited in the past, by [clicking here and completing the opt-out process](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?type=ehs&affiliateId=154).

**Child Privacy**

EHS does not specifically or intentionally collect information about children. If you are concerned about your child’s use of the websites, you may use Web filtering technology to supervise and limit access to websites.

**Changes to Privacy Statement**

This Privacy Statement may be updated from time to time. Changes to this Privacy Statement will be posted by EHS on its website. It is your obligation to review this Privacy Statement from time to time, and your continued use of the EHS website after changes have been posted will be deemed to be your acceptance of the revised Statement. If at any time you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Statement, you may contact EHS via email at info@EHSmail.com.

**Security**

EHS will maintain the confidentiality of the information that it collects during your visit to the EHS website. EHS maintains internal practices that help to protect the security and confidentiality of this information by limiting employee access to and use of this information.

**General**

This Privacy Statement is governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New Jersey, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Jurisdiction for any claims arising under the terms and conditions of this Privacy Statement shall lie exclusively with the state and federal courts of the State of New Jersey. If any provision of this Privacy Statement is found to be invalid by a court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Privacy Statement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

Privacy Statement last updated, August 2012.
