1. Our approach
Eclipse Internet takes the privacy of its users seriously. Generally, you can browse through our
Website without giving us any information about yourself (including your email address). When we
do need your personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to
provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your
personal information.
If we decide to change our privacy policy for this Website, we will post those changes here so that
you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether
we will disclose it to anyone.
                                                                                   Back to table of contents
2. Information collection
We collect personal information (such as your name, email address and any other details you
provide to us that identifies you as an individual) from you when you submit a request for
information or when you submit your details for any other reason. Personal information will only be
collected with your consent.
When you browse our Website, we may also log your IP address (the Internet address of your
computer) to give us an idea of which part of our Website you visit and how long you spend here.
We do not link your IP address to any other personal information that you send to us. Like many
other websites, we may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about
how you use the Website (see section 6. Cookies)
Save for the use of cookies, we do not automatically log data or collect data apart from information
you specifically provide to us.
                                                                                   Back to table of contents

We (and other KCOM Group companies) will use your information for several general purposes

                                                                                  Back to table of contents
4. Who may process data
Your personal information may be processed both by us and by other companies within our group
in accordance with this privacy policy. We take all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised
access to your personal data. Personal information will not be sold or transferred to unaffiliated
third parties without your prior consent.
Where any personal information is processed by us, we will comply with relevant Data Protection
legislation at all times. We are registered to process data under the Data Protection Act (our

5. Security measures
We are serious about guarding the security of your personal information that we have under our
control from unauthorised access, improper use and disclosure, unauthorised destruction or
accidental loss. However we cannot guarantee the protection of your personal data as due to the
nature of the Internet, the Website is theoretically accessible by any user of the World Wide Web.
You should be aware that when you disclose personal information on the Website it may be
collected by another user and may result in unsolicited messages from other Internet users.
                                                                                  Back to table of contents

6.1 What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small text file that may be placed on your computers hard-drive when you visit a
website so that the site can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the
domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a
randomly generated unique number. The only personal information a cookie can contain is the
information that you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data from your hard disk or read any
other cookie files created by other websites.

http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.
6.2 How we use cookies
We use cookies which are generated by a third party to enable us to track user trends in
association with web beacons (see section 7. What is a web beacon?) to ensure the website is
structured in a user friendly manner. The cookies that are issued merely contain a unique number
and therefore contain no personal data. They have a lifetime of 5 years. Data collected by cookies
will not otherwise be passed to any third party, the data is kept for internal use only. Our cookies
will not be used to analyse your visits to other sites.
You have options with regards to cookies. By changing the settings of your browser, you may opt
to accept cookies, to be informed when a cookie is being placed on your PC or to reject all cookies.

you can voluntarily choose not to visit a site or areas of a site that use cookies.
To be alerted prior to accepting cookies, you may choose to follow one of these procedures (the
following is only a brief list of some popular browsers):
•          If you are using Netscape Navigator 3.0, go to the "Options" menu, then to "Network
           Preferences," and then to "Protocols." Check the box that says, "Show an alert before
           accepting a cookie."
•          In Netscape 4.0+, go to "Edit" in the menu bar, then to "Preferences," then to "Advanced."
           Check the box that says, "Warn me before accepting a cookie."
•          In Netscape 6.0, go to "Edit" in the menu bar, then to "Preferences," then to "Advanced,"
           then to "Cookies." Check the box that says, "Warn me before accepting a cookie."
•          In Internet Explorer 3.0, go to the "View" menu, then to "Options," then to "Advanced."
           Check the box that says, "Warn before accepting cookies."
•          In Internet Explorer 4.0, go to the "View" menu, then to "Internet Options," then to
           "Advanced." Check the box that says, "Prompt before accepting cookies."
•          In Internet Explorer 5.0+, go to the "Tools" menu, then to "Internet Options," then to
           "Security," then to "Custom Level." In the "Cookies" section, go to the "Allow cookies that
           are stored on your machine" sub-section and select "Prompt."
                                                                                   Back to table of contents
