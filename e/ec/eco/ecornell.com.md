# Privacy Policy | eCornell

eCornell is committed to protecting your privacy. The following Privacy Policy describes what information we collect from you when you visit this site, and how we use this information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our privacy practices.

**The Information eCornell Collects**  
** ** eCornell collects two kinds of information on this site: (1) registration information that is voluntarily supplied by visitors to this site who enroll in the programs offered through eCornell and (2) tracking information that is automatically collected as visitors navigate through this site.

If you choose to register for enrollment in one or more programs offered through eCornell, you will be required to provide certain enrollment information that we need to process your application for enrollment. This site automatically recognizes and records certain non-personal information, including the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com or cornell.edu); the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and the operating system; the date and time you access this site; and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to this site. We may use cookies to keep track of your preferences and profile information. Cookies are small files which are stored on a user’s computer. They are designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular client and website, and can be accessed either by the web server or the client computer. This allows the server to deliver a page tailored to a particular user, or the page itself can contain some script which is aware of the data in the cookie and so is able to carry information from one visit to the website (or related site) to the next. Cookies are also used to collect general usage and volume statistical information that does not include personal information.

Your data is used for purposes that you expect it to be used for such as fulfilling your order or providing services you requested. This may include providing you personalized content, features to enable you to interact with others, securing your data, and communicating about, improving, or troubleshooting the products or services being provided. We collect the following personal information from you:

  * Contact Information such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number
  * Billing Information such as credit card number, and billing address



We do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of 13 years.

As is true of most Web sites, we automatically gather information about your computer such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system.

We use this information to:

  * Fulfill your order

  * Send you an order confirmation

  * Send you requested product or service information

  * Send product updates or warranty information

  * Respond to customer service requests

  * Administer your account

  * Respond to your questions and concerns




**Correcting and Updating Your Personal Information**  
** ** To review and update your personal information to ensure it is accurate, contact us at helpdesk@ecornell.com.

**Marketing Communications**  
You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or you can [unsubscribe here](mailto:helpdesk@ecornell.com).

**Third-party Vendors  
**Third-party vendors, including Google, show eCornell ads on sites on the internet using cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to eCornell’s website.  eCornell uses analytics data to also inform and optimize ad campaigns based on a user’s prior visits.  You may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the [Google advertising](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/) opt-out page. In addition, you may also opt out of a third party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) opt out page as well as opt out of our use of Google Analytics by visiting the [Google Analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) Opt-out page.  eCornell may have reporting of their aggregate interactions with our ads across the Google Display Network or DoubleClick for Advertisers in conjunction with activity on our site.

**How eCornell Uses This Information  
**We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We share your registration information with Cornell University, which will use it as a part of your enrollment in programs offered through eCornell. In addition, we may provide aggregated statistical data to reputable third-party vendors, but this data will include no personally identifying information. We may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of eCornell, Cornell University, our users, or others. We may also release information to your employer, if your enrollment is through a corporate agreement and disclosure is needed to comply with the employer’s request for information, and to any third party administrator, if your enrollment is through this third party administrator and disclosure is needed to comply with the third party administrator’s request for information. Customer data is retained by eCornell for as long as necessary to maintain business operations related to customer activities.  In the event of bankruptcy or insolvency, all customer data would be destroyed. Customer data is retained by eCornell for as long as necessary to maintain business operations related to customer activities, 24 months after the last date of activity on the account. In the event of a merger, all customer data will be transferred to the new organization/entity. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency, all customer data would be destroyed.

**How eCornell Protects Your Information  
**When you log in or use your credit card with us, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. As effective as encryption technology is, however, no security system is completely impenetrable, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the lnternet.

**Your Consent  
**By using this website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by eCornell and by Cornell University for the purpose of your enrollment in programs offered through eCornell. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page before the changes take effect. Of course, our use of information gathered while the current policy is in effect will always be consistent with the current policy, even if we change that policy later. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

**Dispute Resolution  
**If you and eCornell don’t resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.

In accordance with our commitment to protect personal privacy, eCornell adheres to the principles of the Safe Harbor Framework as developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission.

The seven principles and fifteen Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) referred to in this policy constitute Safe Harbor privacy framework. These principles and FAQs may be found at: <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>
