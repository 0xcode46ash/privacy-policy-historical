## N. U.S. – EU and U.S – Switzerland Safe Harbor Participation

Personal Data collected in the European Union (“EU”) is subject to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) and similarly Switzerland has adopted a data protection law (together the “Data Privacy Laws”). The U.S. Department of Commerce has agreed separately with the European Commission and the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland upon similar sets of data protection principles (“Safe Harbor Privacy Principles”) and frequently asked questions (the “U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework” and the “U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework”) to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under the Data Privacy Laws that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EU or Switzerland to the United States. 

Ecolab complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Ecolab has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, access, security, data integrity, and enforcement.

More information about Safe Harbor program and Ecolab’s certification can be found at the U.S. Department website http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/. Individuals in the EU and Switzerland may contact the Ecolab Safe Harbor Privacy Contact identified below to review the Personal Data that Ecolab holds about them. If an individual in the EU or Switzerland cannot resolve an issue concerning his/her Personal Data, such individual can contact the local data protection authority for assistance.
