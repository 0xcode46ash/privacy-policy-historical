EconoTimes is a fast growing non-partisan source of news and intelligence on global economy and financial markets, providing timely, relevant, and critical insights for market professionals and those who want to make informed investment decisions.

Traditional news outlets can be reactive rather than proactive. Our core belief is that investors demand ideology-agnostic and "smart beta" news in a growing decentralized multi-speed world.

Our credibility for delivering insightful information has been built over last 5 years by a global network of analysts. Our reporters include former fixed-income and currency traders and experts, rather than sell-side analysts. Expert analysts convey the key market moving news and events in the shortest and most succinct format possible.

Trading in the futures and foreign exchange markets on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all individuals. The high degree of leverage offered in the Forex markets can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to trade in the foreign exchange markets you should carefully consider your investment objectives, your level of experience, and your risk appetite.

The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your equity and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. Only true discretionary cash should be used in trading. You should make yourself aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any questions or concerns as to how a loss would affect your lifestyle.
