# Ecosia - Privacy

Ecosia holds your privacy in the highest regard. The collected information merely serves to remove fake searches and are completely deleted within 48 hours. To protect your privacy, the data is not further analyzed, sold, or given to a third party. Ecosia’s search results are obtained through Bing Search and Yahoo Search, whose privacy provisions are therefore relevant to your search.

### Collection and Use of Information

During every search, Ecosia saves a limited amount of information provided by your browser. This includes your IP address, browser type and language, the date and time of your search, as well as one or more cookies. Ecosia’s contract with Bing and Yahoo specifies that we have to pass along your IP address and browser type after every search. Ecosia deletes this data immediately after sending it to them. You can learn more about our partner’s privacy provisions directly: [Bing](http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/bing.mspx) and [Yahoo](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/). Ecosia generally has no control over the search results or the links that show up on pages.

If you contact us via email or telephone, we will save the information given to us in order to process your request and improve our services. Your personal information will not be used further or given to a third party without your permission. 

### Cookies

Upon visiting ecosia.org, a cookie will be sent to your computer to determine the browser type, country, and language being used. It then collects your personal settings, such as whether or not an adult filter is activated or a page preview. Additionally, the cookie will leave a tracking number (Track ID). This is an arbitrary number that serves to remove fake searches and preserve your confidentiality. Ecosia deletes this number without any further analysis within 48 hours.

Most browsers accept cookies in their default settings. You can however set your browser to refuse all cookies. In this case, it is possible that some of Ecosia’s services will not function perfectly. 

### Data Security

Ecosia has adopted appropriate security measures to protect data from unauthorized acccess, changes, transfer, or deletion. 

### Changes to Security Provisions

Please be aware that the security provisions are subject to change. Every change will be posted on this page, and you will be notified directly of any important changes that may occur. All versions of the security provisions can be identified the day they enter into force.
