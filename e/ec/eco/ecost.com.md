If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp).

[Return to Top](https://web.archive.org/web/20061224042101id_/http%3A//www.ecost.com/ecost/information/help/getting_started.asp#pp)

**How We Use the Personal Information We Collect**

We use the PII that you provide to us in order to 1) fulfill requests for products, services and/or information, 2) provide customer service, 3) offer new products or services, 4) measure and improve the effectiveness of our Site and our marketing endeavors, 5) tailor our online offerings to your preferences, 6) administer promotions or surveys, and 7) achieve other business purposes as permitted under applicable law.

When you make a purchase on our Site we collect credit card information including card number, card type, cardholder name and billing address, and expiration date, in order to bill you for purchases made through ECOST. Please review our [Credit Card Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20061224042101id_/http%3A//www.ecost.com/ecost/information/help/payment_information.asp#a) for additional information.

ECOST may disclose PII to consultants, professional advisors and contractors who perform services on our behalf, but only to the extent necessary for them to perform such services. At times, ECOST may seek to validate the PII we have collected via an audit by a third party designed to determine the accuracy of and/or to update the information collected. We may also combine data that we collect online with data collected offline (such as through purchases made through one of our catalogs), or with data provided by other parties.

ECOST shares PII collected from our visitors and customers with our affiliated or related companies, including its parent company, affiliates, subsidiaries, or its parent company’s other subsidiaries.  
ECOST reserves the right to release PII concerning any visitor when that visitor is believed by ECOST to be in violation of any published guidelines for the use of the Site, or participates (or is suspected of participating) in any illegal or potentially illegal activity. ECOST also reserves the right to disclose PII to comply with applicable law, in response to civil subpoenas or discovery requests, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is required to protect the rights, property, safety or security of ECOST, our visitors or the public, or to respond to an emergency.

In the event that we sell or otherwise transfer to a third party assets related either (a) to the Site or (b) to one or more of our businesses, divisions or affiliated companies, we reserve the right to also transfer any and all information (including any PII) associated with the Site and/or any business, division or affiliated company to such third party. However, all PII transferred to such third party shall be transferred subject to the usage restrictions contained in ECOST’s privacy policy. Please note that we are not responsible for retracting your PII from any third parties with whom we have shared your information pursuant to the terms of this Policy.

**Marketing Communications: Opting Out**

When you provide PII to us, including when registering to receive email newsletters, catalog subscriptions or other information, or to make a purchase, ECOST provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of having your information used for marketing communications. Unless you have opted out of receiving such communications, ECOST may use your PII to forward you, via email or mail, advertisements concerning ECOST products, services, special promotions, surveys or other opportunities from ECOST that we think may be of interest to you. Such email advertisements may also concern third party companies’ products and services, including companies in industries such as hardware and software, and other providers of the types of products that are sold or featured on the Site. 

ECOST has partnered with third parties to offer our customers and Site visitors a variety of products and services. Other than as set forth herein, we will not sell or lease your email address to third party advertisers to solicit you directly. However ECOST may share PII (such as your physical mailing address - but not your email address) with our marketing partners in order for them to offer you additional products and services that ECOST believes may be of interest to you. Although we only work with third parties whom we believe to be reputable, our marketing partners may have different privacy policies and practices than ECOST. We encourage you to review our marketing partners’ privacy policies to further understand their procedures for collecting, using and disclosing your information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our marketing partners or any other third parties. If you decide that you would like to discontinue receiving promotional materials from these or any third parties, please contact them directly.

Should you wish to change your preferences regarding the information that you receive from ECOST or its affiliates, or would prefer that we not share PII with our marketing partners, please refer to the paragraph below entitled “Correcting/Updating Your Personal Information and Preferences.” Please note that we are not responsible for retracting your PII from any third parties with whom we have shared your information pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Policy.

**Cookies**

Upon visiting our Site we will assign you a unique ID in the form of a "cookie". A cookie is a piece of information that our server places on your computer’s hard drive, which ECOST may associate with your PII when you log on to the site. Cookies are used for such purposes as facilitating and personalizing your shopping and ordering experience, keeping track of your shopping basket during your visit, helping diagnose problems with our server, and administering our Site. We may use the information collected through cookies for marketing purposes to inform you of special offers, better understand your needs or answer your questions.  NOTE: You can control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser, and you may remove them from your computer at any time at your discretion.

**Web Beacons**

Some ECOST Web pages and HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters may use Web beacons to compile aggregate statistics about website usage. A Web beacon is an electronic image, often called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF, that is ordinarily not visible to the site visitor. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a visitor's computer, such as a visitor's cookie number, time and date of a page or image view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. When used in an e-mail, they can tell us whether an e-mail has been opened.

**How We Protect Your Personal Information**

To help ensure the confidentiality of your PII, ECOST seeks to use security technology and procedures, which are reviewed periodically. We use encryption technology and Secure Socket Layers (“SSL”) in all areas where your personal and account information is required. This means that the personal information you submit to us via our Site is encrypted by your computer, and then decrypted again on our side, discouraging others from accessing your private information during transmission. If your browser does not support SSL, or if you are unable to establish a secure connection due to a company firewall, please call us at (877) 888-2678 to place your order by phone.

In addition, your personal, account information, and transaction history are kept behind our firewall.

**Correcting/Updating Your Personal Information and Preferences**

If you would like to have your PII removed from ECOST’s databases, or to make changes to your PII or to your preferences regarding the use of your PII for marketing purposes, please [ click here](https://web.archive.org/ecost/information/subscription_services/default~page~showtext.asp). We will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. Please note that we may need to contact you in order to be sure that we are updating the appropriate information. When requesting that PII be updated or that your preferences be changed, please keep in mind that until the change is implemented, you may still receive email and/or physical mailings from us. Furthermore, there will be residual information that will remain within ECOST databases, access logs and other records, which may contain such PII. The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however, ECOST reserves the right, from time to time, to recontact former customers or visitors to the Site. Please note that we are not responsible for retracting your PII from third parties with whom we have shared your information pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Policy.

**Other Information We Collect**

_Information About Your Computer and Your Site Activities:_ When a visitor comes to our Site we collect and aggregate information about the visitor’s computer (such as its IP address, operating system and browser software), and click-stream information (such as the address (or “URL”) of the Web site that the visitor came from before visiting our Site, which pages of the Site were visited, the order in which they were visited and which hyperlinks were clicked) for the purpose of assessing our Site traffic and the effectiveness of our Site content, as well as to help diagnose problems with our servers. This data allows us to improve the quality of your visit by streamlining your ability to navigate the Site, and to develop featured programs and content that will be of interest to our customers and Site visitors. 

_Aggregated Information:_ ECOST may collect and aggregate demographic information about our Site visitors. For example, we may seek to aggregate information regarding the gender make-up, average age and range of income levels of Site visitors in order to better service our user community. We may use such information in its aggregated form without restriction. 

_Information About Corporate and Other Organizational Customers:_ We may collect information pertaining solely to corporations, governmental or educational entities, or other business or not for profit entities, such as, for example, a company's address. We may use any such corporate information without restriction. In an effort to better support our customers by delivering more relevant marketing communications, ECOST will, on occasion, purchase third party information about businesses and other entities that are our customers. The company information we purchase may include number of employees, or annual sales volume and company structure. This is used to customize such customers’ online/offline experience and to supplement our internal sales information to better serve you.

**Advertisers**

ECOST may use outside advertising companies ("Advertisers") to serve advertisements on the Site. Please be advised that such Advertisers may use cookies or other technologies to enable such Advertisers to record which ads your browser has seen, and which Site pages you may have been viewing when the ads were delivered.

**Sweepstakes and Promotions**

We may from time to time offer sweepstakes, contests, or other similar promotions on the Site. Additional PII may be required in order to participate in such promotions, so that we may, for example, verify entrants' eligibility and identity and notify winners. Participation in such promotions is completely voluntary. If and when we sponsor such promotions, we will post relevant privacy information in the respective "official rules" and/or registration areas for such promotions. That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Policy, will govern that particular sweepstakes, contest or promotion—please remember to read it carefully.

Other companies may offer sweepstakes, contests or similar promotions through our Site, including through the Rebates & Coupons page. ECOST is not responsible for any such promotions offered by third parties. Please read all related terms and conditions carefully, or contact the applicable third party for more information. The collection and use of personal information in connection with such promotions is governed by such third party’s privacy policy, and not by the policies of ECOST.

**Co-branded Sites: Links to Other Sites**
