 **How do we use the information we collect?**  
To protect your privacy, we pledge to keep the personal information that you provide to us secure and private. Our agreements with business partners, agents, and affiliates have strict confidentiality and security provisions and we require our employees to affirm the confidential nature of your information and not share it with any third party.

We do not sell, trade, rent, or release your personal information to anyone outside our company, contractors, and affiliates, other than in compliance with this privacy and security policy. We, our franchisees, and our affiliates use the personal information you provide voluntarily to administer our business activities, provide customer service, contact you concerning your stay with us, and make other products and services available to you. Your information may be combined with information about you which we gathered from other sources. We share your information with our franchisees, credit card issuers, and other companies where necessary to complete your transaction. We may also use your information to send you promotional communications by mail or e-mail, or share your information with our business partners.

To the extent required or permitted by law, we may collect, use and disclose personal information in connection with security-related or law enforcement investigations or in the course of cooperating with authorities or complying with legal requirements. We may also use your information as permitted by law to perform credit checks, report or collect debts owed, or protect the rights or property of Choice, our employees, our customers, this site, or its users.

 **What about cookies and transparent gifs?**  
We use cookies to keep track of your preferences and activities during your visits (for example, customizing the site to show the brand that you originally typed in). We do not use cookies to ascertain any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with Choice Hotels. Cookies do not corrupt or damage your computer, programs, or computer files. You can set your browser to reject cookies if you have further concerns although doing so may adversely affect your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality, and access certain content on our Web site.

We use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage our online advertising. These files enable us and our advertising partner to recognize unique codes on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

 **How is the information collected online protected?**  
When you provide us with information through this site, such as your name, address, phone number, credit card information and room preference, your information will be encrypted using a Secured Sockets Layer. You can tell if your information is encrypted by looking for the locked padlock icon on the lower right-hand or left-hand corner of your screen and a change in the site address from "http" to "https." Once your information reaches us, we store it behind a secure firewall that blocks access from outside our server.

 **Does this policy cover other sites linked from ChoiceHotels.com?**  
ChoiceHotels.com contains links to other websites. Those sites are not covered by this privacy and security policy, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other sites.

 **What about changes to the Privacy and Security Policy?**  
By using our site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this policy. We reserve the right to modify this privacy and security policy and related business practices at any time by posting updated text on this site.

 **What if there's a difference between versions of the Privacy and Security Policy?**  
As a service to our customers, we make this privacy and security policy available in several different languages. In the event of any discrepancies between the various translations of the policy, the English version of the policy is the authoritative one.
