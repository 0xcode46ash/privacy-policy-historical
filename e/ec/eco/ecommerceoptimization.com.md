### [Privacy](http://www.ecommerceoptimization.com/privacy/ "Permanent Link: Privacy") \- eCommerce Optimization

eCommerce Optimization makes every effort to protect our readers privacy. We collect limited personal information so that we can better serve you, and that personal information will never be shared with any third party without your explicit permission. We do not sell our readers information, nor do we share it with any third parties without their explicit permission, or if we are required to by a law enforcement agency that has the appropriate legal jurisdiction.

eCommerce Optimization only collects your personal information during specific transactions:

**Logging in**  
When you log in to post comments, we will ask for your name, email address and optionally your Website location. We ask for your email address so that we can verify your email address, so other people cannot register for you. We do this to protect you and your email account.

**Purchasing services**  
If you purchase services from us, we will ask for the minimum information necessary to verify that you are authorized to make the purchase, that you are who you say, and not someone else with your credit card. We will ask for your address, your credit card information, including the expiration date to make sure that the card owner is the one who is using it. If you notice any charges from our site that you did not authorize, please contact your bank first, and then contact us so we can resolve any issues.

**Polls or surveys**  
We may, from time to time, have site polls or surveys in which we will ask for certain demographic information, along with your opinions of our site. Any information we request for these polls is strictly for internal purposes, to help us understand our readers. We may share cumulative data with our partners (average age of our users, etc.), but we will never share with our partners your name, your personal information, or your contact information. This demographic data will be entirely anonymous, and only for statistical purposes. If you receive any email correspondence claiming to be from eCommerce Optimization that includes requests for your personal information or that asks you to log into any URL that does NOT begin with eCommerceoptimization.com, please report it to us immediately.

**Cookies**  
Most site on the Internet use cookies. We use cookies so that you dont have to keep logging in every time you click through to a new article or page. Cookies also allow us to remember you if you come back to our site before the cookie expires.

**Readers or users**  
eCommerce Optimization allows you to post your email address publicly on our site so that other users who share your interests may contact you, but it is not required. There are many other people using our site, and if you post your email address or other information, one of them may try to contact you. We cannot be held responsible for the content or means of this communication, and we recommend that you only share information that you would normally share in an Online community with thousands of other people.

**Links**  
At times, we may have links on our site to our partners, or readers may post URLs to their own sites. We attempt to closely watch over and guard your personal information, but we cannot be held responsible for these sites and their individual business practices. If we discover that one of these sites is behaving fraudulently or is neglecting the privacy of its users, we will remove the links to that site as soon as possible. We are not responsible for broken links or links on other third party sites which are out of our control, but if you report them we will attempt a fix.

**Contact**  
If you have questions, comments or feedback regarding the Terms outlined on this page, you can [use our contact form](http://www.ecommerceoptimization.com/contact/ "use our contact form") to get in touch. We typically respond to emails or submitted comments within 24 hours, but it may take a little longer depending on the specific circumstances.
