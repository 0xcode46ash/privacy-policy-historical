Cookies

The IBE web site uses Cookies. Cookies are nothing more than a simple text file. They are not executable programmes and, consequently it is impossible for a Cookie to contain a virus, or any other application. Cookies are also very small, and you run no risk of filling your hard drive with too many cookies.

The IBE  Cookie that is placed on your computer contains only your unique reference number. There is no information in the Cookie that can identify you. The Cookie is only valid when you access the relevant IBE website.  
  
  
E-mail Addresses  
---  
  
This site recognises the home servers of visitors, but not their e-mail addresses. Individually identifiable e-mail addresses are not captured or stored unless they are provided. Persons who communicate with IBE, and supply us with an e-mail address may receive future communications by e-mail or telephone.

Persons who do not wish to receive e-mail messages may contact the IBE team and ask to be removed; to do so, send an e-mail to the IBE team and specify your name, company name and e-mail address. As such, IBE  supports the customer’s right to opt out. Persons who request information about IBE  and who supply us with their name and address will be added to our database to receive the requested information.
