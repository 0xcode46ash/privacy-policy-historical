ECT News Network Privacy Policy  
Updated September 1, 2006

Overview  
This privacy statement discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how to modify or correct it. The policies set forth below are applicable to the online media properties and electronic newsletters (collectively referred to herein as "the Service") which are owned and operated by [ECT News Network, Inc.](http://www.ectnews.com/)

Privacy Mission  
ECT News Network, Inc. is a privacy conscious organization and we are strongly committed to your right to privacy. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. 

Data Collection  
ECT News Network collects personally identifying information from users during registration, and in certain areas of the Service where visitors provide information together with content submissions, postings to online community discussion boards, suggestions, surveys, voting and opinion polling. ECT News Network uses this information for its internal objectives, including but not limited to editorial and feedback purposes. In the event the Service might consider publicly posting any such information, users are notified in advance of this possibility. 

Information submitted at the time of registration or content submission may also be used for marketing and promotional purposes by the Service and may be shared with companies that have been approved by ECT News Network. If a visitor objects to such use for any reason, he/she may discontinue that use -- either by [e-mail request](https://web.archive.org/perl/contact_form.pl?to=contact) or by modifying his/her registration information [online](http://www.ectnews.com/perl/User.pl). 

Cookies and Log Files  
A cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive that may contain information about you and your use of the Service. Log files are small text files that Web sites automatically create when you visit a site. ECT News Network utilizes cookies and log files to identify you and your access privileges when using the Service. We also use cookies and log files to enhance and track usage, and better understand how the Service is used. 

Users of the Service may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. These cookies are sent from third-party computers and are subject to such third parties' policies. By using the Service, you expressly agree that the ECT News Network bears no liability whatsoever, for real or perceived privacy invasion, or usage tracking technologies used by third-party ad services which are utilized by various advertisers. You agree that ECT News Network has no control over content served by third-party ad services, and that any remedies must be sought solely against those services. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. The "Help" section of the toolbar on most browsers will describe how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. However, if you do not accept cookies from a domain owned by ECT News Network, it is possible that the Service will not function properly for you at all times. 

Tracking  
We monitor how our users use the Service, including search terms entered, pages visited and documents viewed. This information is stored with each registered user's registration information. It is unique-number identifiable, and is used for purposes of enabling us to provide you with a personalized user experience. Aggregated forms of this data may also be used in order to help us understand areas for future research and to identify future features and functions to develop for the Service. This data may also be used by the Service to identify appropriate product offerings and subscription plans. 

Registration  
In order to use some features of the Service and to participate in interactive sessions, you will be asked to complete a registration form. During registration, you may be required to provide contact information, for yourself and the company you represent -- as well as business information about the company you represent. ECT News Network may use this contact information as a means of confirmation of your identity, position, or relationship to a particular enterprise or company. By using the Service, you agree to reveal only information that you are authorized to disclose and know to be true. During interactive sessions, we may also collect your opinions and preferences regarding certain products or services. We use this information to provide you with quality services as well as with offers that we think are relevant to you based on the preferences you share at registration or during interactive sessions. Please see the Information Sharing and Disclosure section below. 

Using your contact information, the Service and its partners may also send you e-mail messages under the following circumstances, among others: 

  * To respond to an inquiry or request for information;
  * To thank you for contacting the Service;
  * To welcome you to the Service and to its products and services;
  * To explain new product offerings and features of our services;
  * To notify you of special promotions; and
  * To communicate with you regarding customer service related issues.



Your contact information may be made available or provided to third-party service providers and contractors that are contractually obligated to protect your information as disclosed in this Privacy Policy. In order to maintain accurate records concerning communications that the Service may have received from or sent to you, ECT News Network may also indefinitely store any information that you provide to us by using the Service. 

Information Sharing and Disclosure  
Once you register with the Service, you are providing ECT News Network with personally identifiable information. ECT News Network may share certain aggregated demographic information with our sponsors regarding the users of the Service and responses we receive from you via interactive sessions. The aggregated information that we provide does not contain any personally identifiable information. 

If you have accessed the Service via the Web site of one of our partners or sponsors, then we may disclose all the information collected about you to such partner or sponsor. The provider's use of this information is governed by the provider's privacy policy and may be used for follow-up by telephone, e-mail, or other common methods. You should contact these providers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information. 

Special Offers  
We do not provide copies of our e-mail subscriber database information to third parties. As a registered user, and based upon the preferences you chose at registration, you will occasionally receive information on products, services, special offers and newsletters. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option to not receive these types of communications. As part of our services, we may contact you with offers, promotions and information on interactive sessions sponsored by identified third parties. All of the content related to such correspondence is provided by our sponsors, and ECT News Network disclaims any liability for such content. By virtue of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in promotions. ECT News Network will notify the third parties of the Privacy Policy that governs your information. However, ECT News Network has no control over the third-party sponsors' use of this information. ECT News Network will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if third-party sponsors will obtain such information. 

Links to Other Web Sites  
ECT News Network provides links to other Web sites for your convenience and information. ECT News Network is not responsible for the privacy procedures of these other sites. The entities that operate these sites are responsible for the content of their sites, any products or services they may offer through their sites, or any other use of their sites. Other Web sites may have their own privacy notices in place, which we recommend you review if you visit them as a result of your use of the Service. 

Security  
ECT News Network maintains administrative, technical and physical safeguards to defend against unauthorized disclosure, use, alteration or destruction of the personal information in our possession. Our security procedures include industry-standard technology and equipment to help protect your information, and we allow only the appropriate personnel and contractors access to your information. However, no system can guarantee complete security, and ECT News Network disclaims any liability resulting from use of the Service. 

Exceptions  
Other than as set forth above, ECT News Network will not otherwise use or disclose any of your personal information except to the extent reasonably necessary to: 

  * Process your information and to correct technical problems and malfunctions related to the Service or the computer systems supporting the Service;
  * Protect the security and integrity of the Service;
  * Protect the rights and property of ECT News Network and others;
  * Take precautions against liability;
  * Respond to claims that your information violates the rights and interests of third-parties;
  * Respond to judicial or administrative process or otherwise comply with applicable law; and
  * To assist law enforcement agencies in connection with investigations or matters related to public safety, as permitted by law.



International Usage  
While we make considerable effort to honor the laws and wishes of all users, the Service is available exclusively for users located in the United States of America and therefore may not recognize foreign laws. If you are located outside of the United States, please note that the information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using the Service, you consent to this transfer. 

Privacy of Children  
ECT News Network and the Services it provides are not directed to children under the age of 13. The Service operates in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and we do not knowingly accept registration by, and will not intentionally collect or use personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13 years of age. This policy is made clear during the registration process. In the event that we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database.
