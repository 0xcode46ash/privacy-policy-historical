ECNext Is Committed to Protecting Your Privacy

you provide us.

We will not sell, trade, or in any other way make your personal information available to third parties other than the publishers whose information you purchase at the ECNext Knowledge Centers. The information we collect from you during the registration process is used for internal sales tracking and reporting and for customer support purposes. You may receive e-mail from us or a publisher only if the opt-in is set in your account. Furthermore, any e-mails that you receive will provide a process for you to have your name removed. 

The collection of personal contact information and credit card information is an essential part of the registration process. ECNext recognizes the critical need to protect this information from unauthorized access. Therefore, we have made available a secure page for entering sensitive  
information, protected by industry-standard SSL encryption technology. This technology encrypts your information prior to transmitting it over the Internet, thus maximizing the security of the transmission. For those users who cannot access a secure page or are still uncomfortable sending sensitive information via the Internet, we provide a non-secure page for entering the information and a method to complete the registration process via telephone or fax.

Once your confidential information is received, it is maintained in our secure database. Except for those data elements that are necessary for authorizing credit card purchases, your confidential information is not retransmitted. Data elements needed to authorize credit card purchases are  
transmitted via our secure SSL-encrypted link to Cybercash.

If you have further questions or concerns that have not been addressed in this statement, please call ECNext Customer Service at (614) 932-6355, or [e-mail us](mailto:help@ecnext.com) with your name and day-time phone number so we can contact you.
