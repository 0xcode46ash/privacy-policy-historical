# Adobe EchoSign privacy | Adobe - Privacy Policy

Effective: March 28, 2013

The [Adobe Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy/policy.html) describes the general privacy practices of most of [Adobe’s websites and applications](https://web.archive.org/privacy/policy.html#cover), including Adobe® EchoSign®. More privacy-related information for Adobe EchoSign is provided below.

Adobe EchoSign is a [hosted service](https://web.archive.org/privacy/hosted-services.html) that Adobe offers to companies. When a company that uses Adobe EchoSign (the “sender”) sends a document to the “signer,” the signer may be required to provide personal information about him or herself in order to [electronically sign the document](https://www.echosign.adobe.com/en/how-it-works/features-benefits/signing-features.html). We also collect information about the sender’s and signer’s [use of Adobe EchoSign](https://web.archive.org/privacy/policy.html#info-collect) when they exchange and electronically sign a document, in order to record information about the signing process. This includes information such as the date and time of the event, and the IP address and other information about the browser or device used to send, sign, delegate, approve, or take other actions with respect to the document. If you agree when installing or using the EchoSign app or online service, we may also collect and record your location (as determined by your app or browser) when you take important actions such as sending, signing, approving, or delegating a document. If you later want to opt-out of future collection of location information, please refer to the privacy or location settings on your browser or device. All of this information is recorded as part of the "audit trail" that is linked to the electronically signed document. The audit trail is generally made available to senders, signers, and other “participants” to a document and is retained according to the agreement between Adobe and the sender.

If the sender requests that the signer’s identity be verified through our identity verification process, then additional information will be collected from the signer. As part of this process, information such as the signer’s government-issued identification number (or part of the number) and answers to challenge questions may be collected. Adobe does not store the identification number or the answers to the challenge questions. That information is used only to verify the signer’s identity through a company that provides the identity verification service on Adobe’s behalf.

In addition, the sender may request that the signer upload or attach copies of documents for a variety of purposes. For example, a sender may request that a signer upload documents that help the sender itself (not Adobe) verify the identity of the signer. With this feature, the sender will receive copies of the documents provided by the signer, and these will be stored along with the electronically signed copy of the document.

By default, Adobe EchoSign sends a copy of the electronically signed document to both the sender and the signer (although the sender can change this setting). The sender also controls how long documents are stored on Adobe EchoSign. The sender is responsible for configuring any security options available within Adobe EchoSign to protect the documents and their exchange between the sender and signer.

Adobe EchoSign integrates with several other websites, including social networking websites such as LinkedIn and Facebook. These features allow senders and signers to log into Adobe EchoSign using their accounts from the other websites. Also, senders may choose to link their Adobe EchoSign accounts with another online document service or sales automation service that the sender may use, such as Salesforce.com. In those cases, note that some personal information of the sender and signer, as well as any documents signed or identity documents provided by the signer, may be stored in these other services (as well as on Adobe EchoSign). The Adobe Privacy Policy does not apply to information or documents processed or stored on non-Adobe systems.
