# Privacy and Cookies Policy - England and Wales Cricket Board | England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) - The Official Website of the ECB

### ABOUT US

ecb.co.uk is operated by the England and Wales Cricket Board Limited ( **ECB** ), the governing body for cricket in England and Wales. The ECB is the data controller in respect of all personal data collected on this website which means that we are responsible for ensuring that we do so in full compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and all other related privacy laws.

This privacy policy explains what information we collect about you, how we use it, and the steps we take to ensure that it is kept secure. We also explain your rights and how to contact us.

Please note this website may contain links to other websites which are provided for your convenience. We are only responsible for the privacy practices and security of this site. We recommend that you check the privacy and security policies and procedures of each and every other website that you visit.

BY USING THIS WEBSITE AND GIVING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US, YOU INDICATE THAT YOU CONSENT TO US AND [ECB PARTNERS](http://www.ecb.co.uk/ecb/partners/) COLLECTING AND USING THIS PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS SET OUT IN THIS POLICY

### CHILDREN

If you are under 16, you will need the permission of your parent or guardian before registering on our website(s) and we will require your parent or guardian to confirm that they have given permission. We may ask for their contact details so that we can check that they have done so and may carry out checks to confirm that the details you have given us are correct.

We normally only send newsletters and offers and opportunities to children where their parent or guardian has given consent to them being sent. Your parent or guardian can change their mind at any time (see ‘Newsletters, Offers and Opportunities’ below).

### THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

In order to provide you with the services you require, the ECB will collect personal information about you from our website, telephone conversations, emails and written and verbal communications. These will include, for example, your name, address, email address, phone number and details that are relevant to the service(s) in which you are interested. Occasionally we may ask for date of birth, for example, where the service you require has age related restrictions.

We may supplement the information that you provide with other information that we obtain from our dealings with you or which we receive from other organisations, such as County Cricket Boards, Cricket clubs, other cricketing organisations and [ECB Partners](http://www.ecb.co.uk/ecb/partners/).

#### Information about other people

If you provide information to us about any person other than yourself, you must ensure that they understand how their information will be used and that you are authorised to disclose it to us, and to consent to its use on their behalf, before doing so.

#### IP addresses

In order to understand how users use our website and services, we may collect IP addresses.

### Cookies

In common with many other website operators, we may use standard technology called 'cookies' on this site. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive and they are used to record how you navigate this website on each visit.

Our cookies are used to enable us to develop our website to reflect our customers interests and by noting who has seen which pages, properties and advertisements (including click throughs from emails), how frequently particular pages are visited and to enable us to determine the most popular areas of our website. We may use cookies to enrich your experience of using the website by allowing us to tailor what you see to what we have learned about your preferences during your visits to the site. Sometimes we use third parties services such as Google Analytics and Sitestat and they may use cookies on our behalf in order to provide their services.

You may get cookies (including Flash cookies) from our sponsors and advertisers if you click on their links or adverts. You should check their privacy and security policies to understand how they use these.

### HOW WE WILL USE YOUR INFORMATION

All personal information that we obtain about you and/or any other person whose details you provide will be recorded, used, and protected by us in accordance with current data protection legislation, our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.ecb.co.uk/information/terms-and-conditions) and this Privacy Policy.

#### Disclosing your personal information

In order to provide our products and services, we may, occasionally, appoint other organisations to carry out some of the processing activities on our behalf.

### MONITORING

We may monitor or record telephone calls for security purposes and to improve the quality of the services we provide to you.

### USE OF YOUR INFORMATION OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION

Some of the organisations to which we may disclose personal information may be situated outside of the European Union. In order to provide the products and services you or others whose information you have provided to us, we may need to transfer your/their personal information to these countries some of which do not have laws that protect privacy rights as extensively as in the United Kingdom. If we do transfer your personal information to other territories, we will take proper steps to ensure that the information is protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

Privacy laws and practice are constantly developing and we aim to meet high standards. Our policies and procedures are, therefore, under continual review. We may, from time to time, update our security and privacy policies and suggest that you check this page periodically to review our latest policy.

### UPDATING AND CORRECTING INFORMATION

You may update or correct your personal information online in relevant membership areas or by contacting us in writing or by email (see the section "How to contact us" below). Please include your name, address and/or email address when you contact us as this helps us to ensure that we accept amendments only from the correct person. We encourage you to promptly update your personal information if it changes. If you are providing updates or corrections about another person, we may require you to provide us with proof that you are authorised to provide that information to us.

### YOUR RIGHTS TO ACCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

You have the right to receive a copy of the personal information that we hold about you. The same right applies to any other person whose personal information you provide to us. We may charge a small fee towards the cost of administering any request made. The current fee is £10.00.
