This privacy policy explains what information we collect about you, how we use it, and the steps we take to ensure that it is kept secure. We also explain your rights and how to contact us.

Please note this website may contain links to other websites which are provided for your convenience. We are only responsible for the privacy practices and security of this site. We recommend that you check the privacy and security policies and procedures of each and every other website that you visit.

**Children**

If you are under 16, you will need the permission of your parent or guardian before registering on our website(s) and we will require your parent or guardian to confirm that they have given permission. We may ask for their contact details so that we can check that they have done so and may carry out checks to confirm that the details you have given us are correct.

We normally only send newsletters and offers and opportunities to children where their parent or guardian has given consent to them being sent. Your parent or guardian can change their mind at any time (see ‘Newsletters, Offers and Opportunities’ below).

Occasionally we may ask for date of birth, for example, where the service you require has age related restrictions.

We may supplement the information that you provide with other information that we obtain from our dealings with you or which we receive from other organisations, such as County Cricket Boards, Cricket clubs, other cricketing organisations and ECB Partners.

**ECB Partner Programme**

The ECB has teamed up with a selection of carefully chosen [sponsors and commercial partners](https://www.ecb.co.uk/sponsors-and-partners).

**Newsletters, offers, opportunities**

We and the ECB Partners would like to contact you and/or any person whose information you provide to us to provide newsletters and to tell you and/or them about offers and opportunities (such as match ticketing, discounts, competitions, events and hospitality) that are available and about a range of other initiatives in a number of ways, including by post, telephone, text/picture/video message or by email. Details of how to opt-in to or opt-out of receiving details of offers are on relevant pages of this website.

**Monitoring**

We may monitor or record telephone calls for security purposes and to improve the quality of the services we provide to you.

**Use of information outside of EU**

Some of the organisations to which we may disclose personal information may be situated outside of the European Union. In order to provide the products and services you or others whose information you have provided to us, we may need to transfer your/their personal information to these countries some of which do not have laws that protect privacy rights as extensively as in the United Kingdom. If we do transfer your personal information to other territories, we will take proper steps to ensure that the information is protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Changes to this privacy policy**

Privacy laws and practice are constantly developing and we aim to meet high standards. Our policies and procedures are, therefore, under continual review. We may, from time to time, update our security and privacy policies and suggest that you check this page periodically to review our latest policy.

**Updating and correcting information**

You may update or correct your personal information online in relevant membership areas or by contacting us in writing or by email (see the section "How to contact us" below). Please include your name, address and/or email address when you contact us as this helps us to ensure that we accept amendments only from the correct person. We encourage you to promptly update your personal information if it changes. If you are providing updates or corrections about another person, we may require you to provide us with proof that you are authorised to provide that information to us.

**Your rights to access**

You have the right to receive a copy of the personal information that we hold about you. The same right applies to any other person whose personal information you provide to us. We may charge a small fee towards the cost of administering any request made. The current fee is £10.00.
