**2. ** _PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT_** **** **  
  
_In General_. We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our website or provide to us in some other manner. Personal information is data that identifies you, or that can be combined with other information to identify or contact you, and includes (but is not limited to) your name, business or personal email address, job title, organization, organization’s physical address, direct telephone number, photograph, and biographical details. You are not obligated to provide us with any personal information, although you may need to provide some information to register as a member, submit a question, or engage in other transactions on our Site. We strive to limit the type of personal information that we collect to information that helps us accomplish our goal of providing first-class services for the benefit of our existing and prospective Members.

_Members_.  If you are a CEB Member and access the restricted, Members-only areas of our Sites, CEB may collect additional information relating to your participation in CEB Programs. We also may obtain information about your access and use of CEB research materials, decision-support tools, and other online and offline offerings.

_Information from other sources_.  We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from other sources. Examples of information we may receive includes updated contact information and additional demographic information. Please note that CEB may have previously collected personal information relating to you at the time you or your organization enrolled in a CEB Program or Programs, as well as in the course of allocating and issuing to you your unique ID and password to access the Members-only areas of our Sites.

We also may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer and measure the overall effectiveness of our online content, advertising campaigns, and the products and services we offer through the site. 



_Information Collected by Third Parties_.  Third parties, such as vendors, advertising entities, and business partners, may use cookies and other technologies (such as Web beacons) to collect information about your online activities. The purposes for collecting this information includes: to measure usage of our site; to analyze, modify, and personalize advertising content on our Sites; and to provide ads about goods and services we hope will be of interest to you. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features these third parties may use, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Some of these third parties may be third-party network advertisers that offer you the option of not having this information collected.   
  
  
**3. ** _HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT_** **  
_In General_.  CEB uses the information we collect about you for the following purposes: 

  * to respond to inquiries that you submit to us about CEB membership via the online "contact us" feature and determine which Programs and services will help you achieve your business goals;
  * to send you membership details and information about CEB Programs and services that you have requested from us;
  * to administer your membership and facilitate your access to and provide you with CEB resources, decision-support tools, and other materials available to you through your Program subscription;
  * to communicate with you about surveys, marketing, promotions, executive-oriented events, educational forums, and other exclusive opportunities offered by CEB, including information about other CEB Programs in which you may be interested;

  * to enhance the CEB network and CEB products and services; and
  * to ensure the technical functioning of the Sites.



_EPNConnect_ _.   _Through EPNConnect –– the online component of CEB’s Executive Productivity Network –– Members can tap into our membership directory and locate senior executives best able to help them deal with specific questions and challenges. To participate in EPNConnect, Members are asked to create an online experience profile, which includes information about their job and title, and then enables other senior executives participating in EPNConnect to determine whether the Member’s background and expertise might make them a useful contact on a particular issue. Based on this determination, one Member might use another Member’s information to contact that Member to obtain the benefit of their expertise.   
  
**4. ** _CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR INFORMATION_** ** __****  
  
CEB believes that it is important that individuals are given the opportunity to exercise choice with respect to how their personal information is collected and used. If we propose to use your personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy or any service-specific privacy notices, we will allow you a convenient way to opt-out of such further uses.

__Marketing Communications__ :  We hope you find value in the communications we provide, and we will respect your wishes not to receive marketing communications. Please note that we will continue to send you member services emails and other service-related communications regardless of any such request. These service-related communications are an integral part of the CEB Programs to which you subscribe. Rest assured that CEB will not share your information and personal details with other non-agent third parties for promotional or marketing purposes, without giving you a choice about such sharing. 

__Other Choices__ :  You can, if you wish, contact CEB and request access to your personal information, as described more fully below under "Access and Correction of Personal Information." We also will strive to comply with your wishes with respect to the handling of your personal information in all other cases, provided that this does not interfere with our provision of services to you or our legal or regulatory obligations. And, you are free to decline to provide personal information to us, although this may mean that you are unable to enroll in CEB Programs or continue to use our services.   
  
**5. ** _DISCLOSURES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION_****  
CEB may share your personal information with other companies or individuals in the following instances: 

  * When we engage service providers and third-party agents to process personal information on our behalf. When we do so, CEB requires that these service providers implement adequate technological and organizational security measures before they can receive any personal information from us.
  * For legitimate business purposes connected with the provision of CEB goods, services, and benefits for executive customers. Where information is shared with a third party for a legitimate business purpose, CEB will seek reasonable assurances from that third party that the personal information will be processed for legitimate reasons and appropriately protected.
  * In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
  * When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of CEB, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements.
  * In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.



Please note that, when you become a CEB Member, we may make information about you (including contact and institutional information) available to other Members through EPNConnect and other online and offline services. We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers, investors, and partners. This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest. 

Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.  
  
**6. ** _INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION_****  
  
CEB operates the Sites in the United States and, depending on your country of residence, the submission of personal information to our Sites may involve some transfer of personal information to the United States. In addition, we may transfer personal information to our affiliate company in India and/or the United Kingdom and/or Australia for certain processing operations. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States, India, Australia, and the United Kingdom may not provide protections equivalent to those of your country of residence. CEB has taken steps to ensure that appropriate levels of protection necessary to maintain the security and quality of your personal information are in place and that any transferred data is processed only in accordance with this Policy.

CEB Members also should be aware that, by participating in our online and offline peer networks and services, such as EPNConnect (described above), and Annual Executive Retreats and other conferences, information about them may be made available to other CEB Members throughout the world to facilitate intelligence-sharing across our membership. If you are uncomfortable with this transfer of your information, you should not use those services. Please refer to any more-detailed privacy notices governing such services for additional information about how they may affect your privacy.  
  
  
**7. ** _INFORMATION INTEGRITY_****  
  
CEB processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any service-specific privacy notices. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current. Where CEB receives any personal information directly from our Members, we rely upon our Members to provide us with information that is accurate and correct, and to inform us when the information becomes incorrect or out-of-date.  
  
  
**8. ** _ACCESS AND CORRECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION_****  
  
You can request access to any personal information that we hold about you and ask us to correct any personal information which may be inaccurate, except where the law requires otherwise. To access, correct or raise inquiries concerning your personal information in our possession, please contact:

Chief Compliance Officer, The Corporate Executive Board, 1919 North Lynn Street, Arlington, Virginia 22209; or email us at [ legaldept@executiveboard.com](mailto:legaldept@executiveboard.com). 

In some cases, CEB Members can directly access their online profiles and other personal details, enabling them to amend, update or add information by themselves at any time by logging into the relevant Program webpage.  
  
  
**9. ** _INFORMATION SECURITY_ ****  
  
CEB has implemented technical and organizational security measures to help protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of personal information. We review our systems regularly to ensure that the security and integrity of personal information in our possession is not compromised. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be entirely secure, and CEB assumes no liability for any damage suffered by you caused by the interception, alteration, or misuse of information during transmission. 

Within CEB, we restrict access to personal information to employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our Programs and services. We subject our third-party agents to contractual controls to ensure that they apply suitable protections to any personal information they access or receive from us.

Please note that the effective security with respect to our Sites depends, in part, on our Members ensuring that any IDs and passwords that they have been issued by us are kept confidential and secure and that Members adhere to the restrictions on password and ID-sharing set forth in our Terms of Use.  

  
  
**10. ** _OTHER WEBSITES_****  
  
To provide increased value to users of our Sites, we may provide links to other websites or resources that are not part of the CEB network of Programs. CEB does not exercise control over these websites or their privacy practices.  
  
  
**11. ** _CHILDREN_****  
  
Our Sites contain business-related content and are specifically aimed at and designed for use by adults. CEB does not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about individuals under the age of 18 years. If we discover that we have received personal information from an individual whom we believe to be under the age of 18, we will delete such information from our systems.  
  
  
**12. ** _CHANGES TO THIS POLICY_****  
  
This Policy may change from time to time. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will post any Policy changes on this page. If we feel it appropriate, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification). Your continued use of our Sites following such posts or notices will signal your acceptance of such changes.

  * If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Policy, please feel free to contact us at Chief Compliance Officer, The Corporate Executive Board, 1919 North Lynn Street, Arlington, Virginia 22209; or email us at [ legaldept@executiveboard.com](mailto:legaldept@executiveboard.com).
