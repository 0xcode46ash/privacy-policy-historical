# Privacy Policy

Financial Times takes the privacy of our users seriously. This policy explains our data processing practices in relation to the Financial Times Career Management sites only, which are exec-appointments.com, jobs.ft.com and non-execs.com, collectively the FTCM Sites. This statement is supplemental to the general Financial Times Privacy Policy (FT Policy), which should also be referred to and is available here <http://www.ft.com/servicestools/help/privacy>.

The Data Controller of the FTCM Sites is The Financial Times Limited (FT or Us). Please refer to the FT Policy.

Information Collected

We collect personal information about you (Data) when you register with, or create a profile on one of the FTCM sites, so that we can provide you with services that they offer. We may also collect information automatically about your use of FTCM Sites through cookies and other devices. Please refer to the FT Cookie Policy for more details.

The Data we collect may include: name, address, country of residence, email address, telephone number(s), nationality, details of your education and working career, salary expectations, eligibility to work in certain countries, personal interests, details of how you use the jobs websites (including the criteria which you use to set up your job searches, email alerts) and any additional details you provide when applying for a job.

Use and Disclosure of Your Data

The use and disclosure of your Data will depend on the FTCM Sites’ services that you use.

Job Application Service

In order to apply for jobs, receive job alert emails or to save job searches or shortlists, you will be required to register or become a member. The Data you provide at registration, as well as the saved job searches and job alert emails you create, may be used to provide you with information about other relevant jobs and services, and by FT for aggregated statistical analysis.

When you apply for jobs through the FTCM Sites, you will be required to provide relevant Data, your CV and an optional covering letter or message (Job Application). Your Job Application is forwarded directly to the advertiser of the job that you are applying for (Recruiters), and will also be held on our systems for as long as reasonably necessary i.e. in the event that a submission has failed and it needs to be resent to the Recruiter. Recruiters may include agencies who may pass your information to companies that are recruiting in employment field(s) relevant to your interests. We ask all Recruiters to use the information you provide only for the purposes of recruitment, to hold the information securely and for no longer than reasonably necessary. However, we are not able to control the use and storage of your information by Recruiters.

If the Recruiter of any jobs you apply for is based outside EEA this will involve a transfer of your Data outside EEA. You should not apply to these advertisements unless you consent to this transfer. Applications that are made through Recruiters’ or other external websites will be processed by those 3rd parties, and therefore your information will be subject to their privacy policies.

Executive Profile and Match Service

The exec-appointments.com, jobs.ft.com and non-execs.com sites provide the option for you to create a personal Executive Profile, and to control access to it through various settings. Profile information includes anything that you provide in the relevant information fields, which varies depending on which FTCM site you use.

The exec-appointments.com, jobs.ft.com and non-execs.com sites offer a Match Service which allows authorised Recruiters to search its Profile Database for profile information that meets their search criteria. Whether your profile is included in the searchable Profile Database will depend on your chosen settings.

exec-appointments.com and jobs.ft.com

If you choose to make your profile Public, the public description you provide will be fully visible on the web and authorised Recruiters will also be able to access and download your profile information and full contact details through the Match Service. If you choose to keep your profile accessible on a Case-by-Case basis, only your public description will be viewable on the web and you will be asked to grant permission to release your profile and contact details to authorised Recruiters on a case-by-case basis.

If you choose to keep your profile in Draft, it will not be visible to Recruiters or matched in search results.

non-execs.com

When you become a member of the Financial Times Non Executives Directors’ Club, you will be able to create an Executive Profile to appear in the Member Directory. If you decide to make your CV and profile information Public in the Member Directory this will allow Authorised Recruiters and other Club Members to access your profile information.

We request Recruiters not to hold your information for longer than necessary and not to use your information for purposes other than recruitment. However we are not able to control the storage of your CV or profile information by Recruiters.

Control of Your Data

If you wish to change your privacy settings you can do so at any time by visiting "My Account" on exec-appointments.com or "Your Executive Profile" on non-execs.com.

If you choose to delete your profile details and/ or CV we will not retain a copy of it on our database. However your basic details (name, email, password and citizenship), along with your log-in access, will be retained should you wish to create another profile in the future. If you wish to de-register your account with us, please contact info@exec-appointments.com.
