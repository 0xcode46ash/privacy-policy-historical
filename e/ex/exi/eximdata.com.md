Exim Infotek (India) Pvt. Ltd. is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings. The policy may change from time to time so please check periodically.

**1\. Personal Information**

During registration, EximData asks for your name and email address. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to EximData and you are able to take full advantage of EximData’s offerings.

**2\. Use of Personal Information**

EximData’s primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. This includes personalization services, interactive communications and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, EximData is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.

**3\. Collection of information by EximData**

When you are on a EximData site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with EximData alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than EximData, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer.

Promotions that run on EximData may be sponsored by companies other than EximData or may be co-sponsored by EximData and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don’t want your data to be shared.

Please be aware that EximData advertisers or websites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. This privacy statement does not cover the information practices of those web sites linked to EximData.

**4\. Sharing of Information**

As a general rule, EximData will not disclose or share any of your personally identifiable information except when EximData has your permission or under special circumstances, such as when EximData believes in good faith that the law requires it or as permitted in terms of this policy.

From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you opt in to receive information from these third parties, EximData will, with your permission, share your name and email address with them.

EximData may also disclose account information in special cases when EximData has reasons to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating EximData Terms of Services or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) EximData’s rights or property, other EximData users, or if EximData deems it necessary to maintain, service, and improve its products and services.

**5\. Distribution of Information**

EximData may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services. In addition, if you indicate upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from EximData and its partners, EximData may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that it feels may be of interest to you. Only EximData or agents working on behalf of EximData and under confidentiality agreements, will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicate that you do not object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailing, simply tell EximData when you give your personal information or, at any time you can easily edit your EximData Account information to no longer receive such offers and mailings.

**6\. Updation of personal information**

You may edit your EximData Account Information and your EximData profile by sending a request to support@eximdata.com

Your EximData account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will result in not being able to access any members-only area of the EximData network, including your EximData Mail account (if you have one). Residual information will remain within our archive records.

Please remember to sign out of your EximData account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place. Whenever EximData handles personal information as described above regardless of where this occurs, EximData takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant Terms of Services and this Privacy Policy.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while EximData strives to protect your personal information, EximData cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to EximData and you do so at your own risk. Once EximData receives your transmission, it makes best efforts to ensure its security on its systems. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
