**General Privacy**   
ExchangeRate.com, Inc. respects your privacy and seeks to protect your personal data. Please read on to learn how we obtain, use and protect any personal data. 

**Information ExchangeRate.com, Inc. collects and why.**   
ExchangeRate.com, Inc. collects information about our web site visitors. The first bit of data that we collect is a registration cookie.

The cookie we serve upon entry to the site is used to determine whether the visitor has registered with ExchangeRate.com. Registration stops the pop up registration window from coming up when the visitor returns to the site at a later date. 

The email addresses supplied by registered visitors that have agreed to receive email from ExchangeRate.com are kept by ExchangeRate.com. The email addresses may be used by Exchangerate.com to promote products and services of partners and sponsors of ExchangeRate.com. 

In addition, a log of all users visiting ExchangeRate.com is kept. This is for security reasons. ExchangeRate.com, Inc. often runs specialized programs to analyze these logs for various reasons including port scanning attempts, hacking attempts, and other reasons related to the security of our web site. In the event that domestic or foreign visitors are suspected of illegal activites by ExchangeRate.com, Inc. we reserve the right and WILL turn over server logs and reports to local, state, and federal authorities.
