**Our Commitments to You**

It is the Excite UK Network's policy to allow our customers to provide as much - or as little - personal information to us as they feel comfortable doing. As a customer of the Excite UK Network you: 

  1. Control what personally identifiable information is collected  

  2. Control what the Excite UK Network can do with personally identifiable information   

  3. Have a guarantee of privacy 



The information provided in this Privacy Policy covers your interactions on the Excite UK Network of sites. 

As a standard practice, the Excite UK Network assigns a random number to each user for anonymously tracking content preferences and traffic patterns.   
This random number lets us keep track of "how many" times customers are doing specific things - like visiting our site each month - without really knowing who those customers are. This random number is kept in a file on your computer called a "cookie." Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the identity of any user: Unless you specifically tell us, the Excite UK Network will never know who you are. 

You may, however, elect to tell us things that you want the Excite UK Network to remember. We hope that, like many of our customers, you will want to provide information about yourself to the Excite UK Network because it will make our Web sites more valuable to you. If you are comfortable providing us with information about yourself, enhanced services are available to you that are impossible for us to offer to anonymous users. An example of this is our [Excite Mail](http://mail.excite.co.uk/) free email service. In this instance, we also retain information about you between computing sessions by using the cookie. 

The choice of how much personally identifiable information about yourself to disclose to the Excite UK Network is left completely up to you, our customer. But however you choose to interact with the Excite UK Network, you have our guarantee of privacy:

 **The Excite UK Network will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any party outside the Excite UK Network without first receiving that customer's permission.**
