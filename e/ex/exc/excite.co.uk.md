# Excite UK Channels : Info

Excite UK wants to make your experience online satisfying and safe. 

Our data collection policies allow you to choose how much information to provide to us and to control how we use that information. Our goal is to provide you with a robust experience while allowing you to control your privacy and giving you a means to voice any questions or concerns you may have. 

This statement discloses the privacy policy for the Excite UK Network of sites, which encompasses the site http://www.excite.co.uk, and all current and future co-branded versions of this site, which collectively form and are referred to as the Excite UK Network. This statement does not extend to sites that are linked to the Excite UK Network but which are not part of the Excite UK Network. 

The Excite UK Network recognises it has an important mission to build user trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of disclosure and informed consent. This privacy policy answers the following questions: 

  1. What information this network gathers/tracks about you
  2. What this network does with the information it gathers/tracks
  3. With whom this network shares the information it gathers/tracks
  4. What are this network's opt-in/opt-out features (How you will be asked to make conscious decisions as to whether you want the Excite UK Network to use your personal information in particular ways)
  5. What you can do to correct or update the personal information you have provided the Excite UK Network
  6. What you can do to "deactivate" yourself as an Excite UK Network user or remove personal information from the Excite UK network
  7. Where is the information you give us stored



Questions regarding this Privacy Policy should be directed to Excite's Support Services by using the feedback form available here. 

Privacy Philosophy 

Our Commitments to You 

It is the Excite UK Network's policy to allow our customers to provide as much - or as little - personal information to us as they feel comfortable doing. As a customer of the Excite UK Network you: 

1\. Control what personally identifiable information is collected  
2\. Control what the Excite UK Network can do with personally identifiable information  
3\. Have a guarantee of privacy 

The information provided in this Privacy Policy covers your interactions on the Excite UK Network of sites. 

As a standard practice, the Excite UK Network assigns a random number to each user for anonymously tracking content preferences and traffic patterns. This random number lets us keep track of "how many" times customers are doing specific things - like visiting our site each month - without really knowing who those customers are. This random number is kept in a file on your computer called a "cookie." Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the identity of any user: Unless you specifically tell us, the Excite UK Network will never know who you are. 

You may, however, elect to tell us things that you want the Excite UK Network to remember. We hope that, like many of our customers, you will want to provide information about yourself to the Excite UK Network because it will make our Web sites more valuable to you. If you are comfortable providing us with information about yourself, enhanced services are available to you that are impossible for us to offer to anonymous users. An example of this is our Excite Mail free email service. In this instance, we also retain information about you between computing sessions by using the cookie. 

The choice of how much personally identifiable information about yourself to disclose to the Excite UK Network is left completely up to you, our customer. But however you choose to interact with the Excite UK Network, you have our guarantee of privacy: 

The Excite UK Network will never wilfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any party outside the Excite UK Network without first receiving that customer's permission, unless the disclosure is required by law. 

Information Gathered

The Excite UK Network gathers information about our customers that allows us to offer compelling and easily accessible online content in a manner that provides personal privacy protection as well: 

1\. Occasionally we ask you to provide us personal information such as your name, email address, or what your interests and hobbies are. You never have to answer these questions although this may limit what services we can offer you. For instance, we will not be able to offer you personalised stock portfolios if you don't tell us what stocks you wish to track. 

2\. We catalogue traffic patterns throughout the sites. 

3\. We use a feature of your browser called a "cookie" to assign a "User ID." Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. Your Excite UK Network User ID automatically identifies your computer - but not you - to our servers when you visit our site. Unless you specifically tell us, the Excite UK Network will never know who you are, even though we assign your computer a cookie. 

4\. Other companies which help target ads to you and which place advertising on our site (such as DoubleClick) also have the ability to assign a different cookie to you in a process that the Excite UK Network does not control. But since cookies aren't useable for identifying individuals (you'll be just a number to them), these advertisers will never know who you are - and the Excite UK Network will never tell them! To find out more about the use of cookies and the information-gathering practices and opt-out procedures of DoubleClick, please go to <http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/>. 

Use of the Information

The Excite UK Network is trying to always provide you with a compelling reason to come back and visit our site again: 

1\. We use your personal information to provide personalised portions of our site that are intended to provide just the information you are interested in receiving. Some of these personalised services are made available directly by the Excite UK Network (your "My Excite Start Page" is a good example of such a personalised service). In other instances it is our partners who provide these tailored services from outside the Excite UK Network. 

2\. We analyse what our customers like and don't like about the Excite UK Network's current offerings so that we can design better services. 

3\. We use information about what you are searching for to help focus the advertisements we present to you, hopefully to make them more valuable to you. 

4\. We develop summary - not individual - reports for our advertisers. An example of a summary report might be "12,000 people clicked on Advertisement "X" today and of those people, 35% had previously indicated they had an interest in sports." The people that make it possible for you to use the Excite UK Network for free - our advertisers - need this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are. We never tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements unless you have specifically told us this is acceptable. 

5\. And occasionally we will send you email communications to provide information which we think you will find useful, including information about products and services from the Excite UK Network. It is our policy only to send email to customers who give us permission to do so. In every such email, we will also have instructions on how to unsubscribe so that you will not receive any future emails from the Excite UK Network if you do not wish to, or you can avoid receiving them altogether - see the "Opt-in/Opt-out Features " below. 

Information Distribution

The individually identifiable information that you provide will be used extensively within the Excite UK Network to provide a personalised experience to you. 

It will also be provided to Excite UK's partners that offer some of the personalised content on our site (see "Use of the Information" above for some examples). 

We might also give the information you provide to other third parties unrelated to offerings on the Excite UK Network, so that they might contact you. 

However, this information will only be shared if you have given your permission for this to occur. Our privacy guarantee to you remains unchanged: 

The Excite UK Network will never wilfully disclose individually identifiable information about any customer to any party outside the Excite UK Network without first receiving that customer's permission, unless the disclosure is required by law. 

Other companies that place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising or content. The Excite UK Network does not control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers or content providers directly if you have any questions about their use of this information. Additionally, the Excite UK Network does not control the information collection and distribution policies on sites outside the Excite UK Network, although we do encourage our co-branding partners to adopt privacy policies similar to this one. 

Opt-in/Opt-out Features

As an Excite UK Network registered user you have complete control over what communications you may receive and sign-up for. The Excite UK Network has a policy of asking you to make a conscious choice about what communications you would like to receive. We will not include you in any communications unless you tell us you would like to be included. Every time we collect your name and address information when you register with the Excite UK Network: 

1\. You must make a conscious choice as to whether or not you want to receive communication from the Excite UK Network such as email newsletters announcing contests or product features or information about Excite services. 

2\. You must make a conscious choice as to whether or not you want Excite to provide advertisers, partners and other third parties with your personal information. 

And of course, you can always decline to provide the personal information in the first place. 

The Excite UK Network does reserve the right to send infrequent service alert messages to its customers to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. An example would be notification of the impending closing of an account that is believed to be abandoned. This right does not allow us to contact you to suggest you try a new service if you have asked us not to do so and issuance of a service alert is extremely rare. On occasion, the Excite UK Network's partners who provide tailored services that require personal information in order to work (see "Use of the Information") will ask users to provide this personal information. The Excite UK Network cannot control the "Opt-in" or "Opt-out" policies of these companies; therefore, the Excite UK Network cannot control whether you become enrolled in our partner's services. 

Correcting and Updating

At all times a registered user of the Excite UK Network has total control over the accuracy of the personally identifiable information that the user provides to Excite UK. If you wish to correct or update the personal information you have provided to Excite, simply go to http://www.excite.UK/front/personalize/register/. Make sure you are 'Logged-in' before you go to this address. To check if you are logged in go to http://www.excite.co.uk and make sure you can see in Personalisation Manager the option to 'Logout' If you cannot see this click on 'Login'. 

If you have provided personal information to an Excite UK Network partner for the purposes of accessing tailored services from that partner, the Excite UK Network will not be able to correct or update your personal information supplied by you to our partner. In addition, the Excite UK Network cannot control the capabilities these companies have to correct or update your personal information. 

Deleting and Deactivating

At any time as a registered user of the Excite UK Network you can "Opt-out" of any communications that you may have initially agreed to be included in. To do this follow the procedure outlined in 'Correcting and Updating' and change your 'Opt-in' and 'Opt-out' preferences in your personal profile. Additionally any communication by e-mail includes information on how to be removed from email subscriber lists. This will effectively 'deactivate' you as a user and you will no longer receive any 'intrusive' communication. All Excite UK Network registered users can at any time remove personally identifiable information from their Excite UK Network user profile. This will not delete your 'profile' as a user (see information on "cookies" and "User ID" in "Information Gathered" above) but it will remove any personal information pertaining to this profile. To do this follow the procedure outlined in 'Correcting and Updating' and change your 'Opt-in' and 'Opt-out' preferences in your personal profile. Any information you do not wish the Excite UK Network to store in your profile can be deleted. Make sure you click the 'Change Profile' option so that changes are saved. Please be advised that doing this may affect some of the services that you use on the Excite UK Network. 

Storage of Data

We reserve the right to transfer, store and process all the data you provide us in the United States. By using Excite you agree to such transfer, storage and processing. However, this does not affect our Privacy Policy: 

The Excite UK Network will never wilfully disclose individually identifiable information about any customer to any party outside the Excite UK Network without first receiving that customer's Permission, unless the disclosure is required by law.
