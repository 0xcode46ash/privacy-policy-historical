# Excite's Customer Information Privacy Policy

|  |  | 

* * *

|  |  |  |   
---  
It is Excite's policy to allow our customers to provide as much - or as little - personal information to us as they feel comfortable doing. As a customer of Excite you: 

  1. Control what personally identifiable information is collected
  2. Control what Excite can do with the information
  3. Have a guarantee of privacy



The information provided in this Customer Information Privacy Policy covers your interactions on the Excite Network at excite.com, webcrawler.com, mckinley.com, and city.net. 

As a company, Excite believes so strongly in protecting consumer privacy that we aren't just a licensee of TRUSTe, we are one of only twelve companies - and the only online media company - to be a Premier Corporate Sponsor of TRUSTe's efforts.

As a standard practice, Excite assigns a random number to each user for anonymously tracking content preferences and traffic patterns.  This random number lets us keep track of "How many" times customers are doing specific things - like visiting our site each month - without really knowing who those customers are. This random number is kept in a file on your computer called a "cookie." Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the identity of any user: Unless you specifically tell us, Excite will never know who you are.

You may, however, elect to tell us things that you want Excite to remember. We hope that, like many of our customers, you will _want to_ provide information about yourself to Excite because it will make our Web site more valuable to you. If you are comfortable providing us with information about yourself, enhanced services are available to you that are impossible for us to offer to anonymous users. Examples of such enhanced services would be travel reservation services available through our award-winning [Excite Travel](http://city.net/forms/reservations/) service or our [MailExcite](http://mailexcite.com/) free email service.  In these instances, we retain information about you between computing sessions by using the cookie. 

The choice of how much personally identifiable information about yourself to disclose to Excite is left completely up to you, our customer. But however you choose to interact with Excite, you have our guarantee of privacy:  
  
**Excite will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer's permission.**  
  
---  
Excite gathers information about our customers that allows us to offer compelling and easily accessible online content in a manner that provides personal privacy protection as well:   
**°** | Occasionally we ask you to provide us information such as your name, email address, or what your interests and hobbies are. You never have to answer these questions although this may limit what services we can offer you. For instance, we will not be able to offer you a [personalized stock portfolio](http://quicken.excite.com/investments/portfolio/) if you don't tell us what stocks you wish to track.  
**°** | We catalog traffic patterns throughout the site.  
**°** | We use a feature of your browser called a "cookie" to assign a "User ID."  Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. Your Excite User ID automatically identifies your computer - but not you - to our servers when you visit our site. **Unless you specifically tell us, Excite will never know who you are, even though we assign your computer a cookie.**  
**°** | Other companies which place advertising on our site also have the ability to assign a different cookie to you in a process that Excite does not control. But since cookies aren't useable for identifying individuals (you'll be just a number to them), these advertisers will never know who you are - **and Excite will never tell them!   **  
---  
Excite is trying to always provide you with a compelling reason to come back and visit our site again:  
**°** | We use the information to provide personalized portions of our site that are intended to provide just the information you are interested in receiving. Some of these personalized services are made available directly by Excite ("[My Excite Channel](http://my.excite.com/)" is a good example of such a personalized service). In other instances it is our partners who provide these tailored services (such as [Business & Investing by Quicken.com](http://quicken.excite.com/) or [Preview Travel's Farefinder](http://reservations.city.net/Farefinder) service).  
**°** | We analyze what our customers like and don't like about Excite's current offerings so that we can design better services.  
**°** | We use information about what you are searching for to help focus the advertisements we present to you, hopefully to make them more valuable to you.  
**°** | We develop summary - not individual - reports for our advertisers.  An example of a summary report might be "12,000 people clicked on Advertisement "X" today and of those people, 35% had previously indicated they had an interest in sports." The people that make it possible for you to use Excite for free - our advertisers - need this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are. We **never** tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements unless you have specifically told us this is acceptable.  
**°** | And occasionally we will send you email communications to provide information which we think you will find useful, including information about new products and services from Excite. It is our policy only to send email to customers who give us permission to do so. In every such email, we will also have instructions on how to unsubscribe so that you will not receive any future emails from Excite if you do not wish to, or you can avoid receiving them altogether \- see the "Opt-out Policy " below.  
---  
The individually identifiable information that you provide will be used extensively within the Excite Network to provide a personalized experience to you. It will also be shared with Excite's partners that provide some of the personalized content on our site (see "Use of the Information" above for some examples) and other third parties unrelated to offerings on the Excite Network, but only if you have given your permission for this to occur. Our privacy guarantee to you remains unchanged:  
   
  
**Excite will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer's permission.**  
  
   
Other companies which place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising or content. Excite does not control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers or content providers directly if you have any questions about their use of this information. Additionally, Excite does not control the information collection and distribution policies on sites off of the Excite Network (which consists of excite.com, webcrawler.com, mckinley.com, and city.net) although we do encourage our co-branding partners to adopt privacy policies similar to this one and to become licensees of TRUSTe.  
---  
Excite puts control over communications directed to you where it belongs: In your hands. Every time we collect name and address information about you:   
**°** | You can tell us if you don't want to be listed in service directories, such as a subscriber list to [PAL](http://pal.excite.com/go.webx?98@@pal/index.html).  
**°** | You can tell us if you don't want to receive communication from Excite such as email newsletters announcing contests or new features.  
**°** | You can tell us if you don't want to receive communication from third-party companies who offer a product or service that we think would be of value to you.  
**°** | And, of course, you can always decline to provide the personal information to us in the first place.  
---  
It is not currently possible for an Excite user to correct and update their personally identifiable information. But we are developing this capability and hope to have it available soon.  
  
**  Deleting and Deactivating**  
  
---  
Again, it is not currently possible for an Excite customer to delete or deactivate their information from the database. However, when we can offer you the ability to update your own personally identifiable information, we will also be able to allow you to deactivate this information, if you so desire.
