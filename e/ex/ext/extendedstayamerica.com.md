Privacy Policy

Effective as of April,17 2018 

  1. 1.       Introduction



Extended Stay America, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “Extended Stay America”, “we”, “us” or “our”)  own and operate this website. This Privacy Policy applies to [www.extendedstayamerica.com](http://www.extendedstayamerica.com/) and any other website (each a “Site”) or software applications for use on or through computers and mobile devices (each an, “App”) offered by us, which reference or link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Service”) . We at Extended Stay recognize that our users may have questions about the information we collect through the Service and how we use it. In order to address those questions, we have developed this Privacy Policy.

By accessing and using the Service, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to be legally bound by it. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using the Service.

  1. 2.      Types of Information Collected



Personal Information

Through the Service, we may collect both personal information and technical information. Personal information describes information that is about you and from which you may be identifiable. Personal information relates to an individual consumer or business contact. We may collect the following personal information from you: name, address, telephone number, email address, and credit card or financial account information, depending on the service requested from us. We don’t require that you provide this information to us in order to view a Site or have access to its content. We may, however, collect personal information to process a reservation in our network of hotels, if you elect to participate in our hotel rewards program, or to participate in any other promotion made available online or through a mobile app to which this Privacy Policy applies. If you voluntarily sign up to be on our mailing list or create an account with us through the Service, or if you send us a message through the Service, we will collect personal information to fulfill or respond to your requests. We may also collect personal information that you provide to us via our social media pages, including your social media account identifier and profile picture.

By initiating any activity or transaction through the Service that uses financial information, you consent to providing your financial information to us and our service providers processing the transaction to the extent required to provide the payment services to you. When we collect payment information directly from you, like credit and debit card numbers and expiration dates, we transmit this payment data directly from you to the card processing company and it is not viewed or stored by us.

Technical Information

Technical information relates to such things as how many people visit a Site, which pages they access, the information they download, the type of browser and operating systems they use, the name of their internet service provider, device type used to access the website (i.e., computer or mobile device), geographical data, the click path taken through the website, use of features or applications on the Site, and other information of this general type. When you visit our Site we will automatically collect technical information and combine it with similar information collected about all other visitors to the Site. By collecting this information we learn how best to develop our Site to meet the needs and desires of our customers and visitors.  We also collect this information for security purposes, to facilitate Site navigation, to personalize your experience while visiting the Site, to maintain and help diagnose problems with our Site, to build up marketing profiles, to aid strategic development and to help administer and audit usage of the Site.

When you download and use an App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.

When you use access our Service from a mobile device, we may collect information such as your unique device ID and your location information.

Information From Other Sources

We may also receive information about you (including personal information) from third parties. For example, we may receive information about you from our affiliate marketers who refer you to us for services, or if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from us, that website will forward to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested.  We may combine the information we receive from these third parties with information we collect through our Site. In those cases, we will continue to apply this Privacy Policy to any personal information received pursuant to this Privacy Policy, unless we have disclosed otherwise.

  1. 3.      Methods of Information Collection



As noted above, only technical information is collected from people who just visit the Site and do not take any further actions on the Site. Visitors who make reservations through the Site, email us, sign up for mailings, or otherwise communicate with us online will usually be required to provide personal information to us. Without this personal information, we would be unable to respond to your inquiries, purchase requests, and/or other requests. The same holds true when using the App to make reservations or otherwise communicate with us – if you request services from us through the App, you will usually be required to provide personal information to us.

  1. 4.      Cookies and “Passive” Collection of Information



Whenever you visit or interact with a Site, we, as well as our service providers, may use assorted technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the website is accessed and used, including by use of “cookies.” Cookies are pieces of information that are placed on an individual visitor’s hard drive for the purpose of keeping records. Cookies can enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while visiting a particular website.The cookie is not intended to obtain any personal information about you or provide us with a way to contact you. We do use the cookie to help us identify website features and content which are of the greatest interest, so we will be able to enhance this website to provide you with a great web experience. If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer, the “help” portion of your browser’s toolbar will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting any new cookies, how to disable cookies altogether, how to delete cookies once they have been placed on your computer and how to have your browser notify you when a new cookie has been received. Although you may take advantage of these features of your browser when visiting or viewing this Site, please remember that cookies may help you take full advantage of the newest website features at this Site, and we would encourage you to leave these cookies activated during your visit. Another tool that may be employed by us is a web beacon, pixel tag or similar technology. These tools help us determine various types of technical information. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or via newsletters, web beacons may be used to determine how many of the emails sent were actually opened. Please note, however, that in general, most images viewed as part of a web page can be used as a web beacon. We are also likely to passively collect such other technical information as the IP address of your computer/mobile device and the type of browser that you are using.

  1. 5.      Do Not Track Requests; Third Party Tracking[](file:///C:/Users/lsatterfield/Documents/Extended%20Stay%20Privacy%20Policy%20Comments.docx#_msocom_4)



Certain web browsers allow consumers to enable "do not track" signals through which a consumer can signal to websites and online services whether the consumer approves of the collection of personal information about its online activities over time and across third-party websites and online services. Our Site does not change its behavior when receiving "Do Not Track" signals from browser software. Third parties, other than our vendors (such as our website analytics provider), do not have authorization from us to track which websites you visited prior to and after visiting our Site. That said, we cannot control third party tracking and there may be some third party tracking that occurs without our knowledge or consent.

  1. 6.      Questionnaires and Surveys[](file:///C:/Users/lsatterfield/Documents/Extended%20Stay%20Privacy%20Policy%20Comments.docx#_msocom_5)



Users of the Service may be asked to complete surveys or opinion polls regarding their interests, thoughts, opinions and attitudes. These types of surveys help us understand the needs and desires of our customers. Sample answers to such surveys may be posted to this website. Such sample answers could possibly include some of your personal information, such as your first name or city, but we will not include your last name, phone number, street address or email address as part of any publicly available posting of survey results.

  1. 7.      How Extended Stay Uses Your Personal Information



We collect and use your personal information for a variety of business purposes, including to communicate with you and respond to your requests, to provide the services that you request, to communicate with you about our services, to fulfill and complete your transactions, to provide you with information about your services and offerings, to administer, to manage and respond to feedback and other questions, to comply with applicable laws and regulatory obligations, and to do all things necessary to administer, protect, improve and manage the Service.

For example, if you make a reservation or purchase through the Service, we use your personal information to set up your account and/or process your order. If you email us, agree to follow-up contact from us, or ask to be placed on mailings lists that we may maintain, we may contact you. For example, you may receive marketing and promotional materials, we may respond to your comments or questions or we may contact you if necessary during the course of processing a service you requested through the Service. In addition to the uses listed above, we may use your personal information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, as part of a statistical website usage analysis, and/or to improve the features and content of the Service. We may also use your personal information to assist in delivery of content that is customized to your interests. This type of customized content may eventually include such things as banners and hotel information. We do not collect personal information on an automatic basis, but we may combine technical information (which is automatically collected) with your previously submitted personal information.

  1. 8.      Advertising Partners[](file:///C:/Users/lsatterfield/Documents/Extended%20Stay%20Privacy%20Policy%20Comments.docx#_msocom_6)



We do not currently deliver banner advertisements to other websites, either along with or through an advertising partner. If and when our Site chooses to work with an advertising partner for such a purpose, various forms of tracking may be used by said advertising partner(s). Please be sure to check the user agreements and privacy policies of any company serving banner advertisements, either on behalf of our Site or on behalf of any other website so advertised, should you be interested in the content of the policies governing their conduct.

  1. 9.      Disclosure of Information to Third Party Service Providers



We during the course of our business use third-party companies and individuals to perform a variety of functions, such as financial institutions that assist us with payment transactions and companies that assist to maintain the Service. We may disclose your personal information to third parties to protect the security and integrity of the Service, to correct technical problems and malfunctions in the Service, to technically process your information, to provide services requested, to help us market our services, to provide analytics or to take precautions against liability. We may also share information with our professional advisors (including lawyers and accountants) that assist us in carrying out our business activities. These third parties may have access to information, both personal and technical, that is collected through the Service. Such third-party providers are not to use the information to which they are granted access except for the purpose for which they were selected to work with us (or as required by law).[](file:///C:/Users/lsatterfield/Documents/Extended%20Stay%20Privacy%20Policy%20Comments.docx#_msocom_7)
