# Extended Stay Hotels - Privacy Policy

We are committed to protecting our guests’ privacy at Extended Stay HotelsSM and its hotel brands, including Extended Stay DeluxeSM, Extended Stay America ®, Homestead Studio Suites®, StudioPLUS Deluxe Studios®, and Crossland Economy Studios®. We understand that you may have questions about how our website collects and uses the information that you provide to us. We have prepared this statement to inform you of the privacy principles that govern our website.

We collect information from our users at several different points on our website. We will not sell, share, or otherwise distribute your personal data to third parties. When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you to provide you with a particular service, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information that we need. For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our hotels, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number and room preference to process your reservation. We will use your email address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, may use other information to contact you for help in processing your reservation.

We use a third-party service provider to help us gather and analyze information about our customers. Our service provider’s only role is to help us conduct our business and deliver relevant products and services. If you would like to deactivate our ability to analyze your anonymous browsing and purchase behavior through the use of this service or find out more about our service provider, including its privacy policy and how to opt out, [Click Here](mailto:marketing@extendedstay.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Inquiry). 

**Online Advertising**   
We use a third-party company to serve online advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. During this process, we may collect information about your visits to our website. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a technology commonly referred to as a Web Beacon or Action Tag, which we place on various pages of our website and allows the third party to collect anonymous information. The information tracked is completely anonymous; it contains no personal information about any individuals. The anonymous information collected is used only to track our advertising's effectiveness and improve our advertising.

**Surveys & Contests**   
From time-to-time our website requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this website. 

**Special Offers**   
We send all new Suite Offers members a welcoming email to confirm membership. Established members will receive information on services and special deals. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice/opt-out below. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**   
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as user’s zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the My Account page or by emailing us using the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact/default.html "Contact Us") page. 

**Choice/Opt-out**   
It is our intention to only send you email communications that will be useful to you and that you want to receive. Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our website at the point where we ask for the information. All our emails promoting special deals to our Suite Offers members contain a link to opt-out of receiving future emails. You may also use the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact/default.html "Contact Us") page to opt-out of receiving emails in the future. 

**Site Security**   
We treat the information that you provide to us as confidential information. Accordingly, such information is subject to our security procedures and policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. When we ask you for credit card data and other personal information for your travel purchases on our secure server, you are protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. We also use SSL on other pages of our website where you enter personally identifiable information. This technology allows us to use encryption tools necessary to protect personal information transmitted between your computer and our server. Once your secure server receives your encrypted personal information, it is translated back into its original form and stored in our off-line database. 

**Site and Service Updates**   
We also send the user website and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

**Other Sites**    
Extended Stay Hotels is only responsible for the privacy statement and content of this website. We are not responsible for the data collection and use practices and privacy policy of or the use of cookies on third-party websites that you may access from our website. 

**Legal Issues**   
This is a United States website and is subject to the laws of the United States and the State of South Carolina. We will disclose personally identifiable information without your permission when required by law, or in good faith belief that such action is necessary to protect against harmful activities to our guests, visitors, associates, or property, or to others.  

**Notification of Changes**   
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post a link to those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under which circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
