                                              PRIVACY POLICY
This notice discloses the online data collection and use practices of Extreme Music Library Ltd of 30
Golden Square, London W1F 9LD, England (“Extreme”, “we”, “us”, “our”). Extreme may modify, alter or
otherwise update this policy at any time, and the date the most recent set of changes will be displayed at
the “Last Updated” legend above. “Website” shall mean www.extrememusic.com and any other websites
and online services operated by us. "User" means you, the Website end-user. We encourage you to
review this policy from time to time. You will signify your acceptance of this privacy policy when you
request download access to the Website or take a license of rights to use our production music. Your
continued usage of the Website or your continued licensing of our production music following the posting
of any changes to this policy will mean you accept those changes.
1.       Privacy Practices and Policies & Our Use of Your Personal Information. Your e-mail
address and other personally identifying data will be known to Extreme Music only when you voluntarily
submit such information to the Website. We may use this personal information to contact you if we
change our services or terms or if we need to give you notice under those terms.
This Website is controlled by us from our offices in the United Kingdom (“UK”). Personal information
collected from the Site is processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act"), which
regulates the processing of personal data in the UK. We are registered as a data controller in
accordance with the Act and comply with UK data protection and privacy law.
If you choose to visit the Website from outside the UK, you do so at your own risk, with the understanding
that personal information collected from the Website may be collected, stored and used in a country
whose privacy laws may be different and less protective than those of your home country.
We use your personal information for various purposes such as fulfilling orders, responding to requests
for information, and providing customer assistance. The information about your licensing of our
production music may be used to send you information that we believe may be of interest to you, such as
information about music or products or services offered by Extreme or its affiliates. If you prefer, you can
choose not to receive such information from Extreme by indicating to us your preference in an e-mail
message to: extreme@extrememusic.com or at the time you provide to us the requested information. In
addition, with each communication you receive from Extreme, you will be given the opportunity to indicate
if you do not wish to receive future communications.
Extreme reserves the right to disclose any content, records, or electronic communication of any kind
(including personal information or private electronic communication transmitted on the Website) under the
following circumstances: (a) with your consent; (b) as may be required by law or court order; (c) to
persons or companies with whom Extreme contracts to carry out the internal operations of the website or
our business; or (d) under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety or property of our Users,
the public, or ourselves. Extreme also reserves the right to reject any order or to request additional
information from any User.
2.       With Whom We Share Information. As a general rule, we will not disclose any personal
information we collect from you without your consent. However, we may disclose personal information in


special cases, when we reasonably believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify,
contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either
intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property. We may disclose User information when we believe
in good faith that the law requires it. We may also disclose your personal information to any member of
our group of companies, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its
subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006 (whether based within or outside
the European Economic Area).
We may share with others, at our discretion, certain aggregate statistical data about licensing and the use
of our production music. No personal information (such as names or email addresses) will be identifiable
from such statistics.
We may transfer, sell or assign any of the information described above, including personally identifiable
information, to third parties, as a result of the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of
substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation of Extreme.
3.       Where We Store Your Personal Information. All information you provide to us is stored on
secure servers hosted by us or third parties providing hosting, payment or other services for us.
The information we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the
European Economic Area ("EEA"), including any destination where the privacy laws of the country
concerned may be different and less protective than those of EEA countries. It may also be processed by
personnel operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such personnel may be
engaged in, among other things, the processing of your payment details (where applicable) and the
provision of support services.
By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing and processing.
4.       Security. Extreme strictly protects the security of your personal information and your choices for
its intended use. While Extreme cannot guarantee that unauthorized access will never occur, Extreme
takes great care in maintaining the security of your personal information and in preventing unauthorized
access to it through the use of appropriate technology and internal procedures. One easy and important
way to protect your personal information is to keep your account password confidential and to close your
browser when you are away from your computer.
5.       Modify/opt-out. If at any point you no longer wish to receive communications from Extreme, or if
you wish to check and edit the personal information we hold about you at any time, please forward such
requests to us at the relevant office address which may be found in the “Dealers” section on the Website.
6.       Cookies / Tracking Technology & IP Addresses. For each visitor to the Website, Extreme's
web server automatically recognizes and stores information, such as the visitor's IP address/domain
name combination and any referring websites. We use this information to understand visitor traffic
patterns through our websites for purposes such as enhancing their usability and allow us to customize

                                             COOKIES POLICY
This Cookies Policy relates to our website at www.extrememusic.com and any other websites and
online services operated by us (collectively, the “Website”).
This Cookies Policy explains how we use cookies on the Website, and forms part of our Privacy
Policy. By using the Website, you consent to such use in accordance with this Cookies Policy.
About cookies
Cookies are widely used to allow websites to function efficiently. A "cookie" is a small text file that
(depending on your browser settings) is deposited on the hard drive of your computer or mobile
phone (each, a “device”) when you visit a website. The cookie may be sent back to that site when
you visit again, and may then be used by the server to identify and track your use of the website.
There are two main types of cookies. A “session cookie” is a temporary cookie that only remains in
the cookie file of your browser until you leave a website. A “persistent” cookie is a long-term cookie
that will be stored by your browser until its set expiry date (unless you delete it before the expiry date).
How we use cookies
In general, we use certain types of cookie:
         to identify you as you use the Website;
         (where applicable) to help us authenticate you as a Member and/or Registered User and to
          give you access to your user profile;
         to customise and personalise your experience of the Website; and
         to compile anonymous statistics about the use of the Website.
These cookies do not contain any information that, in itself, personally identifies you and do not
provide us with access to the rest of your device. We may, however, associate the information
contained in cookies with personal information that you have provided to us separately.
More particularly, here is a list of the main cookies that we use on the Website, and what each is used
for.
  Cookie name               Cookie type                      Purpose
  __utma Cookie             Persistent                       This cookie keeps track of the number of
                                                             times a visitor has been to the Website
                                                             pertaining to the cookie, when their first visit
                                                             was, and when their last visit occurred.
                                                             Google Analytics uses the information from
                                                             this cookie to calculate information such as

                                                            __utmc takes a timestamp of the exact
                                                            moment in time when a visitor leaves the

                                                            it expires. As __utmc has no way of knowing
                                                            when a user closes their browser or leaves a
                                                            website, so it waits 30 minutes for another
                                                            pageview to happen, and if it doesn’t, it

  __utmz Cookie           Persistent                        This cookie keeps track of where a Website
                                                            visitor came from, what search engine they
                                                            used, what link they clicked on, what
                                                            keyword they used, and where they were in
                                                            the world when you accessed a website. It

  ASP.NET_SessionId       Session                           This cookie stores and retrieves values for a
  Cookie                                                    Website user as the user navigates
                                                            ASP.NET pages in a Web application. HTTP
                                                            is a stateless protocol. This means that a
                                                            Web server treats each HTTP request for a
                                                            page as an independent request. The server
                                                            retains no knowledge of variable values that
                                                            were used during previous requests.
                                                            ASP.NET session state identifies requests
                                                            from the same browser during a limited time

                                                            persist variable values for the duration of that
                                                            session. By default, ASP.NET session state
                                                            is enabled for all ASP.NET applications.
