What personally identifiable information does Extensis, Inc. collect from me?  


Extensis, Inc. stores the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer when you visit our site. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to gather broad demographic information. Some personal information is gathered when you register, purchase, or download a product. At that time we ask for your name, email address, mailing address, phone, occupation, and some optional demographic information. Once you purchase or register for our services you are no longer anonymous to us. This information is utilized internally at Extensis, Inc., for the purpose of offering customer service and technical support, measuring demographics and response, and marketing of special offers. This information is used in several ways: To customize content and offers that you see, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to contact you about special offers and new products, and to offer technical support and customer service to our customers. In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you purchase on-line, submit a question to our Technical Support Team, or if you report a problem with our site or one of our services. Wherever Extensis, Inc. collects personal information we make every effort to offer you the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of future communications.  


What are "cookies" and how does Extensis, Inc. use them?  


A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages that have been visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Extensis, Inc. uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above), when you purchase on-line or download a product. In addition, cookie technology is often used to offer on-line product discounts to existing Extensis customers. Generally, we use cookies for:

  1. Downloads: when you download a demo or a product at extensis.com, we use a cookie to store your user ID. We do not store additional personal information about you. We use this ID to identify you in our database, to save you from having to fill out our registration form if you have already registered, and to track page visits.  

  2. Purchases: when you purchase a product at extensis.com, we use a cookie to store your user ID. We do not store additional personal information about you. We do not store financial data about you. We use this ID to identify you in our database, to save you from having to fill out our registration form if you have already registered, and to track page visits. If you’ve set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use our site. However, you do need cookies to receive select promotional and discount offers.  




How does Extensis, Inc. use my information?  


Extensis, Inc. uses any information voluntarily given by our customers to enhance their experience on our site, to provide personalized offers or to better prepare future offerings based on the interests of our users.  


Who is collecting information?

When you are at extensis.com and offer us information, your information is being collected by Extensis, Inc. alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. Promotions that run on extensis.com may be sponsored by companies other than Extensis, Inc. or may be co-sponsored by Extensis, Inc. and another company. Some data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don’t want your data to be shared. Please be aware that Extensis partners or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those linked Web sites are not covered by this privacy statement.  


With whom does Extensis, Inc. share my information?  


As a general rule, Extensis, Inc. will not disclose any of your electronic contact information except when we have your explicit permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below.

  * Business Partners & Sponsors: Some data collected during an Extensis, Inc. promotion may be shared with a sponsor or partner  

  * Extensis Purchases: If you make a purchase from extensis.com, the financial information obtained during your transaction, such as your credit card number, is held solely by Extensis, Inc. and will not be shared.  

  * Third Party Data & Data in the Aggregate: Under confidentiality agreements, Extensis, Inc. may match user information with third party data. Also, Extensis, Inc. may disclose aggregated user statistics (e.g., 40% of our members are graphic designers) as a means of measuring demographics and the effectiveness of our services.  

  * Other: Under extreme conditions, Extensis, Inc. may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Extensis, Inc.'s rights or property, other extensis.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Extensis, Inc. may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.  




What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?

If you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from Extensis, we may occasionally send you e-mail about product updates or special offers and services that we feel might be of interest to you. Only Extensis, Inc. (or agents working on behalf of Extensis, Inc. and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these e-mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you register your information with Extensis. Or, at any time you can choose to unsubscribe from our mailing list by visiting our Unsubscribe URL: http://www.extensis.com/unsubscribe . Once you are unsubscribed, you will no longer receive such offers or mailings. Please allow two to three weeks for unsubscribe requests to take effect. In addition, you are also able to unsubscribe to our mailing list by clicking on that same URL in our newsletters unsubscribe yourself from future communications. Please allow two to three weeks for the actual cancellation to take effect. If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify our current opt-in email base by email.  


How does Extensis, Inc. protect my personal financial information?  


Keeping your personal financial information private is vitally important to us. As with all personal information, Extensis, Inc. will never rent or sell your personal financial information. Any time we ask for a credit card number in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes, we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.  


What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?

Your personal information that has been offered to Extensis, Inc. has been done through an encrypted format, to prevent loss, misuse or alteration of the data. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Extensis, Inc. cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.  


What else should I know about my privacy?

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online—for example; on message boards, through email, or in chat areas—that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you’re online.
