**Extensis and your privacy**

Updated as of: June 2, 2016.

Extensis respects your privacy as a visitor to our website(s) and use of Extensis resources. Our websites consist of websites produced and maintained by Extensis and/or an Extensis service provider, including but not limited to www.extensis.com (collectively the “Website(s)”). Through the Website(s), you may access and use Extensis resources including but not limited to Extensis online services, forums, blogs, chat rooms, support site, product and services information, stores, knowledge base articles, accounts, and channel partner and affiliate programs (collectively the “Extensis Resources”). The Website(s) and Extensis Resources are collectively referred to herein as the “Services”.

It is important that you understand what information we collect from you through your use of the Services, how we protect, share and use your information, and your options regarding information we may collect about you. We have established this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to provide you with such information and want to assure you that we will not use your information except as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is: (a) incorporated into our Terms of Use; (b) linked throughout our Website(s) and Extensis Resources, as appropriate; and (c) referenced in our End User License Agreements and other documents and materials, as appropriate. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before accessing and using the Services. By accessing and using the Services, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and any updates thereof.

**1\. Information We Collect.**

  * **1.1 Personal Information.** We may collect Personal Information that you provide to us. Personal Information is information that can be used to identify you as an individual such as your name, email, telephone number, home address, billing information, passwords or other online contact information, and demographic information (such as zip code, age). The types of Personal Information we collect may vary depending on your use of the Services. We may also obtain Personal Information from our service providers and will handle such Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Our service providers who collect information on our behalf are obligated to abide by all applicable data protection laws.


  * **1.2 Information We Collect Automatically.**


  * **(a) Usage Information.** Whenever you access or use the Services, we, as well as our service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Services are accessed and used (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the page served, the time and date, the preceding page views, and your use of features or applications in connection with the Services. This information helps us to improve our Services and your interactions with our Services.


  * **(b) Device Identifier.** We, as well as our service providers, automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) from your computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device (“Device”) you use to access the Services. A Device Identifier is a number that is assigned to your Device when you access our Website(s), and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page movements, help identify you and your interests, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.


  * **(c) Cookies; Pixel Tags.** The technologies used by the Services to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, include and are not limited to: cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Services), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed). Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your use of the Services and your activities on such social networking sites. We, or our service providers, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation, to perform analytics, and personalize your experience while visiting our Services. A pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.


  *   * We do not require that you consent to the placement of the cookies described above. To learn how you may be able to reduce the number of cookies you receive from us, or delete cookies that have already been installed in your browser’s cookie folder, or prevent tracking activities, please refer to your browser’s tools or help menu or other instructions related to your browser. If you do disable or opt out of receiving cookies, please be aware that some Services, such as our store, may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.



**2\. How We Use Information.** We use the information we collect for a variety of business purposes, such as: (a) to respond to any questions and requests you may have; (b) to provide you with access to certain products and services, including those of our affiliates and partners; (c) to verify your identity; (d) to process transactions; (e) to communicate with you about your account and activities on the Services; (f) to provide you with newsletters, updates, special offers and advertisements; and (g) for any purposes which may have been disclosed to you at the time you provided your Personal Information to us. We may also use information we collect to test, enhance and improve the Services, our products, and product related service offerings.

**3\. When We Disclose or Share Information.** Except as described below, we will not provide your Personal Information to any third parties without your consent. We may share non-Personal Information such as de-identified aggregate data and Usage Information with third parties. We may also share your information as disclosed to you at the time you provide your information.

  * **3.1 Service Providers.** We may share your Personal Information with our service providers who provide services on our behalf such as website hosting providers, marketing services, data analysis, payment and credit card processing, order fulfillment, information technology and other similar services. When we share Personal Information with our service providers, we require that they first contractually agree to comply with reasonable and appropriate privacy and security standards.


  * **3.2 Business Transfers.** We may change ownership or corporate organization while providing the Services. In the event we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as a part of that transaction.


  * **3.3 Legal Disclosures.** Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose your information to third parties in order to comply with a legal obligation such as a subpoena, warrant, judicial or administrative order, or as otherwise required by applicable law. We may also disclose information where we, in good faith, deem it appropriate or necessary to enforce or prevent a violation of our Terms of Use or other applicable policies, to address fraud, security or technical issues, to respond to an emergency, or to otherwise protect our Services, clients and visitors.



**4\. Third Parties That You Agree to Share Your Information With.** While using our Services, you may elect to receive information and/or marketing offers from a third party or otherwise consent to the sharing of your information with a third party such as a social networking site like Facebook or Twitter. If you agree to share your information with a third party, your disclosure will be subject to such third party’s privacy policy and business practices and not this Privacy Policy. For example, we may direct you to a third party payment service to process payments made through the Services. If you wish to make such payment, your Personal Information will be collected by such third party and not by us, and will be subject to such third party’s privacy policy. The inclusion of any third party link in the Services does not imply any endorsement of the linked site or service by us. In addition, when you post or disclose any of your information in public forums such a blog, bulletin board, chat room, user commenting features or other interactive sharing or social feature that may be offered or accessed through the Service, the information may also become available to other users and the general public. Please exercise appropriate care prior to disclosing any of your information online.

**5\. How We Will Protect Your Personal Information.** We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect your Personal Information, including the implementation and maintenance of organizational, technical and administrative procedures to prevent unauthorized or unlawful access, disclosure or destruction. Users of the Services must also do their part in protecting the data, systems, networks and service they are utilizing. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you use the Services and provide us with your information at your own risk. If you have reason to believe that your Personal Information is no longer secure (for example, your Extensis account password may have been compromised), please immediately contact us at [info@extensis.com](mailto:info@extensis.com).

**6\. Your Choices On How We Use Your Information.**

  * **6.1 Your Personal Information.** You control the Personal Information that you provide to us in connection with the Services. If you do not want to submit Personal Information necessary or required for use of certain Services, then you will not be able to access and use such Services. You may, at any time, update, correct, or delete certain Personal Information that you have provided to us by editing your registered user information or contacting us at [info@extensis.com](mailto:info@extensis.com). In accordance with our routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal Information you have submitted through the Services. We are not obligated to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. Please note that it may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons. We will endeavor to retain your information for as long as your Extensis Account is active or as needed to provide you with certain Services. We will also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.


  * **6.2 Marketing Preferences.** If you wish to remove yourself from individual communications, including marketing promotions, advertisements, updates and email newsletters, simply click the unsubscribe or subscription management link in the communication. We will comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please also note that if you choose not to receive marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you important administrative and transactional messages (i.e., service notifications, changes to our terms, conditions and policies) in connection with your Services. Because this information is important to your interaction with us, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.



**7\. Use of Services by Minors.** We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of the United States and similar laws around the world where applicable to our Services. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children without proper parental consent. If you believe that we may have collected personal information from someone under the age of thirteen (13), or under the applicable age of consent in your country, without parental consent, please contact us at [info@extensis.com](mailto:info@extensis.com) and we will promptly address this issue.

**8\. International Transfers of Personal Information.** We are a U.S. based, global company. We may transfer your Personal Information to any international affiliate or service provider, who may be located in a different county to you. If you utilize our Services from the European Union or Switzerland, or any other region with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you may be transferring your personal data outside of those jurisdictions to the United States. The United States does not have the same data protection laws as the European Union, Switzerland and other regions. By providing Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, you consent to the use of your Personal Information in accordance with this Policy and the transfer of your Personal Information to the United States.

We are committed to complying with applicable U.S and E.U. laws regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. We are aware of the current discussions and negotiations regarding the transfer of personal data from the EU/EEA to a non-EU/EEA country, such as the U.S, and will continue to monitor the situation and update our policies as needed.

**9\. California Privacy Rights.** In addition to the rights set forth in this Privacy Policy, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents who are our customers to request certain information regarding disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to [info@extensis.com](mailto:info@extensis.com).

**10.Changes**. We may update the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on our Services prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our Privacy Policy.
