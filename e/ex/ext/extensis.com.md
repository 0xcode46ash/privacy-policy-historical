Your personal information that has been offered to Extensis Corporation has been done through an encrypted format, to prevent loss, misuse or alteration of the data. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

> Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online—for example; on message boards, through email, or in chat areas—that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 
> 
> Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you’re online.
