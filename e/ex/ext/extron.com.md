Extron Electronics Privacy Policy

Extron Electronics cares about your right to privacy. This policy explains how we intend to handle any personal identification information you give us online. It does not apply to personal identification information that we collect offline. Personal identification information enables us to identify you, your e-mail address, name, business, etc.

#### How We Collect and Use Personal Identification Information

The Extron Web site is available for use by anyone, regardless of their willingness to disclose personal identification information. Sharing your personal identification information makes it easier for you to: 

  * Request information or materials concerning our products and services.
  * Receive personalized newsletters and other messages on our products and services that we feel may be relevant to your interests. Your personal identity information generally facilitates future communication with you. For example, your Extron Web site registration information and customer profile will be used to generate personalized Web content and send you Extron E-News, a monthly e-mail newsletter (if you select that option), and to occasionally send you informative e-mails about Extron products and services.
  * Purchase Extron products online (Extron dealers only).
  * Download software that supports Extron products.
  * View specialized content such as pricing, product availability, and special events (available to Extron dealers only).
