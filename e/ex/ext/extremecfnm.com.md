 **AdultXfun.com 2257 Statement** \- 22nd June 2005: AdultXfun.com 2257 Statement. We recommend our US Affiliates read this statment  
AdultXfun.com is a European company and as such is bound by EU laws. The European community has developed a directive that was passed by the Council of Ministers in October 1995 and came into force in October 1998, obliging all member states to block the flow of personal data to states without adequate protection, subject to the derogations listed in Article 26. America maintained that self-regulation was a preferred approach to dealing with privacy issues. America is not in line with the European community on this subject. However all webmasters, as we are, should be bound by the laws that are in affect in whatever country you reside in, i.e. promo material used on websites must be compliant with your local laws. AdultXfun.com is bound by the EU law which is we are not allowed to issue personal information without adequate protection of that information. The new 2257 regulations do not allow us to comply without breaking EU laws. We will be seeking further clarification of our position with our legal council including the possibility of filing a TRO on behalf of our AdultXfun.com members. We are working on a number of ideas to assist our American friends, members and affiliates. Questions regarding this topic can be directed to affiliates@adultxfun.com

 **New Hosted Pages** \- 19th January 2005: AdultXFun now features a dedicated section of hosted pages. Why waste time offline designing your own pages, when you can pick and choose from our ever-growing selection. Each page has a distinctive look and feel and  
captures the attention with great graphics and the key phrases that make us stand out from the crowd. [CLICK HERE](http://www.adultxfun.com/index.php/hosted)
