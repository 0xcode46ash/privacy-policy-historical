**Our users are given the opportunity to �opt-out� of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.  For example, our order form has an �opt-out� mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don�t want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.

**Notification of Changes  
**If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.
