 **Terms**

Beacons and Tags: Beacons and tags enable online advertising companies to collect data and serve advertising on web sites by allowing communication between a web browser and an ad server. A beacon (or web beacon) is a small transparent image that is placed on a web page. A tag is a small piece of computer code that is run by the web browser.

Cookie: A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a web browser by a website or ad server. By saving information in a cookie, websites and servers can remember preferences or recognize browsers from one visit to another or from one website to another.

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that by itself can be used to identify a specific individual. PII includes such things as name, address, phone number, and email address.

 **What information do we collect?**

From Advertisement Viewers: Beacons and cookies collect non-PII activity data and ad viewership information. None of this information is personally identifiable.

From Survey Respondents: All of the above, as well as any brand study related data that is voluntarily shared by the survey responder. None of this information is PII, but some (geographic location, age, etc.) has the potential to become PII if merged with other types of data.

Publicly shared information: We collect publicly shared information on social media platforms that directly relates to the advertisements and brands of our customers.

 **What do we use collected data for?**

We generate advertising campaign analysis reports for our customers (advertisers and their agencies) using anonymized aggregated non-personally identifiable information.

We use cookies to determine, based on observed activity around an advertising campaign, whether or not the consumer should be served a survey.

We use audience and brand lift survey responses to generate aggregated anonymized reports on the effectiveness of our customers’ advertising campaigns.

We use publicly available information found on social media platforms to report social sentiment to our customers regarding their advertisements and brands.

 **How do we protect your information?**

Extreme Reach only reports the information that it collects from digital advertising campaigns in the aggregate to our customers in order to provide them with a statistical analysis of ad viewership and related data. Outside of this context, Extreme Reach does not sell any information to third-parties.

 **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer our collected information to outside parties, except as discussed above for the limited purposes of Extreme Reach’s ad viewership reporting to our customers. We may also release collected information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety.

 **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance**

Because we value your privacy we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.

 **ER Digital Platform Privacy Policy Only**

The ER Digital Platform Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through our ER Digital Platform and not to information collected offline or through use of our website.

 **Changes to This Policy**

Extreme Reach reserves the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of the ER Digital Platform Privacy Policy at any time without notice. We will post changes to our privacy policy clearly and quickly to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and where we disclose it.

 **Opt-out**

Extreme Reach logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data and browser type from visitors and users of the Extreme Reach public website and advertising platform. We track and log this information in order to automate functions, continually streamline our client’s workflow, support the latest technologies and provide information that is most relevant to our visitors and clients.

Extreme Reach also tracks and logs conversion, click and viewing data from the websites of companies for which we serve advertisements (“advertisers”) and the websites and online services on which we serve advertisements (“publishers”). This anonymous data is used to track general advertising impression and response activities, so our clients can understand which ad experiences are most relevant and resonant with audiences.

Advertisements within the Extreme Reach Platform are encoded with one or more of the following based on Customer orders and preferences: Closed Captioning, BVS Watermark, Nielsen Watermark, V-Chip and Teletrax. Nielsen encoding enables Nielsen to provide services to clients. In order to opt-out of Nielsen encoding, simply click the “opt-out” checkbox on the Advertiser page within the Platform. Nielsen encoding allows Nielsen to access certain related metadata which they may use to inform their services and provide metadata and services to Extreme Reach and third parties. Nielsen will have no access to that metadata if you click the “opt out” check box.

For some advertising solutions, Extreme Reach occasionally gathers information via cookies to provide clients with aggregated campaign information that enables them to produce and run the most relevant, engaging advertisements for their consumer audience. The cookie data is anonymous, does not contain any information that personally identifies any user and is only used in aggregate.

Consumers can opt-out to suspend ER Digital data collection for the browser in question. The consumer’s ER Digital tracking cookie will be deleted from the consumer’s browser. An ER Digital opt-out cookie will be installed on the browser for the sole purpose of remembering and respecting the consumer’s opt-out status.

Please note that ER Digital will continue to record consumer activity around a campaign, such as impressions and clicks, even after opting out. Opting out suspends the storage of an ER Digital browser-associated consumer profile.
