# Exvo.com Privacy Policy

Welcome to Exvo.com!

## 1\. Introduction

Exvo.com’s Customer Privacy Policy covers the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that may be collected by Exvo.com anytime you interact with Exvo.com, such as when you visit our website, when you purchase Exvo.com products and services, or when you call our sales or support associates.

Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal information. Your privacy is a priority at Exvo.com, and we go to great lengths to protect it.

## 2\. Why is personal information collected?

We collect your personal information because it helps us deliver a superior level of customer service. It enables us to give you convenient access to our products and services and focus on categories of greatest interest to you. In addition, your personal information helps us keep you posted on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and events that you might like to hear about.

## 3\. What information we collect and how we may use it

There are a number of situations in which your personal information may help us give you better products. For example: We may ask for your personal information when you’re discussing a service issue on the phone with an associate, downloading information, registering for a seminar, participating in an online survey, or purchasing a product.

When you interact with Exvo.com, we may collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences; your credit card information and information about the Exvo product you own/subscribe to; and information relating to a support or service issue.

We also collect information for market research purposes to gain a better understanding of our customers and thus provide more valuable service.

We may use personal information to provide products that you have requested as well as for auditing, research, and analysis to improve Exvo.com’s products.

## 4\. Your Exvo ID and related information

The Exvo.com website, as well as Exvo.com services such as Exvo ID, allows you to create an “Exvo ID” based on your personal information. This convenient service saves you time and allows for easier use of our web services.

Here’s how it works: You create a personal profile — providing your name, phone number, email address, and in some cases your mailing address or a credit card number — and choose a password. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal Exvo ID — in many cases simply your email address, because it’s unique and easy to remember.

The next time you order from the Exvo.com Store or register a new product, all you need to do is enter your Exvo ID and password; the system looks up the information it needs to assist you. In addition, if you update the information associated with your Exvo ID it will be available for all your transactions with Exvo.com globally.

Exvo.com also enables you to forward information, to family members, friends or colleagues. To fulfill your request, Exvo.com may require personal information about the person to whom you are sending the product or service such as their name, physical address, email address, and so on. The personal information you provide about that person is used only for the purpose for which it is collected. Exvo.com will not use the information collected to market directly to that person.

## 5\. Public Information

If you use a bulletin board or chat room on an Exvo.com website you should be aware that any information you share is visible to other users. Personally identifiable information you submit to one of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages.

Exvo.com is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. For example, if you choose to make information, which was previously non-public, available by enabling certain user features, Exvo.com will collect that information from your interaction and the information will become publicly available.

## 6\. Information Disclosure

Exvo.com takes your privacy very seriously.

Exvo.com does not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers.

Within the Exvo.com group: To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with legal entities within the Exvo.com group globally who will take steps to safeguard it in accordance with Exvo.com’s privacy policy.

With our service providers, vendors, and strategic partners:

There are also times when it may be advantageous for Exvo.com to make certain personal information about you available to companies that Exvo.com has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for Exvo.com to provide products and services to you on our behalf.

These companies may help us process information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys.

These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with Exvo.com’s policies, except if we inform you otherwise at the time of collection.

Without such information being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase products, have products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers, and content on the Exvo.com website.

At times we may be required by law or litigation to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.

## 7\. Information Protection

Exvo.com takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

The Exvo.com Store and Exvo.com Applications use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Safari, Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it’s transmitted over the Internet.

You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser.

## 8\. Information Integrity

Exvo.com has safeguards in place to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date for the purposes for which it is used. Naturally, you always have the right to access and correct the personal information you have provided.

You can help us ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by checking at http://ID.Exvo.com/ID. And you can request a copy of your personal information, your product registration history, and your interactions with our sales and support agents by contacting us at the email address below.

## 9\. Kids

Exvo.com recognizes that parents, guardians, or other adults often purchase our products for family use, including use by minors. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes, but because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of the Exvo.com purchaser of the product, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy. If a child under 13 submits personal information to Exvo.com and we learn that that personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.

## 10\. Cookies & other technologies

As is standard practice on many corporate websites, Exvo.com’s website uses “cookies” and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We also use cookies and other technologies to make sure that our online advertising is bringing customers to our products and services.

We use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on our website, to make it even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness of our customer communications. And we use cookies to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us.

For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you with a greeting the next time you visit the Exvo.com Store. Information such as your country and language — and if you’re an educator, your school — helps us provide a more useful online shopping experience.

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Exvo.com will not use the information collected to market directly to that person.

In some of our email messages we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Exvo.com website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.

## 11\. Commitment to Privacy

As we said, Exvo.com takes protecting your privacy very seriously. To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate these guidelines to Exvo.com employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.

## 12\. Updates

Exvo.com may update its privacy policy from time to time. When we change the policy in a material way a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated privacy policy.
