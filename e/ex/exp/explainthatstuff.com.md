# Privacy policy: Explain that Stuff!

_Last updated: May 19, 2012._

We take privacy issues seriously—everyone says that, but we really do. Here (in plain English) are full details explaining the careful steps we have taken to respect and protect your privacy as you use our website.

## Web server logs

Like every other website, our site is hosted on a web server (a powerful computer at our service provider) that keeps a log of all the pages and graphics it serves and where it sends them to. This is a basic feature of how web servers work. The information they log is essentially anonymous and statistical: it tells us how many people from Iceland looked at our site last Thursday, but it doesn't tell us anything personal about them. We don't know who those people were, whether they were fishermen or fighter pilots, or what colour socks they were wearing at the time.

The logs don't tell us who you are or where you live—but they do record your IP number (a number that uniquely identifies your Internet connection). They also note what you looked at or downloaded, the operating system and browser you're using, the date and time of your visit, how you came to our site, and so on. Here is an example of one line from our log, recording one hit from one visitor using the (made-up) IP number 12.34.56.78:

12.34.56.78 - - [25/May/2010:13:05:41 +0100] "GET /transformers.html HTTP/1.0" 200 19986 "http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&q=why+we+use+transformers&meta= &aq=4m&aqi=g-c1g-m4&aql=&oq=use+transformers&gs_rfai=" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)"

What can we deduce from this? That someone using computer 12.34.56.78 wanted to find out "why we use transformers" at 13:05 on Tuesday May 25 2010. They used Google India to get to our site, which they viewed using a Mozilla/Firefox browser running under Windows. That's about it. The information logged here is not personally identifiable, so we don't know who made this search or why—and frankly, we don't care. We have absolutely no interest in what individual people are doing or why.

How do we use this information? Contrary to what we've said, we don't actually look at our raw access logs: a typical day's log has hundreds of thousands of entries like the one above! Instead, we run the logs through a statistical package called [AWStats](http://awstats.sourceforge.net/) to show up daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly patterns and trends in how people use our site. (If you're really interested, you can see a [demo](http://awstats.sourceforge.net/#DEMO) of the kind of statistics that we can see.) What does this tell us? If we know certain pages are unpopular, we can improve them or discontinue them. If we know our server is about to crash because too many people are looking at our global warming page again, we can get a bigger server. If we know our RSS feeds are growing in popularity, we will start to update them more often. This is the kind of thing we do with our logs. Broadly speaking, they help us improve our website so it better meets your needs and identify any problems with our server (slow-loading pages or things like that) that we need to address.

Our website hosting system logs activity in a single file for the current month. At the end of each month, we run our statistical analysis on the log and it is then retained for the whole of the next month before being erased. So, for example, data about visits to our site in January would be logged through January, analyzed at the beginning of February and then stored for the rest of February, before being erased at the beginning of March. The absolute maximum amount of time for which information about your visit to our site is retained on our system is two months. (If you visit on the 31st of the month, the information is kept for only one month.)

## What are cookies?

When you look at websites, text, graphics, videos, and other computer data moves from a web server (which stores the website you're looking at and "serves" it up to you) to your web browser (the program, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, or whatever you use to surf the Web). There is no easy way for a web browser to remember things about you as you move from page to page, which makes life difficult if you want to do something like putting a product in a shopping cart (trolley), select a particular size of text for the pages you're looking at, sign in to a website for a personalized experience, and so on.

?

That's where cookies come in. Cookies are small files that websites can store on your computer to help them remember things about you. Some cookies (known as session cookies) stay on your computer only for short periods of time; others, known as persistent cookies, may stay there for years. Some cookies, known as first-party cookies, are set by the websites you visit; others are set by services that those websites rely on (for example, advertisements, statistical tracking programs, social networking widgets and so on)—and they're known as third-party cookies. Cookies like this can be used to track a web user's progress as they move from one website to another, although they generally do so anonymously (they don't usually contain personally indentifiable information). Nevertheless, the use of cookies does raise understandable concerns about privacy. If you are worried about this, you can set up your web browser to accept or reject certain kinds of cookies and you can inspect or delete the cookies it contains at any time. We explain how to do this below.

## Cookies

We do not store cookies on your computer (or have access to any cookies that may be stored there)—but our advertisers and affiliate partners may do so.

Explainthatstuff.com does not store cookies of any kind on your computer. None at all. That means we don't offer a way for you to opt-out of having your information collected or a way to remove your personal information from our records—simply because we don't collect any information about you.

Please be aware, however, that our website runs advertisements on most pages; it is a completely free website and if it didn't run advertising, it would not exist. The advertising partners we work with use what are known as third-party cookies to help them serve up relevant, targeted advertisements that they believe may match your interests. Our partners assure us that these cookies are anonymous and do not use personally identifying information to serve advertisements to you unless you have specifically given permission for that. (Although you might raise an eyebrow at this use of cookies, we believe it is better that advertisers show you advertisements you might find interesting or useful than completely random advertisements.) We have no control over these third-party cookies. We do not see or have access to any information they may store or collect. They pass directly between your computer and the servers run by our advertisers.

At the moment, Google is the only advertiser we are working with. Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies (including the DoubleClick DART cookie) to serve advertisements on our website. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). You can learn more about how Google safeguards your privacy by visiting [Google's Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacy.html) website.

## Social networking sites

Like pages on most other modern websites, most of the pages on our site now include links to social networking and bookmarking sites (including the Facebook Like button, Google +1 button, and Twitter Tweet button) to help people remember our articles and share them with their friends. Please be aware that, depending on how you are signed into these services, they might be using cookies to track websites or pages you visit. No such information is collected by our own site and none of the information that may be collected by social networking sites is available to us: it passes directly between your computer and the social networking site(s) you belong to. If you have concerns about the privacy implications of social networking bookmarks, please visit the privacy pages of the sites or services you use:

  * [Google +1 Button Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/plusone/)
  * [Twitter Privacy Policy](https://twitter.com/privacy)



## UK Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003

For users in the UK and the rest of Europe, we have carefully reviewed (and continue to review) our legal obligations under the [Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/2426/contents/made) (revised May 2011), in line with guidance from the UK [Information Commissioner's Office](http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies.aspx). We have done our best to provide clear information about privacy and cookies and to make it prominent on our website. We do not provide an option for you to consent to the use of cookies because our website does not store cookies. We are continuing to review the way our advertising and social-networking partners are responding to the changes in the privacy legislation and working with them in line with the guidance from the Information Commissioner that "The person setting the cookie is therefore primarily responsible for compliance with the requirements of the law. Where third party cookies are set through a website both parties will have a responsibility for ensuring users are clearly informed about cookies and for obtaining consent... It is therefore in both parties' interests to work together."

## Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

As explained above, this site collects and stores no personal information from anyone—and that includes children under the age of 13. We believe it is therefore fully compliant with the US [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)](http://www.coppa.org/).
