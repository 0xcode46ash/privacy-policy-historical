_Management of your information_

This Privacy Statement discloses the information privacy practices for Expedia with respect to the Expedia.co.nz web site. Expedia.co.nz is intended for use by residents of New Zealand that are over 18 years of age. 

As a visitor to Expedia.co.nz, you have the right to understand our information privacy practices prior to providing us, or our related bodies corporate, suppliers or distributors with any of your personal information. 

This document sets out Expedia’s policy concerning the management of personal information and describes the types of personal information Expedia holds, the purposes for which it holds that personal information, and the ways in which Expedia collects, holds, uses and discloses that information. ****

**What information we collect from you**  
_How we collect personal information._ We may request information about you when you book or make enquires about tickets or other products and services on Expedia.co.nz; when you enter competitions or register for promotions or when you request other information. We may also collect information when we invite you to complete surveys or provide us with feedback. In general, we receive and store any information you enter on Expedia.co.nz or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and e-mail addresses, and, in some cases, billing information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date). We also may request information about your traveler preferences, including meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and ticketing options. 

_Passenger Information_. When you make travel or other arrangements for someone else through Expedia.co.nz, we will request personal information and travel preferences about that individual. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing Expedia.co.nz with their personal information and travel preferences, as any access to view or change their travel arrangements will be available only through your account. By providing such information you warrant that the other individual(s) has authorised collection of the information from you. 

_Information from Other Sources_. To the extent permitted by law, we also may periodically obtain information about you from our business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, which we use to correct our records and to facilitate proper delivery of travel information; and demographic information, which we use to better understand your potential purchasing preferences. 

_Automatic Information_. We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit Expedia.co.nz. For example, we will collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), and referring Web site. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as trips viewed and purchases made. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help customize your user experience. 

_Cookies and Other Web Technologies_. When you visit Expedia.co.nz, we may assign your computer a "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file). For example, whenever you sign in as an member, we record your member ID and the name on your member account in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in." Note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes. You can always choose not to receive a cookie file by enabling your Web browser to refuse cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies from Expedia.co.nz, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered by Expedia.co.nz. __

_Information Collected by Third-Party Advertising Companies_. Third-party advertisers, such as those we use to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet, may use cookies and other technologies (such as Web beacons or single-pixel GIFS) for several purposes, including: to measure the effectiveness of their ads; to analyze, modify, and personalize advertising content on Expedia.co.nz and other sites; and to provide ads about goods and services we hope will be of interest to you. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers are not covered by this Privacy Policy. 

_Failure to provide information_ __. When making travel plans or a purchase using Expedia.co.nz you must provide the requested contact information and financial information. If you do not provide the requested information we may not be able to complete your requests or orders and you may not be able to access all areas of Expedia.co.nz.

**How we use your information**

We also use information about you for the following related purposes: to provide you with the products and services you request; to provide you with travel confirmation and updates; to manage your account, including processing bills and providing travel notifications; to communicate with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; __ to measure interest in and improve our products, services, and web site; to notify you about special offers and products or services that may be of interest to you; __ to otherwise customize your experience with Expedia.co.nz; _t_ o reward you as part of any reward and recognition program you choose to join; to solicit information from you, including through surveys; __ to resolve disputes, collect fees, or troubleshoot problems; to prevent and/or identify potentially prohibited or illegal activities such as fraud; regulatory reporting and compliance; __ to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection. 

When you register as a member on Expedia.co.nz, you will be given a choice as to whether you want to receive e-mail messages from Expedia.co.nz about special offers. As a registered Expedia.co.nz member, you can modify your choice at any time on the [My Account](http://www.expedia.co.nz/pub/agent.dll?qscr=info) page under the heading "E-mail settings." Whether registered as an Expedia.co.nz member or not, you also will be given the opportunity to unsubscribe from commercial messages in any such e-mail we send.

**With whom we share your information**  
We may disclose information about you as permitted by law. We may share information with regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials, provide information to protect against fraud and share information with your consent.

Expedia.co.nz primarily acts in the capacity of a travel facilitator and accordingly is obliged to disclose your personal information to other companies involved in providing you travel or related services and facilities. Under these circumstances other companies may receive personal information but are legally bound to safeguard this information and not use it for any other purposes, although Expedia.co.nz is not responsible for ensuring this.

Expedia.co.nz may share your information with the following entities: 

§               _Suppliers_ , such as hotel, airline, cruise, or car rental companies, or activity providers, who fulfill your travel reservations. Throughout Expedia.co.nz, all services provided by a third-party supplier are described as such. We may not place limitations on our suppliers' use or disclosure of your personal information. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel supplier whose products you purchase through Expedia.co.nz. Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you or to facilitate your travel reservation. 

§               _Third-party vendors_ who provide services or functions on our behalf, including credit card processing, business analytics, customer service, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention. These companies have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose. 

§               _Business partners_ with whom we may jointly offer products or services. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear with ours. If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners and recommend you evaluate their practices before deciding to provide your personal information. 

§               _Companies within the Expedia family_. Sharing this information with our U.S. corporate affiliates, including Hotels.com, TripAdvisor, Hotwire, and Classic Vacations, as well as international corporate affiliates such as Expedia.uk and Expedia.de, enables us to provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and other, which might interest you. To the extent that our corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. They also will comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any commercial e-mail they send to choose not to receive such e-mail messages in the future. 

We also may share your information: 

§               In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. 

§               When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Expedia.co.nz, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements. 

§               In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. 

Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information. 

We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors a Web site receives or what are the most popular vacation destinations. This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest. 

_Trans_ _fer of information overseas_

At present, Expedia centralises its records of personal information for all Expedia operations, including those on Expedia.co.nz, in the United States. As a consequence Expedia may perform some of its data processing of your personal information outside New Zealand, for example in the United States. To do this, Expedia may transfer your personal information internationally to other countries including the United States. In addition, considering the nature of travel products and services, it may be necessary for us to forward personal information to relevant overseas suppliers and third party vendors.

_Our legal obligations_ __

Expedia may be required by law to disclose information you have provided in obtaining travel products or services in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary (a) to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Expedia or the site; (b) where Expedia  has reason to suspect that unlawful activity has been, is being or may be engaged in, as part of its investigation of the matter or in [reporting](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/pa1988108/s18n.html#report) its concerns to relevant persons or authorities in relation to the property of Expedia, and (c) to act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Expedia, the site or the public. 

Under U.S. Law, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (“ **CBP** ”) will receive some of your travel and reservation information, known as Passenger Name Record or PNR data, prior to arrival in, or departure from, the U.S.A.

In relation to PNR data originating from the European Union (“ **EU** ”), the CBP has issued a number of undertakings which represent a unilateral declaration on how CBP will handle and utilise such PNR data. CBP has undertaken that it uses this PNR data for the purposes of preventing and combating terrorism and other transnational serious crimes. The PNR may include information provided during the booking process or held by airlines or travel agents. The information will be retained for at least three years and six months and may be shared with other authorities. For further information about these arrangements, including measures taken by the CBP to safeguard your personal information, see: http://www.dhs.gov. 

We may also disclose your personal information to various other law enforcement agencies and governments around the world for security, customs and immigration purposes.

**How you can access your information**  
Expedia will, on request, provide you with access to the personal information we hold about you, unless there is an exception which applies under the Privacy Act 1993 (NZ). We may recover from you our reasonable costs of supplying you with access to this personal information and your request to provide access to this personal information will be dealt with in a reasonable time. If we refuse to provide you with access to the personal information, we will provide you with reasons for the refusal and inform you of any exceptions relied upon under the Information Privacy Principles.

Expedia believes that members and site visitors should have control over the collection and use of their personal information. You have access to your information in the following areas of Expedia.co.nz:

·               The My Account page on Expedia.co.nz, where you can view, update, or change your personal information. On this page, you also can change your password; elect to have an automatic password sign-in when logging on to Expedia.co.nz; add new travelers and delete existing travelers from your member profile; update or correct names, phone numbers, and emergency contacts for travelers associated with your profile; and update your travel preferences.

You can close your Expedia.co.nz account by selecting the Account Closure option. We will send you an e-mail confirming your request to close your account to the e-mail address contained in your member profile. Please note that after you close an account, you will not be able to sign in or access any of your personal information. However, you can open a new account at any time. Please also note that we may retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes as well as for recordkeeping integrity. 

In the event that you notify Expedia that certain personal information about you is not accurate, complete and up‑to‑date, Expedia shall take reasonable steps to correct the personal information so that it is accurate, complete and up‑to‑date.

**How we protect your information**  
We want you to feel confident about using Expedia.co.nz to plan and purchase your travel, so we are committed to protecting the information we collect. While no web site can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us against loss or other misuse. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information. 

**External Links**  
If any part of the Expedia.co.nz web site links you to other web sites, those web sites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. We recommend you examine the privacy statements posted on those other web sites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information. 

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**  
Expedia reserves the right to modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. If there are material changes to this statement or in how Expedia.co.nz will use your personal information, Expedia.co.nz will prominently display such changes prior to implementing the change or will notify you by sending a notice to the e-mail address you provided to us.

**How you can contact us**
