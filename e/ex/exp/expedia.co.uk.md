Privacy, Please!  
  
Because your privacy is important to us, Expedia.co.uk operates by these principles (excerpted from and part of Expedia.co.uk's " **[Terms of Use and Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/daily/service/legal.asp)** "): 

  1. We explicitly ask when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). For example, if you wish to register as a member of Expedia.co.uk, you will be asked for your name and e-mail address. We provide your Personal Information to necessary third-party service providers when you reserve or purchase travel services through the Expedia Travel Agent service on Expedia.co.uk. We also use your Personal Information to operate Expedia.co.uk and, occasionally, to inform you of new features, services, and products from Microsoft. 
  2. Expedia.co.uk may carefully select other companies to send you information. If you wish to discontinue receiving such offers either from Expedia.co.uk on behalf of suppliers or directly from Expedia.co.uk, you may opt out by indicating on the member registration page that you do not desire to obtain any promotional material. 
  3. To make sure that your Personal Information for your member registration is correct and current, you may review and update your customer information at any time in **[Member Information](https://web.archive.org/pub/agent.dll?qscr=info)**. 

If at any time you believe that Expedia has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by e-mail by writing to **[travel@uk.expedia.com](mailto:travel@uk.expedia.com)** and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to determine and correct the problem promptly. For more information about protecting your privacy, please see Need Help?
