**Expedia.co.uk Privacy Statement**  
This Expedia.co.uk Privacy Statement discloses the information privacy practices for Expedia's United Kingdom Web sites, www.expedia.co.uk and msn.expedia.co.uk ("Expedia.co.uk"). The Expedia.co.uk Web sites are intended for use by residents of the UK that are over 18 years of age.

 **Information collected about you**   
Expedia.co.uk collects personally identifiable information ("PII") about you that you specifically and voluntarily provide. PII includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, phone number, or e-mail address. Although you are required to register as a member of Expedia.co.uk in order to use selected travel planning tools, and some PII is needed in order to process and fulfill travel requests, many areas of Expedia.co.uk can be accessed without providing any PII. 

On all Expedia.co.uk pages that collect PII, we specifically describe what information is required in order to provide you with the product or service you have requested. 

At present, Expedia, Inc. centralises its records of PII for all Expedia operations, including Expedia.co.uk, in the United States. As a consequence Expedia, Inc. may perform some of its data processing of your PII outside of the United Kingdom, for example in the United States. To do this, Expedia, Inc. may transfer your PII internationally to other countries including the United States. Some of the countries may have laws that protect your PII, some may not. Expedia, Inc. will protect your PII no matter where we process or store your data by following this privacy statement.

When someone other than yourself is accompanying you on travel purchased through Expedia.co.uk, we may collect PII and travel preferences about that individual.
