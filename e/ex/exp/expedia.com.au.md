**Expedia Privacy Statement**

This Privacy Statement discloses the information privacy practices for Expedia with respect to the Expedia.com.au web site. The Expedia.com.au Web site is intended for use by residents of Australia that are over 18 years of age. 

**Information collected about you**  
Expedia collects Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") about you that you specifically and voluntarily provide. PII includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, phone number, or e-mail address. Although you are required to register as a member of Expedia in order to use selected travel planning tools, and some PII is needed in order to process and fulfill travel requests, many areas of Expedia can be accessed without providing any PII. 

On all Expedia.com.au pages that collect PII, we specifically describe what information is required in order to provide you with the product or service you have requested. 

At present, Expedia centralises its records of PII for all Expedia operations, including those on Expedia.com.au, in the United States. As a consequence Expedia may perform some of its data processing of your PII outside Australia , for example in the United States. To do this, Expedia may transfer your PII internationally to other countries including the United States. Some of the countries may have laws that protect your PII, some may not. Expedia will protect your PII no matter where we process or store your data by following this privacy statement. By becoming a member of Expedia.com.au you give your consent to this transfer of your PII.

When someone other than yourself is accompanying you on travel purchased through Expedia.com.au, we may collect PII and travel preferences about that individual. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing Expedia with their full names, contact numbers, and travel preferences, as they will be unable to directly access our systems to view or change any information you provide on their behalf (however, they may submit a written request to us to access any PII you provide to us on their behalf.)   


**Access to your information**  
We will, on request, provide you with access to the PII we hold about you, unless there is an exception which applies under the National Privacy Principles as set out in Schedule 3 to the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). We may recover from you our reasonable costs of supplying you with access to this PII and your request to provide access to this PII will be dealt with in a reasonable time. If we refuse to provide you with access to the PII, we will provide you with reasons for the refusal and inform you of any exceptions relied upon under the National Privacy Principles. 

**Travel purchase information**   
Expedia collects the billing address of the credit card that is used to purchase travel through Expedia.com.au.
