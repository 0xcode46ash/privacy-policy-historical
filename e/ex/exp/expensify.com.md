# Expensify - Privacy Policy

Last Updated: January 31st, 2016

At Expensify, Inc. ("Expensify", "we", "us", or "our" which include our group and affiliated companies), our most important asset is our relationship with our user community. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of information about our users and their organizations. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal and company information when you visit the Expensify Website <https://www.expensify.com/> ("the Site") or use the Expensify Service. 

Expensify has received TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal. 

The TRUSTe program covers our collection, use and disclosure of information we collect through our website, https://www.expensify.com/, the Expensify Service and does not cover information that may be collected through our mobile applications. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Corporate Member has engaged Expensify. 

In this privacy policy, "you" and "your" refers to individual users of the Expensify Service, and "Expensify Service", "Member", "Corporate Member", "Application" and other capitalised terms not defined in this privacy policy are defined in the Expensify Terms of Service currently located at https://www.expensify.com/terms. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at [help@expensify.com](mailto:help@expensify.com).

### Important – Transfer of Data to the US of European personal information

Information that our European users submit through the Expensify Service or the Site is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United States of America and may be transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the third parties (such as our Partner Companies), who may be situated in the United States of America or elsewhere outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA. The US and other non-EEA countries do not have similar data protection laws to the European Union, and you should be aware in particular that the law and practice in the United States in respect of law enforcement authority access to data is significantly different from Europe. Where we transfer your information we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected consistent with our obligations under local law. By submitting information via the Site, you agree to this storing, processing and/or transfer. 

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and considered a part of, the Expensify Terms of Service, currently located at https://www.expensify.com/terms. Any terms not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Service.

Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 



Some of the Identifiers used by the Site are set or accessed (as appropriate) by us, and some a by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf.
