 **Registration, Surveys And Promotions**

* * *

Express.com uses registration forms to send users information about our company. Registration forms require users to give us contact information, like names and email addresses, as well as identifiers, like IDs and passwords. This contact information is used to facilitate order processing for future purchases, as well as to contact users about release updates, specials and promotions. Upon registration, users are presented with a survey in which demographic and profile data, like age and income level, is collected. Users will then receive a twice-monthly email update, containing news and information about our promotions and sales. Survey data is used to tailor our users' experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. Individual user information is never disclosed to third parties and is shared with advertisers only on an aggregate basis. Promotions require users to go through the registration process. In addition to how registration data is used above, promotions use this data to contact winners of the promotion. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt out section below. **Order Forms**
