**Log File Information**   
We collect and store the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet (e.g. aol.com); the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, and to help us make our site more useful.

**Use of Cookies**   
"Cookies" are used on www.exploreminnesota.com for several reasons related to providing high-quality information and features for our users. By providing a simple method of defining "user sessions," cookies improve the speed and efficiency of our search tools for lodging, attractions and events. Additionally, the use of cookies facilitates the My Trip Planner feature, which allows users to build personal trip itineraries they can save, print, and email to friends and family.

**Ordering Publications  
** When you provide your name, address and other personal information through our [publications order form](https://web.archive.org/web/20051216211956id_/http%3A//Order_Publications.html), we use the information in order to provide the requested publications. If and only if you explicitly grant us permission, we do sometimes release this information to Minnesota travel-related businesses. If you do not grant such permission, then your information will not be shared with any third-party organizations.

**Email Newsletters**   
We offer several free travel information [email newsletters](https://web.archive.org/web/20051216211956id_/http%3A//E-mail_Newsletter.html). We do not share email address with other businesses or organizations, though future newsletters may include messages or advertisements from Minnesota travel businesses or organizations. There are two ways you may be subscribed to one or more of our newsletters: 1) you explicitly asked to be subscribed to a newsletter; or 2) you gave us your email address when requesting travel information in the past, and told us you would like to receive travel information in the future. Subscribing to any of our email newsletters requires positive confirmation from you by email, and options for unsubscribing from a newsletter are provided at the bottom of each newsletter.
