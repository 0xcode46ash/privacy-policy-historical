# Privacy Policy @ ExplorOz Articles

## Go to top Introduction

ExplorOz ("ExplorOz") is a registered business and product of I.T. Beyond Pty Ltd. ("I.T. Beyond") As the operator of [Australia](https://web.archive.org/States/Default.aspx)'s leading 4WD resource, ExplorOz delivers content drawn from I.T. Beyond's research and related resources. 

This statement sets out the ExplorOz policies relating to the collection and use of your personal information. It applies to your conduct on the ExplorOz web site (the "Site"). These policies are in addition to the ExplorOz general [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/TermsofUse.aspx) governing the Site and should be read in conjunction with such [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/TermsofUse.aspx).

Please note that separate privacy policies apply to the use of sites that are available through the Site but are not operated by ExplorOz directly ("third party sites"). Before disclosing your personal information to any third party site you should read the relevant policy or [terms of use](https://web.archive.org/TermsofUse.aspx). 

  


## Go to top 1\. Your personal information is important to us

ExplorOz recognises that your privacy is very important to you and that you have a right to control your personal information. We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. Unless you give us explicit consent to act otherwise, the following policy will govern how ExplorOz handles your personal information and safeguards your privacy. ExplorOz is committed to protecting your personal information and giving you choice in who can use your personal information and how it can be used. We believe that our [privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/Privacy.aspx) not only complies with relevant laws but represents industry best practice.  


  


## Go to top 2\. ExplorOz Visitor & Membership systems

ExplorOz utilises a system of user registration (free service) and [Membership](https://web.archive.org/Membership/Default.aspx) (annual subscription fee) with various features that are designed to offer a more rewarding and personalised online experience. However, in order to protect these Site features from unscrupulous attack by software programs, we restrict the non-registered user from accessing these Site features.

To obtain the full benefits of Site use, users are required to register with ExplorOz by providing their email address and then using the site whilst logged on using this email account each time they visit the Site. If you do not view the site with your profile then you cannot access the restricted areas of the site and cannot use the interactive features of the site that enable you to add content (publish) to the Site. The Site however, contains many active pages of content and features that can be viewed in "read-only" mode if you do not register or do not login. 

The [Membership](https://web.archive.org/Membership/Default.aspx) system provides enhanced viewing facilities, access to Member-only services and tools in addition to the free services accessible by all registered users. 

You can learn more about enhancing your online experience through [Membership](https://web.archive.org/Membership/Default.aspx) by [clicking here](http://www.exploroz.com/Membership/About.aspx). 

  


## Go to top 3\. Collecting personal information about you

There are two main ways we collect information about you: 

### i. If you do not log in to ExplorOz using a registered profile

Whenever you visit our site, our servers automatically record information about your usage of the Site such as the time of the visit, its duration and the pages which you visit. This is intended to help us to understand what parts of our Site our users enjoy the most, and to help us to ensure that any advertising is most directly relevant to your interests. The information we collect about you remains anonymous, and we do not link it to any other personal information. 

If you do not want us to retain any information at all, even in an anonymous form, you can use the Preferences on your browser program to remove all cookies and set the browser not to accept cookies in the future. For more information on disabling cookies, [click here](http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm). 

### ii. If you log in to ExplorOz using a registered profile

Once you have registered, you have provided your email address to us. We require the use of your email account in order to verify that your visits to the Site are from a verified individual rather than a spam account or software program. This allows us to open a level of Site access that allows you to utilise the interactive sections on the Site where you may add content (publish) to the Site.

When you first register we collect information from you directly and also from time to time thereafter if you provide us additional information. 

Once you have logged on using a registered profile, we keep a record of how you use the Site. This helps us to build a profile of your site activity so that we can personalise your experience of the Site and publish information in your My Home and Profile which tracks what Site changes have occured since your last visit, and to tag relevant updates you have made back to your Profile. 

Any further collection of your personal information other than that explained above will only occur with consent from you. ExplorOz only collects information from your use of our Site. We do not collect information about you from other organizations or from websites outside the Site that you may visit.

  


## Go to top 4\. Preserving your privacy

We understand that most internet users are concerned about their privacy, want to keep control of their personal information, and may not trust the web sites which they visit. In fact, research shows around a third of internet users give false information online rather than saying who they really are. 

ExplorOz understands that even with our [privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/Privacy.aspx), some people still will not feel comfortable disclosing their personal information in order to register or even to join as a Member. We have accounted for this in the way you may setup your alias/screen name. This way, you choose your own alias, which might be "Mickey Mouse" or "Blinky Bill" and that's what we will call you in all our correspondence and that is what the site will show to others when use the interactive features. We won't know who you really are, but we will still be able to track your use of the Site and therefore give you the most enjoyable and customised experience of the Site possible. We never disclose information to any person or organisation (either online or if requested by phone or email) that identifies you as an individual (such as your name or your email address), however you may choose to add this information to your public profile (if you are a Member).

  


## Go to top 5\. Our use of cookies

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies. However, if you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies (for more information on disabling cookies, [click here](http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm). In some instances this may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of parts of the Site. For instance, you may not be able to login. 

The use of cookies can enhance your enjoyment of what is offered by ExplorOz, because they can help personalise your experience of our website. They can make it easier for you to [shop](https://web.archive.org/Shop/Default.aspx) online and can ensure that information provided to you is most relevant to your interests. Cookies can provide us with aggregated information on how people use our websites, and which advertisements are effective, which helps us to keep improving our Site. We also use cookies to operate the Visitor & [Membership](https://web.archive.org/Membership/Default.aspx) systems, as they help us to identify visitors to the site who have previously registered. 

Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's browser. The cookies simply contain a unique identifier which help us to know what our customers find interesting and useful on our website, almost like a continuing questionnaire.
