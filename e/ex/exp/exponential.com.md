    * What kind of information, including any personally identifiable information, is collected from you;
    * Who collects the information;
    * How the information is used;
    * With whom the information may be shared;
    * What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; 
    * The security procedures that are in place to protect the information; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.  




**Information We Collect  
**_Non-Personally Identifiable Information._ Non-personally identifiable information is information that, by itself, cannot be tracked to a specific individual.  Exponential® may collect non-personally identifiable information while you are visiting an Exponential® Web site or the Web site of one of Exponential's® business customers, including advertisers, Web publishers, educational institutions, or financial service providers (collectively "Business Customers").  While providing services, Exponential® may collect Web surfing data such as Web surfers' IP addresses, Web pages that have been visited, time and date, and whether or not a Web surfer clicked on various advertisements ("Web Surfing Data").

We use different types of technologies to collect this information, including cookies, action tags, Web beacons and single pixel GIFs.

If your browser is configured to accept the cookies, these cookies will be used to recognize your computer when you revisit a Web site, in order to provide you with a superior Web surfing experience, for example, by allowing us to learn how you use the Web sites and to show you advertisements we think you would want to see.   However, if you wish, you can configure your browser to block cookies.

Exponential® may place advertisements of third-party advertisers on Web sites that you are visiting.  If you choose to click on an advertisement, Exponential® may provide non-personally identifiable information to the advertiser and Web publisher.  Also, the Web publisher or Exponential's® other Business Customers may use cookies, action tags, GIFs, or Web beacons to collect information when you are visiting their Web sites.  The information they collect is governed by their individual privacy policies, not Exponential's.

_Personally Identifiable Information._  When using services offered through Exponential® or its Business Customers, you may choose to enter your name, contact information, and other personal information such as education level, gender, address, home value, credit and bankruptcy status.  You will have clear notification that we are collecting this information so that you can choose not to provide it.

Users may also provide contact information while visiting exponential.com to request information or apply for a job at Exponential™.

Business Customers may provide to Exponential® personally identifiable information that is necessary to conduct business, such as the Business Customers' credit card numbers and bank account information.

**Use of the Information We Collect  
**_Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information._ Exponential® may use non-personally identifiable information collected to improve the quality of Exponential's® services, for example, by increasing ad placements on Web sites that are receiving more Web traffic and presenting you with ads that we think you would be interested in seeing.

Exponential® may market its services by sharing Web Surfing Data with Business Customers in such a way that you are not identified. Exponential® also may provide your non-personally identifiable information to companies so that they can perform services for us.

_Use of Personally Identifiable Information._ Exponential® does not provide personally identifiable information to Business Customers or other third parties except under the following conditions.  If you provide personally identifiable information as part of an inquiry about products or services provided by one of our Business Customers, we will provide that information only to that Business Customer so that they may attempt to provide you with information regarding the products or services you inquired about.

Exponential® may use the personally identifiable information provided by users or Business Customers at exponential.com for internal purposes, such as sales, human resources, marketing, and administration ( _e.g_., billing and communicating with our Business Customers and maintaining their account information).  We may share this information with third parties who provide Exponential® with administrative services.  If Exponential® shares any of the information collected from you with a third party, their use of that information will be governed by the third party's privacy policy.

**Other Sharing of Information  
**Exponential® may release information when necessary to comply with the law or a court order.  Exponential™ also may release information to law enforcement to protect its rights, property, or other interests, including those of its customers or users or to prevent illegal activities or violations of Exponential's Terms of Use Agreement.

In the event that Exponential®, in whole or in part, is acquired by, or merged with, another company, collected information may be transferred to the acquiring or merging company. 

**Use Opt-Out Procedure  
**If you do not want to receive cookies from Exponential®, be sure to disable cookies in your browser.

  **Email Newsletters  
**Exponential® provides free e-mail newsletters to those who sign up for them. These newsletters are sent only to people who have chosen to receive them, and can be opted-out of at any time. Exponential® does not sell its e-mail lists to third parties. Each newsletter has your e-mail address stamped on it with simple instructions on how to unsubscribe that address from our newsletter list.

**Child Protection  
**Exponential® does not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 18.  In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, any information we receive from people we believe to be minors will be purged from our database. 

**European Union  
**The European Union privacy laws differ significantly from U.S. laws. To reconcile these differences, the U.S. and the European Union have created a set of guidelines called a "Safe Harbor" that define mutually acceptable privacy procedures.  Exponential® adheres to the Safe Harbor principals.  For more information go to [www.export.gov/safeharbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor).

**Security  
**Exponential® makes significant efforts to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the collected information.  These measures may include the use of secure server technology.  Any information we collect is treated as confidential information, except for the uses described above.  Collected information is not generally available to the public. Be aware, however, that the Internet is not 100% secure.  Therefore, we cannot ensure the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure.
