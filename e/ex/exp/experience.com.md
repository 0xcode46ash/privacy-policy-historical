[Home](https://web.archive.org/index.jsp): [About Us](https://web.archive.org/tools/aboutus.jsp): Privacy Policy  ** Privacy Policy  ** At Experience, we value your privacy. Experience does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when such individuals specifically provide information on a voluntary basis. We do not otherwise track or monitor users of the Web Site. The very nature of the service Experience provides requires that we gather, process, use, store and distribute information about you with which you have provided us (e.g. name, address, academic history, e-mail address, resume and its contents) as well as information regarding how you use the system. The information you give us will be used for the purpose stated when collected or to communicate with you with regard to your use of the Web Site and its services. Experience reserves the right to provide third-parties with aggregated, anonymous data about users of the Web Site and their information but, in no event, will Experience sell or distribute personally identifiable information about its users to any third party. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/). 

We will make every reasonable effort to ensure the privacy of your resume and the other information you provide to us. Please be advised that we may not always be able to control, and therefore cannot be liable for, the disclosure, distribution, transmission or posting of, or failure to disclose, distribute, transmit or post, a resume or other information by any third parties, including employers. Therefore, we recommend that users should, in every case, take care not to submit or post any information which they would not want disclosed to others. Experience cannot be responsible for the use or misuse of information posted to the Web Site by users or third-parties, including employers. 

If at any point you have submitted information and would like us to remove it from our database or take it down for correction from the Web Site, please contact us at the e-mail address or phone number listed below and we will make commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate your request within 48 hours and to forward your request to up to five users specified by you. However, we cannot control, or be liable for, such efforts, or for any past, present or future action or inaction by any of our users. 

As Experience expands the range of options and services available from our Web Site, the collection and use of personal data will also change to serve you better. We therefore reserve the specific right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time and will post notice of such changes to the Web Site. 

**Choice of Law and Forum; Severability; Entire Agreement; No Modifications** The Terms of Service are governed by the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without respect to its conflict of law principles. Jurisdiction for any claim arising under the Terms of Service shall lie exclusively with the state or federal courts sitting in Boston, Massachusetts. If any provision of the Terms of Service is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. Except as expressly otherwise provided, the Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you, the user, and Experience with respect to the use of the Web Site. No changes to these Terms of Service shall be made except by a revised posting on the Web Site.
