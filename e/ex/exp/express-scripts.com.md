The policies below apply to Express Scripts and other sites on the World Wide Web owned and operated by Express Scripts. 

**General**  
Express Scripts respects the privacy of every individual who visits our Web sites or sends us email. This Privacy Statement outlines the information Express Scripts will collect and how we will use that information. This Statement will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your personal information collected or shared when you visit Express Scripts Web sites or send us email. 

**Personally-Identifiable Information**  
Express Scripts will not collect any personally-identifiable information about you (that is, your name, address, telephone number, or email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily. 

If you do not want your personally-identifiable information collected, please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted this information and would like for us to remove it from our records, please contact us at the email address listed at the bottom of this Statement. We will use reasonable efforts to delete your information from our existing files. 

When you do provide us with personally-identifiable information, we may use that information in the following ways, unless stated otherwise: we may use that information to contact you with new promotions and announcements if you have previously provided your permission and if the promotions and announcements are in your interest. 

Express Scripts will not sell personally-identifiable information to third parties, unless stated at the time of collection. 

**Children**  
Express Scripts has no intention of collecting any personally-identifiable information (that is, name, address, telephone number, or email address) from individuals under 18 years of age. Where appropriate, Express Scripts will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on our Web sites or advertisements without consent of a parent or guardian. If a child has provided us with personally-identifiable information without the consent of a parent or guardian, a parent or guardian of that child should contact us at the email address listed at the bottom of this Statement if they would like this information deleted from our records. We will use reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our existing files. 

**Non-Personally-Identifiable Information Collected Automatically**  
In some cases, we may collect information about you that is not personally-identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet Browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the Web site and/or Internet Service Provider from which you linked to our site or advertisement. 

Similar to personally identifiable information, we will not sell non-personally-identifiable information to third parties. 

**Use of Cookies**  
When you view one of our Web sites, we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "Cookie" or similar file and will be used to determine ways to improve our Web sites, advertisements, products or services. With most Internet Browsers, you can erase Cookies from your computer hard drive, block all Cookies, or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored. Please refer to your Browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. 

**Declining Email Offers**  
As outlined in Section III of this Statement, we will only send email promotions or announcements to you if you have previously provided your permission for us to do so. Although many customers tell us they appreciate receiving notice of these carefully designed promotions and announcements, we recognize the importance of providing you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by simply replying to the email and informing us of your preferences. All email offers that you receive from Express Scripts will inform you of how to decline receiving further  
e mail offers.
