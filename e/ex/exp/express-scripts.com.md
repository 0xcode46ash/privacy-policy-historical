# Express Scripts, Inc.

Express Scripts is firmly committed to protecting the confidentiality of your personal and medical information. When you enroll in an Express Scripts service, we ask for only the information required to meet your needs. Please understand that, when enrolling in a service, you are providing information on a voluntary basis. We have developed the following practices and policies to safeguard your information. 

**Your Non-Personal Information**   
When you visit an Express Scripts Web site, we may collect non-personal information from you, such as the Internet browser or computer operating system you are using. We use this information only to provide you with better service connections and improved Web sites. We will not sell or disclose non-personal information to other companies or organizations. 

**Your Personal Information**   
When you register for an Express Scripts service or make service elections (such as choosing a prescription benefit package under your plan), you may voluntarily provide us with personal information, such as your name and e-mail address. When personal information is combined with health or medical status information, we refer to it as "health-related personal information." 

Unless otherwise stated at the time of collection, Express Scripts will not sell or disclose your personal or health-related personal information to other companies or organizations. 

Express Scripts will use your personal and health-related personal information for only the following purposes. 

  * We will manage your prescription benefits and process your prescription drug claims. This process may involve sharing certain information with you or your doctor, pharmacist, health plan or plan administrator. These disclosures are made in full accordance with the terms of your health plan or prescription benefit plan. 
  * We will process and send you orders you have placed through Express Scripts Mail Service Pharmacy. 
  * At your request, we may send you information regarding health conditions, medicines, or promotional offers. 
  * At the request of you or your health plan, we may send you information or contact you regarding programs designed to improve your health. 



Express Scripts also reserves the right to use your personal or health-related personal information to generate aggregate data (summarized data that does not identify you) for the following purposes: 

  * Express Scripts is always seeking better ways to serve you. We may perform statistical analyses of the traffic patterns, site usage and behaviors associated with our Web sites. We may use these analyses to generate aggregate data which we may sell or disclose to other companies or organizations. 
  * Express Scripts analyzes utilization information in the aggregate to study outcomes, costs, and provider profiles, and to suggest benefit designs for your employer or health plan. These studies generate aggregate data which we may sell or disclose to other companies or organizations. 



In certain circumstances, Express Scripts may be legally compelled to release your personal or health-related personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law or regulation. Under these circumstances, we will notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order. 

**Family Member Information**   
By using the Express Scripts Prescription Drug Benefits Planner, subscribers can view the prescription history for all covered household members under the age of 18. When registering for this service, subscribers can also elect to view the prescription history for any adult dependents in the household. 

To view prescription history information for adult dependents, the subscriber must certify (at the time of registration) that permission has been obtained from the affected dependents. The subscriber also must agree to use the dependents' prescription history solely for the purposes of prescription benefit management. Prescription history cannot be used for any other purposes without the written consent of the adult dependents. 

**Correct/Update Your Information**   
You can correct or update your personal or health-related personal information at any time using the following options:

**Sale or Transfer of Information in the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy**   
Express Scripts considers the information obtained through its Web sites to be significant assets of Express Scripts. As a result, in the event Express Scripts is acquired, merges with another entity, becomes insolvent and/or declares bankruptcy, the Web sites, and any information obtained through them, may be transferred or sold to another entity, in accordance with applicable law. 

**E-mail Privacy**   
You can choose to receive e-mail from Express Scripts on selected health topics and promotions. Each e-mail message we send you includes instructions for discontinuing the receipt of such messages in the future. 

If you are receiving e-mail correspondence at an employer's e-mail address, please note that, under law, the employer may be permitted to view the contents of any e-mail messages received at this address. If you are concerned about the confidentiality of your e-mail messages, you may wish to use a home e-mail address. 

**Usage by Children**   
Express Scripts' Web sites are neither intended nor designed to attract users who are minor children. 

Furthermore, Express Scripts has no intention of collecting personal information from minor children. Where appropriate, we specifically instruct minor children not to submit such information without the consent of a parent or guardian. 

To request the removal of personal information submitted by a minor child, please send an e-mail to [questions@express-scripts.com](mailto:questions@express-scripts.com). We will make all reasonable efforts to remove the information. 

**Cookies**   
When you view one of our Web sites, we may store information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file and will be used to determine ways to improve our Web sites, advertisements, products or services. With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser's instructions or online help files to learn more about these functions. 

**Links to Other Sites**   
Express Scripts' Web sites may include links to other sites that are not related to, or are not the property of, Express Scripts. We are not responsible for the dependability or information security of these other sites, and the policies in our Security/Privacy Statement pertain only to Express Scripts' Web sites. 

**Security Measures**   
To ensure the security of your personal and health-related personal information, Express Scripts' Web sites support Web browsers that use 128-bit encryption. While such browsers are not required to use Express Scripts' Web sites, we strongly recommend their usage when viewing or entering information. 

In addition, Express Scripts' Web sites use a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. As an added security precaution, all personal and health-related personal information is kept on a physically separate server with firewalls that meet or exceed industry standards to prevent intruders from gaining access. 

**Safe Shopping**   
Express Scripts' Web sites use Secure Socket Layers (SSL) to ensure the confidentiality of your credit card information. As your order is transmitted to us, SSL technology prevents other parties from viewing or obtaining your credit card information. 

After receiving your order, we separate your credit card information from the rest of your order data. We then store your credit card information on a separate server that is not accessible from the Internet. This prevents external parties, as well as unauthorized internal personnel, from viewing your information. 

**Changes in Our Privacy Policy**   
Express Scripts uses your personal and health-related personal information only as described in the privacy policy when the information is collected from you. However, subject to the terms below, we reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy/Disclosure Policy at any time. Changes to the Privacy/Disclosure Policy will be posted on this site. 

Announcements of policy changes will include any applicable instructions for rejecting the additional use, disclosure, or sale of your information. 

**How to Send Us Your Comments**   
We welcome your comments. If you have general feedback regarding our Privacy/Disclosure Policy, please send an e-mail to [feedback@express-scripts.com](mailto:feedback@express-scripts.com).

Specific questions regarding the enforcement of this policy should be directed to Express Scripts' Chief Compliance Officer at 1-800-332-5455, extension 67112.
