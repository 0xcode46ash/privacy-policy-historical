# Privacy Policy for Experts Exchange

Use of IP Address
     EXPERTS-EXCHANGE uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. We may also use an IP address for other uses including, but not limited to, directing you to a geographically closer data center, providing you a registration page in your country's local currency, and other uses. 
Use of Cookies
     EXPERTS-EXCHANGE uses cookies to keep track of your member session. We use cookies to save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. We may use cookies to gather other information in order to enhance your experience using EXPERTS-EXCHANGE, and we will not resell or share any information gathered with our cookies to a third party. 
Registration
     EXPERTS-EXCHANGE's site registration form requires members to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). The member's contact information is also used to contact the member when necessary. Members may opt-out of receiving future mailings, such as the EXPERTS-EXCHANGE newsletter, by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of such mailings. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data for developing marketing programs. In addition, we use this data to tailor the member's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. 

The data that you provide for Experts Exchange, LLC is collected from the [www.experts-exchange.com](http://www.experts-exchange.com/) web site and from Experts Exchange, LLC 

Partners and Links
     In order to grow our site, we form relationships with partners to promote EXPERTS-EXCHANGE and encourage new members to join our Network. One form of these relationships is a co-branded Website which combines the partner's look-and-feel with our topic areas and content. These co-branded pages allow us to keep the member information and content hosted on our secure servers. Each new member must accept our terms and conditions, including this privacy statement. Because some partners are helping us grow our Network by promoting the EXPERTS-EXCHANGE name and co-branded page, we sometimes share information about the members that sign up through the partner's co-branded page. In all cases, our partners commit to honoring our privacy policy. 

This site contains links to other sites. EXPERTS-EXCHANGE is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

Surveys
     Our online surveys ask members for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send the member information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The member's contact information is also used to contact the member when necessary. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our member's experience at our site, providing them with services or showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. Also, we use this data for developing marketing programs. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. 
Contests
     We run contests on our site in which we ask members for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). The member's contact information is also used to contact the member when necessary. If the member is a contest winner, we will send the member an email to notify them of their winnings. To retrieve their winnings, members may respond to the following email address, [prizes@experts-exchange.com](mailto:prizes@experts-exchange.com). We offer contests that may require certain personally identifiable information. Because the rules and terms of each promotion vary, all information about the contest is posted during the event in the Terms and Conditions. 
Tell a Friend
     If a member elects to use our referral service for informing a friend of our site, we ask them for their friend's name and email address. EXPERTS-EXCHANGE will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. EXPERTS-EXCHANGE will not resell or share this information with any third party. 
Third Party Advertiser
     EXPERTS-EXCHANGE works with a third party to serve ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. This policy only covers the use of cookies by EXPERTS-EXCHANGE and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. EXPERTS-EXCHANGE does not have control, nor access to the information contained in its advertisers' cookies. 
Public Forums
     EXPERTS-EXCHANGE provides a question and answer forum to its members. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

Choice/Opt-Out

Choice/Opt-In
     Members may opt-in to receive information from EXPERTS-EXCHANGE regarding products or services that are considered of value by us, and this is accomplished by selecting to receive our email newsletter on your Edit Member Profile page. 

The type of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under EXPERTS-EXCHANGE's control are as follows: 
    

EXPERTS-EXCHANGE operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers. Even your registration account password is encrypted before it is sent to our computers - no one in the company could tell you what your password is, even if you asked. Any other particularly sensitive information, such as a member's credit card number collected for a commerce transaction, is also encrypted prior to transmission. 

You, the consumer, are ultimately responsible for the security of your EXPERTS-EXCHANGE login name and password. As we explained, we cannot even use your password unless it has been encrypted first. Please take care to store your EXPERTS-EXCHANGE login name separately from your account password, or better yet, choose a password that you don't need to write down at all. 

Correct/Update
     You may change your information by updating your profile on the "Edit Member Profile" page. After you have made changes to your account, make sure to click the "Submit" button on the bottom of the page. 

The EXPERTS-EXCHANGE Privacy Policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the web site. We will post these changes so that you will always know what information we gather, how we may use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Please check this site for information about revisions to our privacy policy. 

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with EXPERTS-EXCHANGE, please contact:
