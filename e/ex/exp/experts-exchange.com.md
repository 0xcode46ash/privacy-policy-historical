Partners and Links  
  
In order to grow our site, we form relationships with partners to promote Experts Exchange and encourage new members to join our network. Typically, these relationships consist of a co-branded page which combines the partner's look-and-feel with our topic areas and content. These co-branded pages allow us to keep the member information and content hosted on our secure servers. Each new member must accept our terms and conditions, including this privacy statement. Because some partners are helping us grow our network by promoting the Experts Exchange name and co-branded page, we sometimes share information of the members that sign up through the partner's co-branded page. In all cases, our partners commit to honoring our privacy policy.
