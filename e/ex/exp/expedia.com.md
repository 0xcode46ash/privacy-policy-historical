**Information collected about you**  
Expedia.com collects personally identifiable information ("PII") about you that you specifically and voluntarily provide. PII includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, phone number, or e-mail address. Although you are required to register as a member of Expedia.com in order to use selected travel planning tools, and some PII is needed in order to process and fulfill travel requests, many areas of Expedia.com can be accessed without providing any PII. 

On all Expedia.com pages that collect PII, we specifically describe what information is required in order to provide you with the product or service you have requested. 

Expedia.com collects PII when you: 

  * Become an Expedia.com member

This information is stored in the [My Profile](https://web.archive.org/pub/agent.dll?qscr=info) area of a member's Expedia.com account. 

When someone other than yourself is accompanying you on travel purchased through Expedia.com, we may collect PII and travel preferences about that individual. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing Expedia.com with their full names, contact numbers, and travel preferences, as they will be unable to directly access our systems to view or change any information you provide on their behalf. 

**Travel purchase information**   
Expedia.com collects the billing address of the credit card that is used to purchase travel. We will also collect credit card information, including card number, card type, cardholder name, and expiration date, in order to bill you for travel purchased through Expedia.com. Please view our [Credit Card Guarantee](https://web.archive.org/daily/service/cc.asp) for additional information on Expedia.com's commitment to protecting your credit card security. 

**Travel Arranger information**   
Expedia.com offers you the ability to authorize others to make and purchase travel arrangements on your behalf and allows you to become an authorized Travel Arranger for other Expedia.com members. If you elect to participate in this service, Expedia.com will collect the e-mail address of the person you are authorizing to make travel arrangements on your behalf or for whom you are requesting authorization to make travel arrangements. 

**Surveys, contests, and sweepstakes information**   
Occasionally, Expedia.com may offer our members and site visitors an opportunity to participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes. Information collected by Expedia.com when you participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes may include your full name, e-mail address, and street address.

Expedia.com collects PII such as your full name, Member ID, e-mail address, and/or contact number whenever you submit a question or suggestion, or request assistance with viewing your itinerary, logging on to Expedia.com, or accessing your account. 

**Our partners**   
Expedia.com has partnered with reputable third parties to offer our members and site visitors a variety of products and services. All travel services throughout Expedia.com that are provided by a third-party partner are described as such. Although we only work with reputable third parties, our business partners may have different privacy policies and practices than Expedia.com. We encourage you to review our business partners' privacy policies to further understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. 

**Other information we collect**   
Some information is collected automatically every time you visit Expedia.com. Expedia.com collects information about your computer and assigns you a "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file) when you visit Expedia.com.

**Cookies and other Web technologies**   
As a member or visitor to Expedia.com you will be assigned a permanent cookie file on your computer's hard drive. You can always choose to not receive a cookie file by enabling your Web browser to refuse cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie. Be advised that, by refusing to accept a cookie, you will not be able to access many travel services and planning tools offered by Expedia.com.

Once you sign in as an Expedia.com member, we record the Member ID and the name on the member account in the cookie file on your computer. We may also record your password in this cookie file if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in." Your Member ID, password, and the name on your member account is stored in the cookie file as encrypted data, so no one can view the information it contains by obtaining unauthorized access to your computer. Permanent cookie files remain on your computer's hard drive until you manually delete the file. 

A cookie file may also be placed on your hard drive by Expedia.com's third-party advertising companies or by Microsoft, Expedia.com's Corporate Affiliate. These companies may use aggregated statistics about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about travel-related goods and services that you may be interested in. The information they collect does **not** include your PII. 

The third-party advertising companies may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of ads. This is primarily accomplished through the use of an action tag (also known as an invisible gif), which the third party places on our site to collect anonymous information. They may use this anonymous information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. **No** PII is collected during this process. The information is anonymous and does not link online actions to an identifiable person. 

**Computer information**   
Expedia.com collects certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during a visit to Expedia.com. This information is collected from your computer's Web browser and may include your IP address, operating system, Web browser software (i.e., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), screen resolution, and referrer Web site. Wireless users: Please check with your wireless company if you are using your cellular phone to access the Internet to understand whether PII may be used to identify you.

**Travel planning and purchase**

**Price Matcher™ results notification**   
Expedia.com will send you an e-mail notifying you of the results of your price bid (i.e., either your bid was successful or unsuccessful). If your price bid was successful, you will be directed to our travel purchase pages so that you may complete your travel reservations. 

**Travel Alerts notification**   
In the event your travel plans are disrupted because of mechanical, weather, or carrier business conditions, Expedia.com may send you an e-mail notification to inform you of these conditions and help you make alternative travel arrangements. 

**E-mail notifications**   
If you chose to receive communications from Expedia.com about special promotions when registering as an Expedia.com member, we may use your e-mail address to send you communications about surveys, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, flight specials, Trip Guide information, or other travel opportunities on Expedia.com and its marketing partners. If you sign up for our Fare Tracker service, your e-mail address will also be used to notify you of current fares to cities you have selected. We may use your e-mail address or telephone number to contact you about changes to your purchased travel itinerary. 

**Tell a friend program**   
Expedia.com uses a third-party partner to provide our Tell a friend program. When you participate in the Tell a friend program, our third-party partner will collect the e-mail addresses that you provide for yourself and your friends. The third-party partner will send e-mail referrals to the persons you indicated. When your friends respond to the referral and visit the Expedia.com site, a cookie is placed on their browsers to measure the effectiveness of our Web site. The information that is gathered in this manner is not shared with any third parties except on an anonymous, aggregated basis. 

**Responses to your questions or suggestions**   
We will use your e-mail address or telephone number to respond when you submit a question or suggestion, or request assistance with viewing your itinerary, logging on to Expedia.com, or accessing your account. 

**Improving the quality of your visit to our site**   
We collect information about your computer (not your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number) through your permanent cookie file for the purpose of assessing the effectiveness of site content and traffic. This data allows us to improve the quality of your visit by streamlining your ability to navigate the site and develop featured programs and content that will be of interest to our members and site visitors. 

**Sharing your information**  
**Expedia.com does not sell or rent your PII to anyone.**

**Corporate affiliates**   
If you access Expedia through msn.expedia.com, we share technical information about your computer (collected through the assigned cookie file) with Microsoft, our Corporate Affiliate. This information is used by Microsoft for the purpose of assessing the effectiveness of site content and Web traffic navigation across the MSN® network of Internet services. This is the only information Expedia shares with Microsoft and Microsoft does not have access to the PII you have provided to Expedia. 

**Service providers**   
We only provide information about travel either reserved or purchased on Expedia.com to third parties that provide services or functions on behalf of Expedia.com. Our service providers need information about your traveler profile, as well as your credit card information, to process and confirm your travel reservation. These service providers will disclose information about your traveler profile to hotel, airline, cruise, and/or car rental suppliers whose products you have purchased. Like any other travel agent, this information must be shared with our travel suppliers to confirm your reservation and travel preferences. Although Expedia.com offers travel products from hotel, airline, cruise, and car rental suppliers that are reputable companies, we have not placed limitations on these suppliers from using or disclosing your information without your permission. Therefore, we encourage you to review the information privacy practices of any travel suppliers whose products you purchase on Expedia.com. In addition, these travel suppliers may also contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about your confirmed reservation. 

Expedia.com will occasionally share aggregated information with our service providers. This information does not contain any PII and is used to develop featured programs and content that will be of interest to our members and site visitors. 

In the event that you make a new, or update an existing, travel reservation by calling our toll-free number, your information may be accessed by a third-party service provider, as necessary, to respond to your request for customer service. 

Expedia.com may contract a reputable third-party to facilitate the distribution of survey, promotion, or sweepstakes programs. Upon completion of these projects, all information is returned to Expedia.com. 

**Our legal obligations**   
Expedia.com may be required by law to disclose information you have provided in obtaining our travel products or services. Expedia.com may also disclose information against someone who poses a threat to Expedia.com's interests (such as customer fraud) or whose activities could bring harm to others. 

**Other Web sites**   
There are several places throughout Expedia.com that may link you to other Web sites that do not operate under Expedia.com's information privacy practices. When you click through to these Web sites, Expedia.com's information privacy practices no longer apply. We recommend that you examine the privacy statements for all third party Web sites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information.
