We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services.  

Users in the European Union

If you’re a user in the European Union, you should know that Expo 2020 is the controller of your personal information. Here is some additional information we would like to bring to your attention:

  * **1-** **Bases for using your information**

Your country only allows us to use your personal information when certain conditions apply. These conditions are called “legal bases” and, at Expo 2020, we typically rely on the following:

**Contract**. One reason we might use your information is that you have entered into an agreement with us. 

**Legitimate interest**. Another reason we might use your information is because we have—or a third party has—a legitimate interest in doing so. For example, we need to use your information to provide and improve our services. We might also use some information about you to try to show you ads you might find interesting. An important point to understand about legitimate interest is that our interests do not outweigh your right to privacy, so we only rely on legitimate interest when we think the way we are using your data does not significantly affect your privacy or would be expected by you, or there is a compelling reason to do so. 

**Consent**. In some cases, we will ask for consent to use your information for specific purposes. If we do, we will make sure you can revoke your consent in our services or through your device permissions. 

**Legal obligation**. We may be required to use your personal information to comply with any applicable law in the UAE, for instance when we respond to valid legal process or need to take action to protect our users. 

  * **2-** **Your right to object**

You have the right to object to our use of your information. With many types of data, we have provided you with the ability to simply delete it if you do not want us processing it anymore. For other types of data, we have given you the ability to stop the use of your data by disabling the feature altogether. If there are other types of information, you do not agree with us processing, you can contact us.

  * **3-** **International transfers**

We may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and store and process it in the United States and other countries outside of where you live. Whenever we share information of EU users outside the EU we make sure an adequate transfer mechanism is in place. 

  * **4-** **Complaints**

If you are based in the EU, you can always file a complaint with the supervisory authority in your Member State. 

  * **5-** **Children**



Our services are not intended for—and we do not direct them to—anyone under 13. In addition, that is why we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13. In addition, we may limit how we collect, use, and store some of the information of EU users between 13 and 16. In some cases, this means we will be unable to provide certain functionality to these users. If we need to rely on consent, as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent’s consent before we collect and use that information.

Revisions to the Privacy Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. However, when we do, we will let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we will let you know by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Policy that is available on our website. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites’ homepages).
