Privacy Policy

We take your privacy seriously. Explorica employs the strictest security measures to ensure the absolute privacy of every user.

 **What information does Explorica collect?** Explorica collects basic personal information, including your name, address, phone number, date of birth, email address, and credit card data. We use secure online forms and store all information in protected operating environments inaccessible to the public. 

Be advised that we cannot protect information you provide through chat sessions and email to other users you meet online. Please practice discretion when participating in those areas. 

**Why does Explorica collect this information?** We collect personal information to reserve your tour and create your online personal account. We do not disclose your personal information to anyone else, other than the hotels, airlines, and additional service providers you'll be using on your trip. We use your email address to answer your questions and to send you updates on your itinerary. 

Explorica may provide general statistics about users' travel habits to reputable third-party vendors. This information is not user-specific; your identity remains anonymous. 

**Are online credit card payments secure?** Yes. Explorica employs the most advanced encryption technology to ensure that all financial information is transmitted securely from your computer to us. 

**Does Explorica use cookies?** Like most internet sites, we use cookies (encrypted personalization technology) to temporarily store and track your preferences and provide you with a personalized experience. Cookies use an encoded session ID that is accessible only to your browser and is stored in your computer's memory. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. You can disable the cookie function on your computer, though doing so may prevent you from taking full advantage of our site's capabilities. Rest assured that cookies do not match online activity with user identity. 

**How does Explorica protect young adults' privacy?** Explorica complies with federal law and the guidelines set up by Federal Trade Commission that require web sites to post privacy policies and to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from anyone under the age of 18. 

Personal data collected from anyone under the age of 18 is used strictly to complete travel reservations and is shared only with outside vendors involved in that process. 

We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the site. 

**Your Consent** By using Explorica's site and services, you agree to the collection and use of personal information by us. We will post any policy changes as they occur so you are always informed of our process. 

We want your online experience to be safe, comfortable, and as interactive as you wish. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, contact us at any time.
