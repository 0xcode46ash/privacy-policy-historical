# Study Abroad Guide

FPP Media, Inc., holder of the site **expo -studyabroad.com**, does not divulge, pass on or sell, under any conditions, any of the information provided by the user of our site without the express consent and authorization of the user. Additionally, we guarantee you, the user, complete transparency with, and control over, the use of your individual information.

Currently, there are many ways to obtain information about users on the Internet. FPP Media, Inc. uses registration forms and questionnaires to get to know its users better. Generally, we ask about the individual's characteristics and interests, and about socio-demographic facts. This allows us to offer a unique service that is more adapted to the interest of our users.

All of the information asked for by FPP Media, Inc. is, and will always be, voluntary and every user will be able to, at any time, limit his/her answers to those that the user deems appropriate. However, by acquiring more detailed information about our users we become better able to offer a comprehensive, quality service, focused to the specific interests of our users.

We also use 'cookies' to better understand our users' navigation on the site, as well as on the Internet in general. Cookies are small information files that are saved on your computer that help us to recognize you when you revisit the pages on our site. This allows us to present information adjusted to your specific tastes and preferences. These cookies also help us to estimate the size of our audience and to better understand the characteristics of the traffic on our site.

We remind you that the user has total autonomy to refuse these cookies on his/her computer by using the blocking options available in the browser software. However, the refusal of these cookies will, again, prevent us from offering you a unique and individualized service of better quality.

Our main objective for gathering information from our site users is always to offer them a service that is more oriented to their needs, making their visit to our site more productive. This also makes our advertisers marketing more effective.

We would never give out or sell our users' personal data to any third parties without their express consent. However, we maintain the right to divulge global and generic information about any group, or subgroup, of our site user base. That is, we would not divulge an address, but perhaps the regional distribution of our site users. In the same way, we might choose to divulge the distribution between males and females, income groups, age groups, as well as other general characteristics of those that visit the site, without ever identifying them individually.

FPP Media, Inc. also guarantees its users that it will not pass on information to third parties for use in mailing lists without their express consent. Our mailing lists require authorization from our users, which is given as an option on our registration forms.

FPP Media, Inc., as a matter of policy, does not pass on the personal information of its users to third parties, except with the express consent to do so. In some special cases, such as in offers made together with business partners and other kinds of events, gathered information may be shared with promoters. However, in the process of signing up for each event, our users will be informed of how their information will be used and who will be responsible for its control.

FPP Media, Inc. also reserves the right to divulge the personal information of any user when asked for by a court of law.

Finally, we remind you that the information sent by you to any school listed on our site is transmitted to the school through the Internet as an unencrypted e-mail message. Any unencrypted message sent by e-mail may be susceptible to interception and fraud. Upon receipt by the school, FPP Media, Inc. no longer has control over the information that you supplied and, therefore, can no longer be held responsible for it.
