We need this type of information to provide the personalized services that you have requested, specifically, we need this type of information to allow one of our professional home buyers or real estate agents to contact you. We hope that, like many of our customers, you will find it beneficial to provide Personally Identifiable Information to exprealty.com so that we may provide our valuable services to you.Again, this type of information will be shared ONLY with real estate and related professionals who can assist you in a real estate transaction.
