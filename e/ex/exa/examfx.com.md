Our story began with ExamFX in 1996 when we pioneered The Exam Simulator, an industry-changing state-specific pre-licensing assessment that was first on the market to provide students with a realistic exam experience from test questions to test format... Today, we are the nation's leader in providing online pre-licensing training and assessments.
