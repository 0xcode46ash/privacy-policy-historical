**PRIVACY POLICY - COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY**

This site is owned and operated by Examiner.com. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Examiner.com, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.

**INFORMATION EXAMINER.COM GATHERS AND TRACKS**

Examiner.com gathers two types of information about users:

  * Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions required for some services on our website including posting classified ads and emailing articles to friends.  

  * Information Examiner.com gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because Examiner.com derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no circumstances does Examiner.com divulge any personally identifiable information about an individual user to a third party. Personally identifiable information (â€œPersonal Informationâ€�) includes users name, email address, physical address, telephone number(s), credit card number(s), social security number, buying preferences, income and education levels and related information. 



**Third Party Sites**

Third party sites, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Through the Examiner.com website you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, advertisements, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Examiner.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties and is not liable to you for any claims that may arise from your interaction with those third parties or their sites. You should exercise caution and check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing Personal Information or another partyâ€™s information on a feature or page operated by a third party.

**Optional Voluntary Information**

We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:

  1. "E-mail this to a friend" policy  
Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose. 
  2. Classified Advertisement Postings  
Users submitting a classified ad for publication are requested to provide Personal Information necessary to allow third parties to respond to the ad, and where required, to process payment for the listing of the ad. This Personal Information is retained by Examiner.com and to the extent necessary for response, is posted with the ad. When users submit a classified ad for publication, users agree that the advertisement as it appears on Examiner.com becomes the property of Examiner.com and users assign all ownership interest in the advertisement under copyright law or otherwise to Examiner.com. Submission of an advertisement does not constitute a commitment on the part of Examiner.com to publish the advertisement, and publication of an advertisement does not constitute an agreement from Examiner.com for continued publication. We will accept only standard and required proper punctuation in the text of all advertisements. Examiner.com reserves the right to edit, reclassify, revise, reject or cancel any advertisement at any time, in its sole discretion. Rates and specifications are subject to change. 
  3. Surveys  
Examiner.com may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic Personal Information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party. 



**Usage tracking**

Examiner.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. Examiner.com does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).

Examiner.com sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms those users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.

**Cookies**

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Examiner.com uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. Disabling cookies may result in errors while using the site 

**Third Party Advertising**

The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visit to this site, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other Personal Information), is used to deliver ads to you on this site. For more information about DoubleClick, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please [click here.](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/)

**Third Party Cookies**

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser

**Children**

Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.

**USE OF INFORMATION**

Examiner.com uses any Personal Information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users. 

Examiner.com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any Personal Information about any individual user except when we are required to do so to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

**SHARING OF THE INFORMATION**

Examiner.com uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We will not share information about individual users with any third party, except when we are required to do so to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

**SECURITY**

Examiner.com operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. Only authorized individuals have access to the Personal Information provided by our customers.

**YOUR CONSENT**

By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Information by Examiner.com. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. You are encouraged to periodically review this page to view the most current version of this policy.
