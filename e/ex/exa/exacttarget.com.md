# ExactTarget Privacy Policy

ExactTarget is committed to protecting the privacy of our web site visitors and clients. We strive to uphold the highest industry standards in online privacy and permission marketing. For more information on how ExactTarget enforces permission email marketing with our clients, please see our Anti-spam policy.

### Anti-Spam Policy

### Security and Privacy

ExactTarget's web site uses security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We store the information in a database in a secured environment at our data centers.  We do not share, sell, or rent individual personal information with anyone without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or sending you e-mails you agree to receive.

### Choice Opt-in

Our members and their subscribers are given the opportunity to 'opt-in' to having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. Users of our site will be notified if their information is being collected by any third parties. We do this to ensure that our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.

### Newsletters

You will be added to ExactTarget's email newsletter list only if you register to receive newsletters via a form or checkbox on the ExactTarget website. You may opt-out of receiving our newsletters by clicking on the opt-out link included in every email newsletter we send, or by contacting [ **privacy@exacttarget.com**](mailto:privacy@exacttarget.com) and requesting that we stop sending the newsletter.

### Refer a Friend/Forward-to-a-Friend Functionality

If you feel that information about ExactTarget could be useful for a third party you know (e.g. your friends or family members etc.), you may use our forward-to-a-friend functionality. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about ExactTarget, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. ExactTarget stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

### User-Generated Content

Some areas of ExactTarget's web site allow you to provide content to us directly (each, a Public Forum), like, for example, our blog.  If you use Public Forums on the web site, you should be aware, and you expressly agree that any personally identifiable information you submit in these Public Forums can be read, collected, or otherwise used by anyone who reads the Public Forums. We are not responsible for third-party usage of publicly-viewable personal information on the web site.

### Testimonials

We post video customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. We obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with its testimonial.

### Information Tracked

At times we will use your HTTP header information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. We also may track browser types to help us understand our visitors' needs related to our web site design.  There is an optional section of our web site where input forms require your name, phone number, company, and e-mail address. This form provides the ability to opt-in to receiving future emails of any sort from ExactTarget. If you opt-in to receiving email communications from us, then we may send information to you on our products or services.  This information will not be used for any other purpose. We do, however, reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.  You may review and change your information with us at any time by clicking on the "modify profile" link on the site or similar found at the bottom of emails sent via our system, or by contacting us at [**privacy@exacttarget.com**](mailto:privacy@exacttarget.com). To opt-out from having any provided information used for email communications from us, please click on the opt-out (unsubscribe) link in any message you receive from us. This will allow you to unsubscribe or update your message preferences. Alternately, you may contact us at [**privacy@exacttarget.com**](mailto:privacy@exacttarget.com).

### Service Providers

We utilize a third-party service provider for our online live chat functionality. 

### Web Beacons

In order to determine a user's ability to receive HTML email in addition to whether or not an email has been opened, ExactTarget includes a "web beacon" in a majority of the HTML email messages we send. A web beacon (actually a small .gif image) is activated when an HTML email is opened via a request for the image on our servers.  This capability helps ExactTarget send email in a format users can read and enables ExactTarget, and our clients that use the functionality, to track the aggregate number of emails opened. The web beacon does not collect any personally identifiable information. Users that do not want to receive email messages with web beacons can choose to receive their emails in text (non-HTML) format.  We also use, and provide our clients with, the capability to track when a URL has been clicked inside of an email message sent by our system. We use this functionality to track which links were clicked and in what quantity, as well as the aggregate number of links clicked. This click tracking functionality does not collect any personally identifiable information.

### Client-Side Tracking Objects

Client-side tracking objects (commonly cookies or JavaScript files) are small files that are placed on your computer or device by websites you visit.  Such files are used to track your experience on a website, make a website work more efficiently, enable extra functionality of a website, and provide website owners with additional information about your visit to a website.

In addition to the files described in the table below, we use client-side tracking objects to verify the login status of customers using products or services linked directly with our website. Usage of our files is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.

Additionally, as described in the table below, we generate cookies for tracking purposes through Google Analytics and Omniture. Omniture is a third party that generates cookies for us through its 2o7.net domain for tracking purposes.

### Safe Harbor Data Privacy Notice – Applicable to Persons Protected Under the Directive 95/46/EC (the EU Data Protection Directive of 1995).

ExactTarget complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  ExactTarget has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view ExactTarget's certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>

ExactTarget will respond to your request to access or delete personal information within 30 days as is required under the EU Safe Harbor program.  This notice outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the Safe Harbor Principles, including the type of information to which this notice applies, how we use personal information, and the choices individuals have regarding our use of, and their ability to correct, that personal information. If there is any conflict between the policies in this notice and the Safe Harbor Principles, the Safe Harbor Principles will govern.  This notice applies to all personal information we handle, including on-line (except as noted below), and manually processed data. For purposes of this notice, "personal information" means data that: is transferred from the European Union to the United States; is recorded in any form; and is about, or pertains to, a living individual who is identified in, or is identifiable from, the data.  "Sensitive information" is a subcategory of personal information. Sensitive information is defined as personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or the sex life of the individual. Sensitive information also includes personal information received from a third party where the third party treats and identifies it as sensitive.

### Safe Harbor Principles Regarding Personal Information Notice and Choice

We notify individuals about the personal information we collect from them, how we use it, and how to contact us with privacy concerns. We obtain personal information only as permitted by the Safe Harbor Principles or with the consent of the individual affected. Consent for personal information to be collected, used, and/or disclosed in certain ways may be required in order for an individual to obtain or use our services. To the extent permitted under the Safe Harbor, we reserve the right to process personal information in the course of providing professional services to our clients without the knowledge of individuals involved.

### Disclosures and Transfers

We do not disclose personal information to third parties, except when one or more of the following conditions is true: we have the individual's permission to make the disclosure; the disclosure is permitted by law or mandatory  under professional standards; the disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or other disposition of all or part of our business or assets; the personal information to be disclosed is publicly available; the party to whom the disclosure is made controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with ExactTarget; the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment or maintenance of legal claims; or the disclosure is to persons or entities for whom we are providing services, provided the disclosure is consistent with the purpose for which the personal information was obtained.  We will comply with the Safe Harbor Principles with respect to disclosures of sensitive information, including, when applicable, obtaining the explicit consent of the individual prior to disclosing sensitive information to a third party or using sensitive information for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.  

### Data Security, Integrity, and Access

We employ technical and organizational measures, including education and training of our personnel, designed to provide the personal information in our possession with reasonable protection from accidental loss or destruction, improper use, alteration, or disclosure. Personal information collected or displayed through a web site is protected in transit by industry standard encryption processes. However, we cannot guarantee the security of personal information accessible on or transmitted via the Internet.  We process personal information in ways compatible with the purpose for which the personal information was collected, or as otherwise authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for such purposes, we take reasonable steps to make sure that personal information is accurate, complete, current, and otherwise reliable with regard to its intended use.  If an individual becomes aware that personal information we maintain about that individual is inaccurate, or if an individual would like to update or review his or her personal information, the individual may contact us using the contact information below. As a security precaution, we may request that the individual provide identifying information such as name, address, birth date, and/or social security number. In addition, we may limit or deny access to personal information where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor Agreement. In some circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee, where warranted, for access to personal information.

### Accountability and Enforcement

We established a program to monitor our adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles and to address questions and concerns regarding our adherence. This program includes a statement verifying our adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles that is signed annually by our authorized representative. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns with us using the contact information below.  With respect to any dispute relating to this notice that cannot be resolved through our internal processes, we will cooperate with competent European Union data protection authorities and comply with the advice of such authorities. In the event that we or such authorities determine that we did not comply with this notice, we will take appropriate steps to address any adverse effects and to promote future compliance.

### Information Subject to Other Policies

We are committed to following the Safe Harbor Principles in processing all personal information. Other information we receive may be subject to policies that may differ in some respects from the policies set forth in this notice. Certain of our Web sites have their own privacy policies that apply specifically to those Web sites. Those policies may be accessed through the Web sites in question. Information relating to present or former ExactTarget personnel is subject to our policies concerning personnel data privacy, which are available to present and former ExactTarget personnel upon request.
