Furthermore, Exact monitors incoming and outgoing Site traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers and to administer its Site. Exact also uses this data to assemble broad demographic information about its visitors, customers, and partners in general. 

We do not usually seek sensitive information (for example, data relating to race or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, criminal record, physical or mental health or sexual orientation) from Site visitors. We will, where necessary, obtain your explicit consent to collect and use such information. The following is a list of examples where you may choose to specifically and voluntarily submit Personal Information to Exact through this Site, which Exact may use for each purpose(s) as you indicate at the time of your submission:

    * Request a copy of Exact’s annual report or other publications;

    * Participate in surveys, quizzes, promotions, and contests as may be available on the Site from time to time; and/or
    * Register for attendance or sponsorship at events and conferences.
  2. **Use of Your Personal Information.** Exact uses Personal Information submitted through the Site to provide a way for customers, partners, customer and partner prospects, and other contacts to communicate with our team. Exact collects the Personal Information from you in order to establish and maintain relationships, and in order to serve you better. When appropriate, Exact may also use the Personal Information separately or in combination with pre-existing information.
  3. By voluntarily submitting your Personal Information, you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Information as described in this Policy Statement. In some circumstances, Exact may share Personal Information that you voluntarily submit with trustworthy business partners. We will only use such third party business partners in order to deliver services to us or on our behalf, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Personal Information collected on this Site may be stored and processed in the Netherlands, the United States, Canada, or any other country in which Exact (or its affiliates, subsidiaries, and divisions and their respective third party business partners and suppliers) maintain facilities. This may include transfer to countries without data protection rules similar to those in effect in your country of residence. You acknowledge and agree that by providing Personal Information to Exact through this Site, you consent to the transmission of such Personal Information over international borders as necessary for processing your requests.

Due to the existing legal, regulatory, and security environment, Exact may be required, under certain circumstances, to disclose aggregate level and/or personally identifiable information submitted to Exact through the Site. Exact will use reasonable efforts to limit such disclosures to the following circumstances: (i) where Exact believes in good faith that it is required to do so in response to a subpoena or other legal process; (ii) where reasonably required to do so in order to maintain, update or otherwise implement Exact’s data security measures, equipment, technical operations and the like; (iii) where reasonably necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or entities to preserve and/or enforce Exact’s rights, including but not limited to enforcing the Terms of Use for this Site; (iv) protect and defend the rights or property of Exact; or (v) in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of the public or of users of the Exact products, services, and the Site.

In addition, Exact may also disclose Personal Information in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the Exact business or any part thereof, or as part of a security audit.

  4. **Protection of Your Personal Information.** Exact undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of the Personal Information, preferences and other information it has collected through this Site and will never knowingly allow access to this information to anyone outside Exact other than as described herein. Exact has made a substantial investment in its server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect the information assets of the Exact network, including the confidentiality of Personal Information collected through this Site. These technologies are deployed as part of a sophisticated security architecture and protocol. 

You should also do your part in protecting your information. Your Exact username and any password (if such is provided or enacted) are confidential, and we recommend that you not divulge them to anyone. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Internet as a public transmission network, neither Exact’s network nor data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect Personal Information that is transmitted to us by you, Exact cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. Thus, any Personal Information transmitted to us is done so at your own risk. Once we receive Personal Information, Exact undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of this information consistent with this Privacy Statement.

  5. **Cookies.** If you review or download information, we may track the visit through the use of "cookies". Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and you will find cookies at most major web sites.

Should you at any time desire to review, correct or update your Personal Information, you may update your relevant profile or registration (when applicable) or contact us using the contact information outlined in the "Contact Us" section below; Exact will comply with such requests as soon as commercially reasonable. In order to ensure the safety of Personal Information, please note you will be subject to providing sufficient evidence of your identity at the time of any such request before any Personal Information records will be made available by Exact.
