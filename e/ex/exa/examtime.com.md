We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system of your computer and browser type of your computer, for our system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.

##  COOKIES 

Our website uses "Cookies" to distinguish you from other users of our website. A Cookie is a small text file implanted by us and most other website operators (or an advertiser on this site) on the hard disk of your computer when you visit the site. Cookies can collect information about users of our site like you, such as your names, address, e-mail details, passwords and your user preferences. While cookies and the information they obtain may not identify a living individual on their own, they may be able to do so in combination with other information held by us or a third party. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site. The types of cookies used are highlighted on browsing to our website for the first time. The website uses session cookies for site navigation purposes. These cookies expire and are deleted at the end of a browsing session. We also use Google Analytics for tracking purposes. 

##  WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA 

The data that we collect from you will not be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area which consists of the European Union, Norway and Iceland ("EEA"). It will only be processed by staff operating in the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, processing your subscription, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. 

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. A server is a machine that amongst others stores and processes data or information. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site or your account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of or sending by you of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted or sent by you to our site; any transmission or sending by you is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access _i.e._ access to your data by a person who should not have such access.
