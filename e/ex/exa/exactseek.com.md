# Privacy Statement: ExactSeek.com

  


> This Privacy Policy covers the ExactSeek treatment of personal information that is recorded when you submit your site for inclusion in our database. 
> 
> Our privacy policy does not apply to the practices of other companies advertised, or otherwise listed, on the ExactSeek web site, nor does it extend to people that ExactSeek does not employ or manage. 

  


  **Information Collection and Use**

  


> ExactSeek offers two types of site listings - Standard and Featured. Unlike many directories and search engines that charge for site listings and collect personal information as well, ExactSeek Standard listings are free and the information we collect is primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Services, and generally this information is not shared with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected, if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that the law requires such disclosure or other special cases described below.
> 
> For our Standard Free Listings, membership is required under a valid verified email address. Upon the creation of a new member account, in lieu of a site submission fee you will be subscribed to either SiteProNews or SEO-News.
> 
> Your use of ExactSeek's services constitutes a business relationship wherein we provide a promotion service for your web  
>  site(s). In exchange, ExactSeek reserves the right to use the contact information collected during site submission to deliver notices regarding changes or updates to our service, to provide free newsletters (SiteProNews, SEO-News), to inform you of additions to the Jayde Online Network of web sites, or to send announcements and carefully screened offers and information on behalf of our partners or advertisers. 
> 
> You may remove yourself from any or all of our notice and announcement mailings at anytime using the unsubscribe methods provided in those mailings. Any mailing received from our company is clearly identified and includes a valid email address and unsubscribe link which you can use to remove yourself from future mailings. Should you encounter problems in this regard, contact [**support@exactseek.com**](mailto:support@exactseek.com). Our turnaround time for responding to unsubscribe requests is generally 24 hours.

> Members are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone number. The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). ExactSeek does not rent or sell email addresses nor any other personal data, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. 
> 
> However, in instances where ExactSeek.com and a partner jointly promote the Services, ExactSeek.com may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. In this instance, the partner may not use personal information for any other purpose. 
> 
> ExactSeek.com may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services. 

> A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. ExactSeek.com may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a Member, we will use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer information. 
> 
> Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control the use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.

> Your personal information is stored in a protected directory. Access is restricted to ExactSeek staff. 
> 
> ExactSeek does not store any credit card information, as all transactions are processed by PayPal or sold through 2Checkout.com. 

> It is ExactSeek.com's policy not to use or share personal information about Visitors or Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, ExactSeek.com may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect ExactSeek.com and our Members.

> In the event of a change in ownership, or a direct merger or acquisition of ExactSeek.com with another entity or multiple entities, all (or select aspects) of ExactSeek.com's customer information (including email addresses) may be transferred to a separate entity or entities. All ExactSeek.com subscribers and registered users will be notified within five business days of any change in ownership, merger or acquisition of ExactSeek.com's assets by a third party. Subscribers and users may choose to access and modify any of their registration and subscription information at that time. 

  


  **Changes to this Privacy Policy**

  


> ExactSeek may amend this policy from time to time. If significant changes are made in the way your personal information is used, we will post a prominent announcement on our site notifying you of the change. 

> Questions or suggestions may be sent to: [**Feedback**](mailto:info@exactseek.com?subject=RE:Feedback)
