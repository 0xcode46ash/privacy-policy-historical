###  **Links to Other Sites**

If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the www.exoticindiaart.com site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as www.exoticindiaart.com. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to an www.exoticindiaart.com site, you should read that site’s privacy statement before providing any personally identifiable information.

###  **Exoticindiaart.com does not share, sell, rent or trade your personal information with third parties other than as described within this privacy policy.**

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

**Agents/Service Providers**  
We use other third parties such as a shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services, we will share (such as your shipping address, phone number, or email) as necessary for the third party to provide that service.

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

We set a persistent cookie to maintain items in your shopping cart, so you don’t have to build it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as shopping cart, will be limited.

 _Third Party Cookies_

The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**  
Third parties employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

**Security**  
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number, national ID, personal health information) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
