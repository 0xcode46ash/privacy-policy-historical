# EverBank - Privacy and Security

Protecting your privacy and security.

NOTE: The following discussion of privacy and security applies only to information about your deposit and/or credit card account(s) you maintain for your personal or family use and related dealings with EverBank®. To the extent that you may have other accounts or relationships with EverBank or any of EverBank's other divisions or affiliates (including EverBank's National Home Loan Group or EverHome® Mortgage Company), this privacy policy does not cover those relationships.

Banking is all about trust, security, privacy, and confidence. EverBank designed its business with your privacy in mind and will continue this tradition by providing you with security and privacy protection. So that you understand exactly where EverBank stands on these important topics, we have created this document for you to review. Please take time to look over this Privacy Statement and contact a Customer Care Specialist with questions or for clarification. 

Information Collection and Sharing

Notice of Information Collection  
EverBank collects and retains information about its consumers from many sources, including:

  * Account applications or other forms you submit to EverBank, including information about your age, gender, marital status, number of dependants, assets, debts, income, employment information, and address.
  * Transactions you conduct with or through EverBank, EverBank's affiliates, or others, such as account balances, payment due dates, payment record, account status, and information you give to EverBank in any telephone call, letter, or e-mail.
  * Reports from Consumer Reporting Agencies, including information about your credit worthiness, financial circumstances, and credit history, including any bankruptcies or foreclosures.



Unless this information is public, it is known as "nonpublic personal information." EverBank uses the information it collects in the course of its relationship with you, to process your account application(s), provide you with services, and offer information to you about your account. EverBank also uses the information it collects to analyze your situation using traditional banking practices, and to tailor your experience at the EverBank website, displaying content and images EverBank believes may be of interest to you. 

In addition to the nonpublic personal information described above, EverBank collects information in other ways:

  * EverBank uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with its server, and to administer the website. An IP address is like a telephone number for a computer on the Internet. Just as one can locate a person’s or business’s phone number in the telephone book, computers can locate a website’s IP address using a Domain Name Service Server. EverBank also uses your IP address to help identify you and your browser as you move throughout the EverBank website, and to gather broad demographic information. In many cases, this allows EverBank to present a convenient, more customized website to you.
  * EverBank's site uses cookies to keep track of you as you move through the website. EverBank uses cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, and to provide access to the secure banking functions available on the EverBank website. Cookies are discussed in more detail below.



Information Security

Protecting your information is important to EverBank. To protect your information, EverBank has instituted policies, procedures, employee training, and communication programs. Examples of how EverBank protects your information include, but are not limited to, the following:

  * Restricting physical or other access to your nonpublic personal information to persons with a legitimate business need to know the information in order to process or service your account(s).
  * Contractually requiring third parties doing business with EverBank to comply with all privacy and security laws.
  * Maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.



You can help EverBank protect your information by keeping your account information, particularly personal identification numbers (PINs) and other access codes, confidential. 

Public Forums

The EverBank website may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. EverBank is not responsible for content posted by third parties to public forums. EverBank reserves the right to discontinue offering public forums at any time and for any reason. 

Encrypted Email

Encrypted e-mail not only provides authentication but also protects your privacy. If a message is properly encrypted, no one on the public Internet can read your message to EverBank. Encryption software "scrambles" the message so that only the intended recipient can read the message. Encrypted e-mail often supports a digital signature within the same process. When combined, encryption and a digital signature allow you to obtain both authentication and privacy. EverBank encourages and supports the use of encrypted messages for communication with the Bank. As an account holder, you will have access, from within the EverBank Online Financial Center online banking website, to an encrypted, secure web based e-mail system. That system will allow you to communicate via a secured channel with EverBank Customer Care Specialists.

Notice of Information Sharing

EverBank may share the information it collects and retains, as described above, with EverBank's affiliates or with unaffiliated third parties (such as credit reporting agencies, financial service providers, insurance companies, and other service providers). You understand and agree that EverBank may share this information in the following instances:

  * To verify the existence and condition of your accounts or loans for a credit bureau (consumer reporting agency) for purposes of recording your credit history with EverBank;
  * When it is necessary or helpful in completing transactions, such as to verify the existence and condition of your account for a merchant or bank for purposes of transactions you have requested using your account;
  * To comply with applicable governmental reporting or legal processes (such as court orders, subpoenas, or governmental requests) that EverBank reasonably believes to be valid or required;
