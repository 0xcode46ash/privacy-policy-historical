#### Online Information Collection

When you use our website, EverBank collects information in several ways:

  * If you use online banking services, we collect and use information as described in the applicable privacy notice.
  * EverBank collects and uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with its servers and to administer the website. An IP address is like a telephone number for a computer on the Internet. Just as one can locate a phone number in the telephone book, computers can locate an IP address using a Domain Name Service Server. EverBank also uses your IP address to help identify your computer and browser as you move throughout the EverBank website, and to gather general information such as where your Internet service provider is located or the type of service that you have. In many cases, this allows EverBank to present a convenient, more customized website to you.
  * Our website uses cookies to keep track of you as you move through the website. Cookies are small text files or text identifiers that are placed on your computer by EverBank and many other websites. Cookies are used to show which computer and browser accessed our site. By using cookies, EverBank can deliver content specific to your interests and provide access to our secure banking functions. Cookies do not disrupt your computer. If you choose, you may set your web browser to warn you before you accept a cookie and choose each time if you want to accept the cookie. You may also choose to obtain software that operates in conjunction with your browser to control cookie acceptance. Some portions of the EverBank website require the use of cookies so that EverBank can provide you with a secure environment for certain financial transactions. These features may not work properly if you restrict the use of cookies on the website.
  * In addition to cookies, EverBank uses tracking tags, pixels, web beacons, and/or similar technologies for purposes such as site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising auditing and reporting, providing customer service support and responding to your inquiries (including through the use of live chat or video session technologies), and personalization of a website. Any information that EverBank collects through such tags, pixels, web beacons, and/or similar technologies is anonymous, so we will not connect this information directly to you. 
  * EverBank also collects information that you provide to us through your use of the website and its features (including live chat or video sessions) to provide customer service support and to respond to your inquiries.



#### Information Security

Protecting your information is important to EverBank. We’ve instituted policies, procedures, employee training and communication programs designed for the sole purpose of protecting your information. Some examples of how EverBank protects your information include:

  * Restricting access to your nonpublic personal information to only those persons with a business need to know the information in order to process or service your account(s).
  * Contractually requiring third parties doing business with EverBank to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws.
  * Maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable federal and state standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.



By using our online services, you acknowledge that you will not, under any circumstances, disclose your EverBank password by telephone or any other means to any person, and you acknowledge that no person from the EverBank family of companies will ever ask you for your password and that our employees do not need and should not ask for your password. You agree not to provide your password to anyone claiming to represent us. You are liable for all transactions made or authorized using your username and password. You agree that if you give your username or password to anyone or fail to safeguard their secrecy, you do so at your own risk. 

#### Sharing Information

We may share information that we collect online and with trusted third parties according to the terms described in the applicable privacy notice (see Table 1 above), including for purposes of providing customer service support and responding to your inquiries (including through the use of chat or video-based technologies). Third party service providers with whom we share personally identifiable information are contractually obligated to keep the information confidential and to use the information only to provide the services we have asked them to perform.

For a description of how EverBank may share information collected from consumers who have applied for or obtained a consumer product or service from us, please refer to Table 1 above.

We will release specific information about you if we are compelled to do so to comply with valid legal processes such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, or a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency, or in the unlikely situation where we, in good faith, believe such information is necessary to prevent harm to you or others. As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might sell or buy online businesses or other assets. In such transactions, information about customers often is among the transferred assets. Accordingly, in the unlikely event that EverBank or substantially all of its assets is acquired by a third party, such information may be one of the transferred assets.

#### Public Forums

The EverBank website may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should not disclose your personal information. EverBank is not responsible for content posted by third parties to public forums. EverBank reserves the right to discontinue offering public forums at any time and for any reason.

#### Encrypted Email

Encrypted email not only provides authentication but also protects your privacy. Encryption software "scrambles" the message so that only the intended recipient can read the message. Encrypted email often supports a digital signature within the same process. When combined, encryption and a digital signature allows you to obtain both authentication and privacy. EverBank encourages and supports the use of encrypted messages for communication with EverBank. EverBank banking account holders have access from within the EverBank Online Financial Center to an encrypted, secure web-based email system. That system will allow you to communicate via a secured channel with EverBank Customer Care Specialists.

#### Fraud and Other Internet Risks

EverBank maintains customer authentication procedures to protect your personal information and account from identity theft. These procedures are for your protection. If you suspect a website is "spoofing" or pretending to be an EverBank website, do not enter personal information but instead please contact us using the contact information in Table 1 above, or send an email to **fraud@everbank.com**.

#### Information Collected in Surveys or Contests

From time to time, EverBank's website may use online surveys or run contests that ask you for contact information (such as your email address) and demographic information (e.g., zip code, age or income level). EverBank uses this contact and demographic data to send you information about EverBank and promotional material from certain partners. To request that we not send you information about EverBank and other promotional materials, see the "How to Refuse Further Communications" subsection below.

#### Other Information Collection

Demographic and profile data is also collected at EverBank's website. EverBank uses this data to tailor its visitor website experience, providing you content which EverBank believes may be of interest to you, and to display content based on your preferences.

#### Links to Other Sites

The EverBank website may contain links to other sites. EverBank is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of non-EverBank websites. Please review the privacy statement found on each of these sites when linking through.

#### How to Refuse Communications

EverBank's website provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from EverBank and its partners. If you do not wish to receive future communications, or you no longer wish to receive EverBank's services, you may request that EverBank remove your information from its database.

You can refer to the privacy policies included in Table 1 above for more information on your right to request that we not share certain aspects of your information.

#### Privacy Issues Contact Information

#### Protecting Children's Online Privacy

EverBank encourages protection of children's information on the internet. We will not intentionally collect personal information from children under 13 on our website without first obtaining consent from their parents or legal guardians. For more information about the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) please refer to the [**Federal Trade Commission's website**](http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html).

#### Changes

This notice describes our current online privacy practices. EverBank may change its online privacy practices in the future, and we may revise this notice to reflect material changes. If we do change our policy, we will note those changes on our website. A message will be displayed on our homepage for a period of time that a change has been made. We may also send an email describing the changes. Your continued use of the website following the posting of changes to these terms will mean that you accept those changes.
