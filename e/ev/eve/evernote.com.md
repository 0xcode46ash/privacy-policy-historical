# EverNote - Privacy Policy

Dated September 7th, 2004

EverNote Corporation (EverNote) has created this Privacy Policy to explain what information we collect, what we do with that information, and how we protect your privacy on the Internet. EverNote reserves the right to modify this policy from time to time without notice. Changes will be posted on the EverNote Web site.

## Information Collection and Use

EverNote is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We do not share, sell, rent or otherwise distribute this information to others, except as disclosed in this privacy policy. EverNote collects your personal information only in the following cases:

  * When you register with the riteMail service or update your record in this service. With such registration, we require your name, email address, and ask for other information, some of which may be required to use riteMail
  * When you send a riteMail message using the Java client, EverNote receives your User Name and Password from the cookie it stored on your device during the registration (see "Use of Cookies" below) and uses this information for automatic authentication of your account
  * When you send a riteMail message, EverNote identifies your email address and uses it for automatic authentication of your account



## Use of cookies

EverNote's riteMail service uses "cookies" - small data files that a Web site script writes to your hard drive. A cookie file contains your User Name and Password and is used for automatic authentication of your account to facilitate your access to the service. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. If cookies in your browser are disabled, this will also disable automatic riteMail authentication, in which case you will be required to enter User Name and Password for each riteMail message you send.

## Usage Log

EverNote's Web server also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address and possibly domain name, and the page you requested. IP addresses are not linked to "personally identifiable information" - data or facts that would reveal your identity. We may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track your navigation of the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information does not indicate the identity of particular Users.

EverNote may use your information to fulfill your requests for its products and services, and to contact you with information about such products and services. You have an "opt-out" option during the registration and may expressly decline receiving such information.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

EverNote currently does not sell, rent, lease or otherwise transmit or distribute your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information to anyone, except when:

  * We have your consent to share the information
  * We have a relationship with an affiliate or partner that you have an online or off-line (non-Internet) relationship with or have visited the affiliate or partner's website that links to or mentions EverNote's website and have registered for EverNote online services through the partner or affiliate's program or website. We may share your information with the affiliate or partner under these circumstances.
  * We need to share your information to fulfill your request for product or service
  * We are required to provide such information by law, subpoena, or court order
  * We find that your actions on our web sites violate Service Terms or any of our usage guidelines and/or rules for specific products or services



If EverNote ever changes its policy regarding the sharing and disclosure of information we will post a new Privacy Policy at this location.

## Changing or Deleting Your Information and Preferences
