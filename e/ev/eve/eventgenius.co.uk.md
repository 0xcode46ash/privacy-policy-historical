# Privacy Policy - Event Genius

### Privacy Policy

At Ticket Arena, your privacy is very important to us. We are committed to ensuring that when you choose us for your tickets, you know exactly what information we collect about you and how we use your information. 

Please take the time to read and understand our Privacy Policy. By using our website(s) and mobile apps, contacting us by telephone or email or providing information to us through social media channels, you agree to its terms.

To help you, we’ve included some links to other websites. It’s worth remembering though that other people, not us, control these websites (and we’re not responsible for them).

**What information do we collect and when?**

We collect:

  * ******All information you choose to provide to us.**  For example, if you submit your name, address, email and telephone numbers via our website as part of the ticket ordering process.
  * ******Information on what you view, click on and access** through our marketing emails, websites and mobile apps. For websites, this information may include the site that you came from, and where you went when you left our site. We also track how often you visit and use our websites and mobile apps. We do this via email and website cookies, and similar tracking technology built into our websites and mobile apps. We make cookie policies available on each of our websites and mobile apps to give you more detailed information on how we use them.
  * ******Technical information about the devices you use** to access our websites. We collect each device’s manufacturer and model, relevant IP address, operating system and version, web browser and version, and geographic location.
  * ******Your social media content** where this is in the public domain, and any messages you send **** direct to us via social media. **** This information can include posts and comments, pictures and video footage on sites such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.



**How do we collect your information?**

We collect information on you through:

  * our websites and mobile apps and your use of them, including completing the ticket application process and signing up for marketing communications from us;
  * emails you send to us, or that we send to you;
  * our conversations with you; and
  * your use of social media, including “like” buttons and similar functions made available by social media platforms.



**How do we use your information?**

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

  * ******To provide you with our websites and mobile apps** , which all require a certain amount of technical information to work properly.
  * ******To power our security measures and services** so you can safely access our website and **** mobile apps.
  * ******To run our members areas** including providing access to members and administering privileges, rewards and loyalty scheme points.
  * ******To help us run competitions and special offers** and make sure you get all the benefits you’re promised.
  * ******To collect feedback from you** about our websites, mobile apps, and other activities. For example, occasionally we may invite you to review a mobile app you’ve bought or used from us. If we do, it’s possible that we’ll use independent research and feedback providers to act on our behalf.
  * ******To contact you from time to time** regarding things you’ve told us you want to hear about; new products, for example, or special offers, competitions and sponsored events. If you use our mobile apps, we may use push notifications to highlight when we’ve added new offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. If you stop using our mobile apps, we may try and tempt you back to us.
  * ******To reply to any questions** , suggestions, issues or complaints you have contacted us about, including to provide you with any technical support you may have requested.
  * ******To respond to any social media posts** or other public comments you might make, whether they are directed to us or about us, our websites, mobile apps or other activities.
  * ******For recruitment purposes** if you have applied for a position with us including to contact you to discuss a role with us and to assess your suitability. As part of this we may combine any personal data you provide to us with other information we obtain independently from social media sites (e.g. LinkedIn or Facebook).
  * ******To advertise products or services** to **** you via our email and SMS newsletters.
  * ******To tell you** about any changes to our websites **** and mobile apps. For example, if we withdraw one of our apps for some reason, or change this privacy policy.
  * ******To make a contract with you.** But also to enforce a contract if you don’t honour it, including the collection of any debts that we may be owed by you.
  * ******To gather statistics** about how you and other people use our website and mobile apps and what you think of our advertisements, special offers, news, websites, mobile apps, competitions, sponsored events, social media and other content. We then analyse all this data to see if what we do is interesting to people and meets their needs, or if they should be improved, and if so, what changes would be most beneficial both for our customers and for us.
  * ******To monitor** how people **** use our websites and mobile apps to see if they are being abused orthreatened, for example, by internet trolls posting inappropriate comments in review areas or by would-be hackers looking to undermine our security.
  * ******To protect you** and our business from any other potentially criminal behaviour, **** including identity theft and fraud.
  * ******To allow us to understand our customer base** across all our businesses. We do this by merging your details with information from our other customers and users of our websites and mobile apps. We can then spot trends and common factors among users, plus we can tailor our business approach, our marketing communications, our digital and social media, our websites and mobile apps to the things we believe you and other people like you would be most interested in. This process involves the analysis of many human traits and is sometimes called ‘market segmentation’ or ‘customer segmentation’. Among other things, we look at common trends or ‘segments’ based on people’s geographic location, online behaviours on our websites or mobile apps and the features they look for from our mobile apps.
  * ******To help us conduct focused market research** based on trends and common factors, so we can further improve the mobile apps we offer to all our customers.
  * ******To test new systems and processes** as we roll them out (but generally only in anonymous form) to make sure they work correctly and meet the standards we set for ourselves.
  * ******To assist us in the development of new products and mobile apps** over a period of time. For example, we may need to gauge whether a new product or mobile app is likely to appeal to a large proportion of our customer base. And if not, we’ll want to know why.
  * ******To see if the money we spend** on marketing and advertising across all media represents good value for us or not.



**Who do we share with information with?**

We will only ever use your personal data for the purposes set out above.  However, we can’t run our business or provide our mobile apps without involving other people and organisations from time to time. When we share your information, we want you to know that we only do so in accordance with our legal data protection and privacy obligations.

Your information may be disclosed to:

  * ******Companies, brands and businesses within our group.** For example, we’ll share information with Ticket Arena and Event Genius. This is because we hope to have a relationship with you across all our different brands and businesses, if not now, then sometime in the future. And we want to be able to provide you with the same high quality experience whenever and however you deal with us.
  * ******Event organisers** to enable them to allow entry to the events, to send marketing communications and other promotional information to you by e-mail, SMS, post, phone, social media
  * ******With email marketing companies** who help us to mail our newsletter to you. **** Other people who help us provide our websites, mobile apps, and related services to you. They include information technology experts who design and host our websites and mobile apps and general service companies such as email marketing companies.
  * ******Any new business partners** we may have over time, for example, in the event of a joint venture, reorganisation, business merger or sale that affects us.
  * ******Our professional advisors** including our lawyers and technology consultants when they need it to give us their professional advice.
  * ******Law or tax enforcement, the courts** and any other government authority **** if they ask us to do so (but only if us doing so is lawful).
  * ******Other people who make a ‘subject access request’** , where we are allowed to do so by law. (See ‘Managing Your Information’ below for what we mean by a ‘subject access request’).



We may also share the information we collect where we are legally obliged to do so, e.g. to comply with a court order.

**Social media, blogs, reviews, etc.**

Any social media posts or comments you send to us (on our Facebook page, for instance) will be shared under the terms of the relevant social media platform (e.g. Facebook or Twitter) on which they’re written and could be made public. Other people, not us, control these platforms. We’re not responsible for this kind of sharing. So before you make any such remarks or observations, you should review the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the social media platforms you use. That way, you’ll understand how they will use your information, what information relating to you they will place in the public domain, and how you can stop them from doing so if you’re unhappy about it.

It’s worth remembering too, that any blog, review or other posts or comments you make about us, our products and services on any of our blogs, reviews or user community services will be shared with all other members of that service and the public at large.

You should take extra care to ensure that any comments you make on these services, and on social media in general are fit to be read by the public, and are not offensive, insulting or defamatory. At the end of the day, you are responsible for ensuring that any comments you make comply with any relevant policy on acceptable use of those services.

**Mobile app platforms**

Our mobile apps run on third party software platforms, for example, Apple’s iOS platform which powers Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android platform which powers Android-based smartphones.

If you use any of our mobile apps, your usage of those apps is also subject to the relevant mobile app platform provider’s terms and conditions and privacy policy. You should review their terms and conditions and privacy policy to ensure you understand what information (if any) they will gather about you, how they will use that information, and what you may be able to do if you are unhappy about it.

**Secruity of your information**

We take the security of your information very seriously.

We use appropriate procedures and technical security measures to safeguard your information across all our computer systems, networks, websites, mobile apps and offices and comply with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office security guidance.

**How long do we keep your informartion?**

To make sure we meet our legal data protection and privacy obligations, we only hold on to your information for as long as we actually need it for the purposes we acquired it in the first place (those purposes are set out above).

After that we will either delete it or anonymise it so that it cannot be linked back to you.

**Managing our marketing communications**

We provide ways for you to stop all email and text (SMS or MMS) communications you receive from us – please see the ‘unsubscribe’ link and ‘STOP’ details we include in each email and text message respectively.

If you would like us to change your marketing preferences at any time, you can contact us at support@ticketarena.co.uk. 

**Managing your information**

To reduce the chances of an error or misunderstanding, we need to keep the information we gather about you is accurate and up-to-date. But whilst we work very hard to make sure mistakes don’t happen, we need your help, too.

Further, if you have reason to believe any of the information we collect on you may be inaccurate, please contact us (see below for how to do this). 

You are perfectly within your rights to ask us whether we hold information about you and if so, for us to give you certain details about that information and/or the information itself. This right is commonly known as a ‘subject access request’. Certain exemptions and conditions apply to this right, principally that it should be in writing and that you give us reasonable details about the information you want.

Depending on your country of residence or domicile, you may have additional or different rights to those set out above concerning the information we collect from you and your devices. We will, of course, honour all such legal rights if we are bound by them.

We reserve the right to charge you a small administration fee to meet our costs in honouring your legal rights, where permitted by the relevant law.

We also reserve the right not to comply with any enquiries or requests we receive about the information we collect, where we may lawfully do so. For example, if we have reason to believe that a request is malicious, technically impossible, involves disproportionate effort or could be harmful to others.

If you have any worries or complaints about the way we use your information, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us. We’ll do our very best to set your mind at rest or put things right. And if, for whatever reason, you feel we’re not meeting the exceptionally high standards we expect of ourselves, you’re within your rights to tell the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) (in the UK)). Please see the section ‘Where to go if you want more information about your privacy rights’ for further details.

And don’t forget that with modern technology you have more and more personal control over what information we and other organisations collect. For example, you can normally reject or delete cookies and tracking technologies sent to your web browser. You can also change related settings to restrict them going forward, such as by using a private browsing mode (although this may affect your browsing experience on some websites). Plus, you can use the settings options in your mobile devices to restrict what sort of information websites and mobile apps are able to access and use about you. Online advertising networks, social media platforms and search engines (Google etc.) also provide tools to manage the data they collect about you, and how it is used and shared. We urge you to look out for these functions and tools and use them to manage your privacy in a way that suits you best.]

**Updates to this privacy policy**

We review the ways we use your information regularly. And in doing so, we may change what kind of information we collect, how we store it, who we share it with and how we act on it.

Consequently, we will need to change this privacy policy from time to time to keep it accurate and up-to-date.

If following any changes, you continue to use our websites and mobile apps, contact us by telephone or otherwise provide information to us (through social media, for example) we will assume that you agree to those changes.
