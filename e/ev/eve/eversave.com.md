**Privacy @ Eversave.com**  
Eversave.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. It is our policy to allow our users to control the amount of personal information they provide to us and how we use that information. We hope that users will feel comfortable providing this information to us, because it is through this information that we are able to tailor our Savings Offers to each member's particular interests, thereby making the Eversave experience a more valuable one. However, we recognize that some members will prefer not to provide certain requested information. We've designed Eversave with the members' personal preferences in mind. 

The following privacy statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Eversave.com Web site. 

**_What Information We Collect/How We Use It_**  
_Contact Information_. Our site's registration form requests users to give us contact information (like your name, e-mail address, and zip code). Some of the requested information is required in order to receive the Eversave service; other information is optional. The required information is clearly marked as such on the registration pages. We use users' information in three ways: 1. if the user so chooses, to send via e-mail targeted advertising, promotions and coupons based on their interests; 2. to contact users for feedback and surveys; and 3. to send users other information about Eversave. 

Eversave.com does not share any of your individual information with third parties. 

_Profile Data_. Profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the member's Eversave experience through our personalized home page and e-mails. By obtaining this information, we provide users with specific content based on indicated interests and preferences. None of this information is required in order to receive the Eversave service. The user may include only the information he or she feels comfortable including. However, the omission of certain information will limit the value of the Eversave experience for the member. 

We do not share any of your individual profile information with third parties and we do not sell or rent lists about our membership. Geographic, demographic, and category preference information across member profiles may be summarized to create media kits for merchants advertising on Eversave. Media kits are standard marketing collateral used in advertising to help prospective sponsors understand the viewership they will reach. Aggregate information includes percent membership by Age range, percent membership by Gender and percent membership by Category preference. Please refer to the following section "Reports" for more information. 

_Reports_. We provide reports to a limited number of companies with which we do business. These reports include aggregate information about our users. The information in these reports will not identify you individually. There will be no information contained in the reports that would allow outside companies to contact you directly. 

_Referral Program_. As part of our referral program, we request contact information (like the name and e-mail address) of visitors' friends and family whom they think would like to receive the Eversave service. We treat referral information with the same confidentiality described for handling member information. Eversave.com sends the referred person an e-mail. The person referred to us only becomes enrolled through their own choosing by responding to the e-mail and entering their own information. 

_Membership Card Data_. Eversave.com may receive data about your purchases from merchants that accept the Eversave Membership Card. This information is used to provide you with additional offers in which you may be interested. 

_Links_. This site contains links to other sites. Eversave.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. If you have a question about the privacy policy of those web sites, please visit them directly. 

_Contests/New Member Promotions_. From time to time, we run contests and new member promotions on our site in which we ask visitors for postal contact information, e.g. name and mailing address, in order to participate in the contest or promotion so that we may deliver awards or incentives. The Referral Program described above also requires that a member provide their name and mailing address so that referral redemptions may be delivered. 

Members will only receive email correspondence to indicate membership, contest, or promotion status, or to communicate merchant savings as part of our service. It is not our practice to otherwise communicate by postal mail. Members will only receive postal correspondence to indicate membership, contest, or promotion status when email contact cannot be established. 

**_Changes in Privacy Practice_**   
In the event of any fundamental amendment to the privacy statement for Eversave.com, both the new and the old privacy statements will be posted for a period of 30 days on the privacy policy page that you are currently reading. Users will be notified by email 30 days in advance of the Privacy statement change. A link to the new statement will also be displayed on the site. After 30 days, only the new privacy statement will appear. 

During the 30 day period, users may change their status with Eversave.com either as described in the "Changing Your Status" section of the Privacy statement, or as described in any notice. After 30 days, the new privacy policy will be in effect regarding the usage and treatment of information. 

**_Cookies_**   
We use cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. Cookies are a standard internet technology that allow us to store and retrieve your login information on your system. The cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the identity of any of our users. You may choose not to have your password stored during the registration process (you will need to enter your password each time you want to access your personalized Eversave Web page). 

Cookies are also used to enable your sessions on Eversave.com so that the web pages presented to you are consistent. Based on this implementation of session management, you must have cookies enabled to use our site. 

Finally, when a user comes to Eversave.com from certain other web sites, a cookie may be placed by a third party ad server that helps Eversave.com understand how new members come to our site through ad banners on other sites through the point of Eversave.com registration. The third party ad server places similar cookies on other web sites so that it understands your interests across web sites. 

Although cookies must be enabled to access Eversave.com, this specific third-party cookie does not have to be present in your 'Cookies' folder to access our site. If you wish to eliminate cookies placed by this third party server, you must delete them from the 'Cookies' folder in the 'Windows' folder of Microsoft Windows systems. If you are not able to determine which cookies are being set by this server, you may choose to delete all cookies, but note that this action will eliminate any control information that has been set-up by other web sites you visit. In the case of Eversave.com, the next time you visit [http://www.eversave.com](http://www.eversave.com/), a new cookie will be placed to guide your session interaction. 

**_Log Files_**   
Log files are generated on all web sites on the Internet, including Eversave.com, according to the standards for HTTPD web server technology as described by the standards organization, W3C (WorldWideWeb Consortium). Log files contain 'clickstream information', i.e. transactions about the web pages viewed during a session, including the originating web site/web page, navigation to another web site/web page, the type of browser used, date/time, and success status of the server transaction. 

Links between pages are described using a URL (Universal Resource Locator) address, e.g.[http://www.eversave.com](http://www.eversave.com/). Each page viewed has a unique address that is recorded as a transaction in the server log. Transactions about all pages viewed on Eversave.com are analyzed to administer the web site (i.e. ensure a page is viewable) and to count visits to a page (important to merchants to know how good their offer is). An individual's session activity in the logs is associated with an account for the purpose of generating relevant savings offers. Finally, web site design uses log transactions to optimize site navigation. 

**_Security_**   
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Eversave uses networking, server, database, and procedural mechanisms to safeguard the integrity and privacy of data. 

**_Changing Your Status_**   
If you would like to change any of your profile information in our database, you can do so by logging in to Eversave and clicking on the "Update Preferences" button and following the directions. This will automatically change the information contained in our database. 

Because we want our users to feel completely comfortable using the Eversave services, you have the option to not receive e-mail as part of our service and to no longer receive communication from us. 

To no longer receive e-mail as part of our service, answer 'no' to "I would like to receive e-mails with savings offers" on your personal profile page. You will not receive any further e-mail savings notifications from us. Alternatively, send an e-mail to [Unsubscribe@mail1.eversave.com](mailto:Unsubscribe@mail1.eversave.com). 

**_Contact Us_**  
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, e-mail us at [helpdesk@Eversave.com](mailto:helpdesk@Eversave.com).
