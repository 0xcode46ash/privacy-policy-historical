**Privacy @ Eversave.com**  
Eversave.com has created this statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. We allow our users to control the amount of personal information they provide to us and how we use that information. Eversave.com hopes that users will feel comfortable providing this information to us, because this information allows us to tailor our Savings Offers to each member's particular interests. However, we recognize that some members will prefer not to provide certain requested information and so we've designed Eversave with the members' personal preferences in mind. 

**_What Information We Collect/How We Use It_**  
_Contact Information_. Our registration form requests users to provide contact information (e.g., name, e-mail address, and zip code). Some information is required in order to receive the Eversave service and other information is optional. The required information is clearly marked on the registration pages. We use the information in three ways: 1. At the member's request, we send e-mails with targeted advertising, promotions and coupons based on user's interests; 2. We contact users for feedback and surveys; and 3. We send users other information about Eversave. 

Eversave.com will present members with offers via email and a personalized web page on behalf of leading retailers and service providers. Eversave.com will not share any of your individual information with third parties unless you have specifically requested for Eversave.com to share your information with select companies. 

_Profile Data_. We use profile data to provide members with a personalized home page and tailored e-mails. This information allows us to provide users with specific content based on indicated interests and preferences. This information is not required in order to receive the Eversave service. Users may provide as much or as little information as they choose. However, the omission of certain information may limit the value of the Eversave experience for the member. 

Eversave acts as a consolidator of savings offers on behalf of retailers and service providers. Geographic, demographic, and category preference information across member profiles may be summarized for merchants advertising on Eversave. This helps prospective sponsors understand the viewership they will reach. Aggregate information includes percent membership by Age range and Gender, and Category preference. Please refer to the following section "Reports" for more information. 

_Reports_. We provide reports to a limited number of companies with which we do business. These reports include aggregate information about our users. The information in these reports will not identify individual members. No information is contained in the reports that would allow outside companies to contact members directly. 

_Referral Program_. Participants in the referral program, provide us with contact information (like the name and e-mail address) for friends and family whom they refer. We treat referral information with the same confidentiality as member information. Eversave.com sends the referred person an e-mail. The person referred to us only becomes enrolled if they choose to respond to the e-mail and enter their information. 

_Membership Card Data_. Eversave.com may receive data about member purchases from merchants that accept the Eversave Membership Card. This information is used to provide additional offers in which members may be interested. 

_Links_. This site contains links to other sites. Eversave.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. If you have a question about the privacy policy of those web sites, please visit them directly. 

_Contests/New Member Promotions_. Eversave runs contests and new member promotions on our site. We ask these participants for postal contact information(e.g. name and mailing address) so that we may deliver awards or incentives. The Referral Program described above also requires that a member provide their name and mailing address so that referral redemptions may be delivered. 

Members will only receive email correspondence to indicate membership, contest, or promotion status, or to communicate merchant savings as part of our service. It is not our practice to otherwise communicate by postal mail unless email contact cannot be established. 

**_Changes in Privacy Practice_**   
In the event of any fundamental amendment to the privacy statement for Eversave.com, both the new and the old privacy statements will be posted for a period of 30 days on this Privacy Policy page. Users will be notified by email 30 days in advance of the Privacy statement change. A link to the new statement will also be displayed on the site. After 30 days, only the new privacy statement will appear. During the 30 day period, users may change their status with Eversave.com as described in the "Changing Your Status" section of the Privacy Statement or as described in any notice. After 30 days, the new privacy policy will be in effect regarding the usage and treatment of information.

Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the identity of any of our users. You may choose not to have your password stored during the registration process (you will need to enter your password each time you want to access your personalized Eversave Web page). 

Cookies are also used on Eversave.com so that the web pages presented to you are consistent. Based on this implementation of session management, you must have cookies enabled to use our site. 

Finally, when a user comes to Eversave.com from certain other web sites, a cookie may be placed by a third party ad server that helps Eversave.com understand how new members come to our site.. The third party ad server places similar cookies on other web sites so that it understands your interests across web sites. 

Although cookies must be enabled to access Eversave.com, this specific third-party cookie does not have to be present in your 'Cookies' folder to access our site. If you wish to eliminate cookies placed by this third party server, you must delete them from the 'Cookies' folder in the 'Windows' folder of Microsoft Windows systems. If you are not able to determine which cookies are being set by this server, you may choose to delete all cookies. However, this action will eliminate any control information that has been set-up by other web sites you visit.

**_Log Files_**   
Log files are generated on all web sites on the Internet, including Eversave.com. These files are set according to the standards for HTTPD web server technology as described by the standards organization, W3C (WorldWideWeb Consortium). These Log files contain 'clickstream information' (i.e. transactions about the web pages viewed during a session, including the originating web site/web page, navigation to another web site/web page, the type of browser used, date/time, and success status of the server transaction). 

Links between pages are described using a URL (Universal Resource Locator) address, e.g.[http://www.eversave.com](http://www.eversave.com/). Each page viewed has a unique address that is recorded as a transaction in the server log. Transactions about all pages viewed on Eversave.com are analyzed to administer the web site and to count visits to a page. An individual's session activity in the logs is associated with an account for the purpose of generating relevant savings offers. Finally, web site design uses log transactions to optimize site navigation.
