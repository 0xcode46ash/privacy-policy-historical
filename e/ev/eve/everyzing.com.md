# Privacy Policy · RAMP-The Content Optimization Company

#### Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to our data collection and use practices relating to your use of the RAMP search engine, our Web site and our other products and services (collectively, the “RAMP Services”). By using the Web site and the other RAMP Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and any modifications made to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply, however, to the co-branded pages of our partners, affiliates and service providers. The terms “RAMP”, “we”, “our” or “us” refer to RAMP Corp.

#### INFORMATION GATHERED

When you request information or content from RAMP and supply information or content that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you, you are agreeing to share that information with RAMP, its agents, representatives and affiliates. For example, when registering for the RAMP Services, you may provide us with your name, e-mail address, possibly credit card or payment information and, in order to participate in our advertising program, information regarding your PayPal account.

When you visit our Web site or use the RAMP Services, we use standard Web server log files to automatically record information, including your URL, IP address, browser type and language, specific search requests, the date and time of your request, and the results of your searches. We also collect personal information when you register for the RAMP Services or voluntarily provide such information. We may combine personal information that we collect from you with information that we collect from other end users or third parties to provide a better user experience, including customizing content for you.

We also use cookies and obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses [www.RAMP.com](http://www.ramp.com/). “Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Our Web site may use cookies to store pertinent user information during a session to speed navigation and keep track of items. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive new cookies and how to disable cookies altogether.

#### USE OF INFORMATION

We may use your personal information to provide the RAMP Services you’ve requested, including services that display customized content and advertising. We may also use your personal information for auditing, research and analysis to operate and improve our technologies and the RAMP Services.

We may use information stored in cookies to allow content creators to log-in and access their account and to manage their content (i.e. add, delete or change feeds).

We also use the information that we collect to communicate with you. We may use your personal information that we collect to provide you with details about promotions and services that we believe may be of interest to you, but we will only do so if you separately request, at the time of registration or at a later date, to receive these details

#### SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES

We may share aggregate statistics, demographic information and other non-personally identifiable usage information about you to advertisers and other third parties. This information, however, will not be not linked to any of our user’s personally identifiable usage information.

In addition, we routinely contract with third parties to provide us with specific services. We will share names and other information with these third parties, but only to the extent that is necessary for such third parties to provide these services.  
We may also (a) share your personal information with our subsidiaries, affiliates, agents and representatives for the limited purpose of providing services or information to us or you, at our direction or (b) sell, transfer or otherwise disclose your personal information, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of substantially all of our assets, or other fundamental corporate change respecting RAMP.

If at any time you are uncertain about whether or not your personal information will be provided to a third party, please feel free to contact us at: [privacy@RAMP.com](mailto:privacy@RAMP.com)

#### ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We may disclose your personal information with your consent, whether by opt-in, opt-out or other form of consent. We may also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us, our agents, representatives and affiliates; (b) protect and defend our rights or property or the users of the RAMP Services or our Web site; and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the RAMP Services or the public.
