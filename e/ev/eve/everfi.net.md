# EverFi Portal: COPPA Privacy Policy

Last modified November 30, 2011

EverFi, Inc. of Washington D.C. (“EverFi” “we” or “us” or “our”) is committed to providing an informative and engaging educational technology platform for all of its users.  EverFi feels strongly about protecting the privacy of its users.  EverFi owns or operates the websites listed at the following link: Website List. These websites and the services available thereon and other services we may make available from time to time (together with associated and successor websites and services) are referred to as the “Service”.  This General Privacy Policy informs you of the policies of EverFi, regarding information that we collect from users of our Service.  This General Privacy Policy applies only to information that we collect. 

**BY USING THE SERVICE OR PROVIDING ANOTHER PERSON WITH ACCESS TO USE THE SERVICE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE SERVICE OR PROVIDE ANOTHER PERSON WITH ACCESS TO USE THE SERVICE. CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICE FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF CHANGES TO THIS GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY MEANS THAT YOU ACCEPT THOSE CHANGES.**

**1). How We Collect and Use Information:**

In addition to the specific uses described below, EverFi generally uses the information collected through the Service to provide the Service to users, to help us understand who uses the Service, for internal operations such as to improve the Service, and to contact users for customer service and billing purposes.   We may use a Service user’s information to send a welcoming email that may confirm the user’s user name and password.  Without requiring the user to “opt-in”, we may send the user electronic newsletters and marketing materials, contact the user about products, services, information and news that may be of interest to the user, and provide the user with targeted feedback.  In addition, if a user identifies himself or herself to us by sending us an email with questions or comments, we may use the user’s information (including personally identifiable information) to respond to the user’s questions or comments, and we may file such questions or comments for future reference.  We may also use the information collected to send important service announcements and updates regarding the Service or, if applicable, about billing account status. You will not be able to unsubscribe from these service announcements and updates as they contain important information relevant to the use of the Service.

We may also use the information gathered through the Service to perform statistical analysis of user behavior or to evaluate and improve the Service.  We may link some of this information to personally identifiable information for internal purposes or to improve users’ experience with the Service.  All information collected may be used or shared by EverFi as described in this General Privacy Policy on a worldwide basis.

**_Personally Identifiable Information_**

Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a Service user or can be used to identify or contact a Service user. Such information may include a Service user’s name, address, email address, and telephone number.  EverFi may collect personally identifiable information during the registration process from a user or from a user’s Entity (as defined below).  This information allows EverFi (and the schools, organizations, and teachers who use our products) to track the use of our educational technology platform and Service.  Although not a requirement, we may also collect and use email addresses to help with customer support calls and to allow users access to self-service functions such as password reset features, etc. 

**_Non-Personally Identifiable Information_**

Non-personally identifiable information is information, any single item of which, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact a Service user, such as demographic information (like age, profession, current location, zip code, or gender). Non-personally identifiable information may also include user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, user name, test results, test scores, survey data, and statistical data involving the use of the Service.  We collect non-personally identifiable information during the registration process and also through the use of cookies and log files, as described in this General Privacy Policy.  One type of non-personally identifiable information that we collect is aggregate information regarding overall server/visitor traffic and navigation patterns for the Service, which is collected for basic system monitoring.  Web servers collect this type of basic information automatically as part of Web log processes.  This tracking helps us improve the design and content of our Service.  As further described below, we also collect aggregate information concerning the demographics and progress of our users.

**_Surveys_**

EverFi collects data from surveys, including demographic information to help us evaluate the effectiveness of our courses.  EverFi will extract all individual pieces of personally identifiable information (such as name, e-mail address, and, if appropriate, login ID) from any survey data before sharing such data with a user’s Entity (as defined below) or any other third party. 

**_Contests and Advisory Boards_**

Through the Service, users who are over the age of 18 have the option to enter contests or to participate in advisory panels.  Such users may be required to enter additional information, such as an email address.  This participation is completely optional; users are not required to participate in such activities in order to use the Service.

**_Use of Cookies_**

As a standard practice, EverFi uses “cookies”.  EverFi may use cookies on its Service to ensure the integrity of the registration process and to personalize course content.  A cookie is a small text file that is placed on a user’s hard disk by a Web page server.  Cookies are uniquely assigned to a user and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie. Only session cookies are used, which means that the cookie will only exist on a computer while a user is on the Service. If a user logs out or closes his or her browser window, he or she will delete the cookie. No information persists.  Please note that if you refuse the EverFi cookie (by turning cookies off in your browser or by clicking “don’t accept” if you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies), the offerings, features, and resources of the Service will not work.  In order to use the Service, a user may need to decrease the security or privacy settings of his or her browser to accept cookies. 

**_Collection of IP Addresses_**

As with many sites, an IP address is visible to us when users visit our Service.  An IP address is a number automatically assigned to an individual’s computer whenever he or she is connected to the Internet.  EverFi will only use IP addresses when users sign up for the Service to help diagnose problems with our server. 

**_Note regarding credit card information:_** For users who register and take our e-commerce online course through the http://www.outsidetheclassroom.com website, credit card information and payments are collected and processed by a third-party site managed by Verisign. We do not collect or store any credit card information on our servers.

**2). SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES:   **

**_Service Users’ Entities_**

We may share all information about a user’s use of and performance on the Service with the school and school district and/or other organization (an “Entity”) that provides the user with access to use the Service, including the Entity’s representatives, such as teachers and administrators.  Such information will be provided, via a password protected administrative portal, and may include, but will not be limited to:

         Course progress/completion

         Exam scores

         Email address (if applicable)

         User ID/identifying tag or username (if applicable)

         Additional aggregate data the Entity or Entity’s representative request

**_Teachers and Administrators_**

As noted above, we may share all information about a user’s use of and performance on the Service with the teachers, administrators, and other representatives of the Entity that provides the user with access to use the Service.  Such information will be provided, via a password protected administrative portal, and may include, but will not be limited to:

         Course progress/completion

         Exam scores

         Email address (if applicable)

         User ID/identifying tag or username (if applicable)

         Additional aggregate data the Entity or Entity’s representative request

**_Third-Party Sponsors_**

EverFi works with third-party sponsors to bring our courses to some Entities free-of-charge.  We only share non-personally identifiable user information with our sponsors.  We, however, may aggregate the information that we collect from users of our Service to create demographic profiles and performance profiles regarding the progress of users who use the Service. This aggregated information may be shared with third parties in the form of group statistics.

**_Laws and Legal Rights_**

We may disclose a Service user’s information (including personally identifiable information) if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process. We may disclose personally identifiable information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the **[Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20130616153556id_/http%3A//www.everfi.net/terms.asp) **for our Service, to detect fraud, for assistance with a delinquent account, or to protect the safety and/or security of our users, the Service or the general public.

**_Third Parties Generally_**

We may provide to third parties non-personally identifiable information about Service users, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of the Service. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit the Service, the demographic breakdown of our registered users of the Service, and the test results and progress of users.  The third parties to which we may provide non-personally identifiable information may include affiliates, actual or potential commercial partners, students, customers, sponsors, Entities of Service users, licensees, researchers and other similar parties.

**_Outside Contractors_**

We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, "Outside Contractors") to provide specific services related to the Service, such as hosting and maintaining the Service, providing credit card processing and fraud screening, and developing applications for the Service and e-mail services. In the course of providing services to us, these Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected through the Service, including users’ personally identifiable information. 

**_Sale of Business_**

We reserve the right to transfer information (including personally identifiable information) to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of EverFi or any of its Affiliates, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this General Privacy Policy.

**_Affiliates_**

We may disclose information (including personally identifiable information) about Service users to our Affiliates. For purposes of this General Privacy Policy, "Affiliate" means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with EverFi, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to Service users that we provide to our Affiliates will be treated by those Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this General Privacy Policy.

**3). Other Websites:   **

Our Service may contain links to other websites not owned or operated by EverFi. However, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites. We encourage you to be aware when the Service links to other websites and to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every website. This General Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected through the Service.

**4). Protecting Your Information:**

EverFi has multiple security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control.  However, no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.  We believe that we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.

**5). Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:**

EverFi is committed to protecting the privacy of children.  Please see our [COPPA Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20130616153556id_/http%3A//www.everfi.net/coppa1.asp) for our guidelines concerning the collection of information from children under the age of 13. 

**6). Amendments:**  

EverFi may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.  We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes.  Your continued use of the Service following the posting of changes to this General Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of those changes.
