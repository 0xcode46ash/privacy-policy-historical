# Privacy Policy | Evergage

**Evergage, Inc. Privacy Statement**

Evergage, Inc. (“ **Evergage** ” or “ **we** ” or “ **us** ”) provides an online service (the “ **Evergage Service** ”) to help our customers (“ **Evergage Clients** ”) make their products and services (“ **Client Services** ”) more successful.  In order to provide the Evergage Service, Evergage collects certain information, as described in this Privacy Statement, from both Evergage Clients and their end user customers (“ **End Users** ”).  Evergage is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of both Evergage Clients and End Users.  The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you, as an Evergage Client or an End User, about our privacy practices.  We encourage you to read this Privacy Statement in order to learn more about how we safeguard your privacy. 

_**Who are Evergage Clients?**_

Evergage Clients are online service providers who use the Evergage Service to understand how their End Users are using their services and how that use is changing over time.  Knowing their End Users better enables Evergage Clients to serve their End Users.  Please be sure to review the privacy policies of any online services that you may use, as we do not control third parties.  

_**END USER INFORMATION**_

_**What information does Evergage collect regarding End Users?**_

  * It is at Evergage Clients’ discretion what actions and information they collect from each End User.  However, Evergage requires Evergage Clients to observe all applicable laws and regulations relating to the protection of data privacy and to only collect information that is necessary to improve Client Services and successfully serve their End Users.  A primary use of Evergage is to understand how End Users are using the Evergage Client’s service.  Many Evergage Clients send us, on a per-user basis, a subset of the actions taken by each End User within such Evergage Clients’ services and when such actions were taken.
  * For example, suppose John Doe used company XYZ’s document management system to upload a document, edit it, and share it with three friends.  If XYZ was an Evergage Client, XYZ might collect and send to Evergage that John Doe edited a document at a certain time and that he has 5 documents in XYZ’s system.   Later, XYZ might decide to also collect and send to Evergage when John shares a document and into what format he converted the document to share it.  XYZ could use this information to improve their product and to email John Doe with training about better ways to to share a document.
  * The data that Evergage Clients choose to send us may be personally identifiable information. 



_**Does Evergage require Evergage Clients to inform the End User about their use of the Evergage Service?**_

We require that all Evergage Clients maintain a truthful and accurate privacy policy that discloses the type of information collected, and that the information is shared with third party service providers for the purpose of improving performance.  However, Evergage does not require Evergage Clients to disclose that information is shared with Evergage in particular, so Evergage Clients’ privacy policies may not name Evergage specifically.  In addition, Evergage conducts routine audits on the data provided to us by Evergage Clients to monitor compliance with our agreements with Evergage Clients, this Privacy Statement, and applicable data privacy laws and regulations

_**How does Evergage use the information it collects?**_

  * The information Evergage collects on End User activities with Client Services is the property of the Evergage Client, not of Evergage.  We store the data in a unique security domain for each Evergage Client.   Our algorithms process and analyze each Evergage Clients’ data separately to give that Evergage Client insight into how their service is being used, how it could be improved, and how to better serve its End Users. 
  * Evergage also aggregates information across Evergage Clients to (i) improve the Evergage Service, (ii) benchmark usage patterns and behavior for a particular Evergage Client and for Evergage Clients generally, (iii) publish interesting analysis of trends or behaviors and (iv) other similar uses.



_**Will Evergage provide information about me to anyone else?**_

Except as provided below in the sections entitled  _Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers_  and  _Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others_ , we never divulge End User data in a personally identifiable, unique or non-aggregated manner to anyone other than the Evergage Client on whose behalf we are collecting and analyzing its End User data.

_**How does Evergage make sure my information is secure?**_

Evergage takes the security and privacy of Evergage Client data and End User data very seriously.  We use industry standard best practices to secure our systems and access to the data.  Each Evergage Client’s data is kept separate from each other Evergage Client’s data.  Each Evergage Client’s data flows through our system in a separate message queue, is stored in separate files on disk, and is a part of a unique security domain.  Access to that security domain is protected by user authentication.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet and no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.  Therefore, while we strive to use industry standard best practices to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

_**Does Evergage use cookies?**_

  * Like many websites we sometimes employ “cookies,” small packets of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier that are sent to a user’s browser from a website’s computer and stored on the user’s computer’s hard drive.  The website placing the cookie on the user’s computer can then recognize the computer when the user navigates the website at a later time.  For example, this allows us to remember user preferences and measure user behavior, information that Evergage Clients may then use to improve user interaction with their services. 
  * Evergage makes use of first party cookies.  
  * Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, your browser setting can usually be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer.  Consult the help manual for your browser for detailed information.  For further information about disabling cookies, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) .  If you choose to decline cookies, you may lose some of the functionality associated with certain Evergage Clients’ services that are provided by the use of cookies.  Please refer to the privacy policy of the company that is an Evergage Client for more information about its interactive features that depend on cookies.



_**Does Evergage use a web tag or javascript beacon?**_

How data is collected and sent to Evergage is at the discretion of the Evergage Client.  Evergage does provide a javascript beacon that Evergage Clients can integrate with their online service to collect usage data.  If the Evergage Client uses this javascript beacon, data is sent directly from the End User’s browser to Evergage for storage and analysis. 

_**Are there ways that I can opt out of allowing an Evergage Client to collect data on my use of its service?**_

Yes.  If you are an End User of an Evergage Client and do not wish for us to collect information about your use of that service, there are several options:

  1. We respect the “Do Not Track” Settings on most modern browsers.  Set this flag on your browser and we will not collect data from our javascript beacon.  Remember to set this flag on each browser that you use.
  2. Please review the privacy policy of the company that is an Evergage Client and follow that company’s instructions for opting out of data collection.   
  3. We have provided Evergage Clients with the ability to filter and dispose of usage data related to a particular End User’s userID.  If you would like to opt out of having your data sent to Evergage, please contact the Evergage Client directly to ask for this.  If you feel the Evergage Client is not responding satisfactorily to your request, please contact us [here.](mailto:%73%75p%70ort@%61pp%74%65gi%63.com)
