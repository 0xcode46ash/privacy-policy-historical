**Snap's Privacy Philosophy**

Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. Because we gather certain types of information about Snap users, we want you to understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.

**Information that Snap Gathers**

Snap gathers two types of information about users: 

1) Personal data, provided through voluntary registration.  
2) Aggregated data, which tracks users as a whole.  


**Personal data** may be requested when you sign up for Snap's personalized services or register for contests, sweepstakes or other promotional programs offered on our service. We ask for this in order to provide you with the best Web experience possible. This information might include member name, password, age, gender, ZIP code and/or country information. Except as described below, it is not disclosed to parties other than Snap and its parent companies in any way that personally identifies you without your prior permission. 

**Aggregated data** , which tracks Snap user activity as a whole rather than on an individual basis, is gathered through several methods. This tracking data follows Snap traffic in general, and is not used to identify you personally. 

Aggregated tracking information helps us to determine which areas of our site users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. Snap does not track what you read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We may disclose such aggregated information to third parties such as our advertisers and partners. 

**How Snap Uses Information**

Snap uses any personal information that's voluntarily given by you in order to enhance your experience, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the site or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users. Snap also uses information that you voluntarily provide in order to send electronic updates and to let you participate in polls and message boards. 

Snap will not disclose any information that personally identifies you to parties other than Snap and its parent companies without your consent. There are exceptions:   
1) When the purpose and manner of disclosure is clearly defined in advance.  
2) When we believe in good faith that disclosure is legally required or to protect our rights. 

**Contests and Sweepstakes**  
Snap occasionally offers contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information on a voluntary basis. These contests and sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws. The full rules and all information about such contests are clearly posted during the event, including how information gathered will be used. 

**Membership Services**  
To use Snap's membership services -- such as e-mail, My Snap and your personal custom portfolio -- you will be requested to register. During registration, you'll be asked to supply a member name and password, age, gender, zip code and/or country information. Snap shares this data with our service provider(s). For instance, the personal information that you provide to our e-mail service at Snap is shared with that company in order to retrieve your password when necessary. 

This data is considered highly confidential and is used only to retrieve your password when necessary. We use high-level encryption when sending data between Snap and our e-mail provider. 

**Search Terms**  
As a measure of user interest, we track search terms that are entered into our site. We create aggregrate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows you to receive advertisements that are most relevant to you. An advertiser will not receive specific information that you clicked their ad unless you voluntarily permit us to do so. 

**Cookies and Tracking**  
A cookie is a small data file that Web sites commonly write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file contains information that can identify you anonymously in order to track traffic patterns on our site. The data is encrypted for your added security. Snap uses cookies as a way to measure activity on the site in order to continually improve your experience. 

Cookies also provide you with a level of convenience -- since they "remember" your computer, they enable you to enter Snap sites as a member without having to log on each time, and they allow you to visit member-restricted areas of the site. 

Cookies don't identify you personally, but rather identify your computer when you visit our site. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. 

Your browser can be set to warn you before accepting cookies -- in this case, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You can choose to refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use Snap, but you will need them for customizable areas of the site such as local weather forecasts. Snap does allow users to clear cookies. 

**Electronic Newsletters**  
Snap offers free, electronic newsletters as a service to our users, based on a voluntary subscription. You will only receive a newsletter if you have requested it during registration to several areas of Snap or directly from our signup form. We do not share newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers or partners, unless you voluntarily permit us to do so when you register or sign up. 

**Snap Shops**  
Information you provide about yourself during a purchase through a store hosted by Snap is automatically provided to the owner of that store. This includes credit card and personal contact information. Each of these online merchants carry separate privacy and data collection practices from Snap, and Snap does not have any responsibility for their practices. For more information about a policy from a merchant, go to the store's home page and look for the company profile. 

**Message Boards or Discussion Areas**  
Please remember that while Snap does not share any personal information gathered during registration to Snap Message Boards or Discussion Areas, any postings to message boards or discussion areas become public information. Use caution when posting.

**Snap Content Providers, Advertisers and Partners**

Snap will not provide your personal information to anyone outside of Snap and its parent companies except in the limited circumstances mentioned, and only then with your consent. For instance, the personal information you provide during registration to the Snap Finance center "powered by" Bloomberg will not be shared with anyone outside of Bloomberg. 

However, Snap cannot control the practices of other partners and advertisers. If you have provided personal information to a party or advertiser connected with Snap and have not been informed by Snap as to its purpose, contact them directly by going to their home page and looking for a company profile or information area. 

It is important to note that Snap contains many links to sites other than Snap, and that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as Snap. For instance, if you click an ad or a search result on Snap, this will take you away from Snap and to an entirely different site. This includes links from advertisers, content providers and partners who may use Snap's logo and/or style as part of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you, and as a result, may collect data and ask for personal information that Snap would not. 

**Kids and Privacy**

Snap requests that children under 17 do not submit or post any information to the site without a parent's or guardian's consent. However, we will not request or knowingly collect from a child any information online that can be traced to the child, such as an e-mail address, name, or information about the child's family. 

Unless a parent or guardian consents to such use in advance, Snap will not knowingly use information that a child provides to Snap for any marketing, selling or promotional purposes. 

**Changes to Policy**

Snap reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying guests of the existence of a revised privacy policy.

**Opt-Out Policy**

Snap gives you options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include: 

1\. Opting not to receive our electronic newsletters when registering for a site.   
2\. Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need for any information from our users.

**Correct/Update Policy**

Snap offers the ability to correct or change the information collected during your registration. The instructions for doing this can be found in our Help area under "Change Member Settings". You may change this information at any time and as often as necessary. If you're experiencing problems or have any questions about how our services work, contact us at [ support@snap.com](mailto:support@snap.com).

**Delete/Deactivate Policy**

You may unsubscribe to our electronic newsletter at any time via e-mail by following the instructions contained at the end of every newsletter. 

Currently, Snap does not offer a means by which to completely delete personal information established at the time of registration for any site. If you have questions about your information, please contact us at [ support@snap.com](mailto:support@snap.com).
