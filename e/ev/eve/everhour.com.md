## Privacy policy

**Information privacy**

Everhour (software developed by Weavora LLC) maintains reasonable security measures to protect your information from loss, destruction, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure. This helps to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and those you provide with authorized access.

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not and will not sell your personal information to third parties.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure due to the nature of the distributed network that is the Internet, and Weavora LLC is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from data gathered by unauthorized access to our Services from hacking, social engineering, or otherwise circumventing our security measures.

Refer to your tasks directly from Everhour when creating a new time entry and generate detailed time reports. Explore hours spent on tasks by any team member for any period of time.

**Billing information**

At the moment we do not collect any credit card information. Billing plans will be available later this year.

**Physical security and data protection**

Everhour is hosted on the secured cloud infrastructure provided by Rackspace Inc. Rackspace is the SAS 70 approved world hosting leader with 100% Network Uptime Guarantee and 24/7/365 support. All client and account data is written to multiple disks instantly, backed up daily, and stored in multiple locations. However, Weavora LLC does not offer service-level guarantees for services of Rackspace Inc.
