# Meeting Education Made Easy | CadmiumCD

Your information, privacy and security are our priority. We do not share or sell your data to anyone. CadmiumCD clients have exclusive rights and ownership to their data. This Privacy Statement explains how your personal information is gathered and used by CadmiumCD and the affiliated partner companies listed on our Web site. 

## Data Gathering & Use

CadmiumCD collects information via users who voluntarily email requests for assistance/more information, and who submit similar requests via online forms, as well as through marketing automation software via user-approved tracking cookies.

We use this data to send users information about our CadmiumCD services and technology tools, as requested. 

CadmiumCD also may collect information via user-approved tracking cookies to run Google Adwords remarketing campaigns. Third-party vendors, including Google, use these cookies to serve ads based on your past visits to our websites, and to show CadmiumCD ads relevant to you on sites across the internet.  
To opt out of this please visit Google's Ads Settings at http://www.google.com/settings/ads.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell or disclose user or client information to third-party vendors.

In rare cases, we may be required by law to disclose personal data to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, to comply with a legal process such as court order, subpoena or search warrant.

CadmiumCD does not transfer or use client data in anyway without your express consent. Access to production databases is limited to the fewest possible points. 

## Physical Security

Our network is hosted at a facility in Chicago, Illinois, that provides 24/7 physical security. Badge/photo ID access screening and biometric access screening are used for additional security. Motion sensors and security breach alarms protect sensitive security areas. Security personnel monitor via cameras installed throughout the facility.

## User Authentication

CadmiumCD clients are each provided with a unique account, accessible only by a unique username and password. Each user is responsible for their own usernames and passwords and agrees not to disclose usernames or passwords to any third parties and to keep them secret at all times.

## Application Security

CadmiumCD's applications are secured through session management, which times-out users after a specified amount of time of inaction while within an application.
