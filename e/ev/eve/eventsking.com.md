EventsKing Privacy Notice  
Updated as of February 27, 2008

The EventsKing Privacy Policy describes how EventsKing and its subsidiaries treat personal information when you use EventsKing services, including information provided when you use EventsKing. In addition, the following describes privacy practices specific to EventsKing. To understand how we treat the information you give us as you use EventsKing, you should read this policy.  
Personal Information

* Non-Account Activity. You can watch videos on EventsKing without having a EventsKing Account or a EventsKing Account. You can also contact us about a particular video without having a EventsKing Account or a EventsKing Account.  
* Account-Related Activity. Certain other activities on EventsKing—like uploading videos, posting comments, flagging videos, or watching restricted videos—require you to have a EventsKing Account or a EventsKing Account. We ask for some personal information when you create a EventsKing Account or a EventsKing Account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. A EventsKing Account allows you to access many of our services that require registration.  
* Usage Information. We may record information about your usage, such as when you use EventsKing, the channels, groups, and favorites you subscribe to, the contacts you communicate with, the videos you watch, and the frequency and size of data transfers, as well as information you display or click on in EventsKing (including UI elements, settings, and other information). If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your account. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. \"Web Beacons\") in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.  
* Content Uploaded to Site. Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your playback or profile pages, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others.

Uses

* If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the EventsKing Sites, we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the general and personalized features and functionality of the EventsKing Sites, and to process any flagging activity or correspondence you send to us.  
* Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload videos or send messages through the EventsKing Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. Any videos that you submit to the EventsKing Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public. If you have enabled Active Sharing, other users may see that you, as identified by your account name (not your email address), are watching the same video.  
* We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major EventsKing Site changes or for customer service purposes).  
* We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the EventsKing Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, analyzing, and processing user preferences and trends, as well as user activity and communications.

Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites

EventsKing allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the EventsKing Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the EventsKing Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.

EventsKing does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks EventsKing to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the EventsKing Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. EventsKing\'s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers subsequently shared with EventsKing is maintained and dealt with by EventsKing in accordance with this privacy policy.

Currently, EventsKing has relationships with the following third-party ad servers or ad networks:
