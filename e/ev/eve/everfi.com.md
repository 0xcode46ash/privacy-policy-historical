Last Modified: September 14, 2014 

We at EverFi, Inc. ("EverFi," "we," "us," "our”) care tremendously about how personal information is used and shared. We take your privacy seriously. 

EverFi owns or operates the EverFi websites (herein, the “Websites”) listed HERE, in Section 14 of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to these Websites and any of services available through these Websites (collectively, the " **Service**.") This Privacy Policy describes how EverFi collects, uses and discloses the information it collects via the Service. It does not apply to how a Sponsoring Entity (defined below in Section 3.) uses or discloses any information related to Service users. 

In some instances our platform may be accessible via a third party website, including that of a Sponsoring Entity. This Policy does not apply to the information collection practices on any such third party website or of a Sponsoring Entity, but only to the information EverFi collects on the Websites and Service. 

By using the Service, you agree that EverFi will handle your personal information as described in this Policy. Your use of our Services, and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this Policy and our Terms of Service, located at <https://platform.everfi.net/registration/login>.

**Personally Identifiable Information or (“PII”) We Collect Directly from You**. We collect PII about users of our Service. Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a particular user or can be used to contact a particular user. Such information may include a Service user's name, address, email address, as well as information about their employment, education history, demographic information and other optional information. EverFi may collect PII directly from a user, such as during the registration process and when users communicate with us, and from a user's Entity (as defined below). 

**Activity Information**.

This information may include user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, device type, time stamp, referring URL and other log file information; user activities within the Service; aggregate and statistical information regarding overall server/visitor traffic and navigation patterns for the Service.

EverFi will extract all individual pieces of personally identifiable information (such as name, e-mail address, and, if appropriate, login ID) from any survey data before sharing such data with any end-user including any Sponsoring Entity (as defined below) or any other third party, unless we have your consent to share survey data in identifiable form with your Sponsoring Entity. 

**Contests and Advisory Boards.** Through the Service, users who are over the age of majority in their state of residence (18 years old in most states) have the option to enter contests or to participate in advisory panels. Such users may be required to enter additional information to participate. This participation is completely optional; users are not required to participate in such activities in order to use the Service. 

**Payment Information**. For users who register and take our e-commerce online courses, credit card information and payments are collected and processed by a third-party payment processor. EverFi websites that accept direct payments include http://www.outsidetheclassroom.com and http://www.everfi.net.

**Sponsoring Entity.** If you access the Service through, or are granted access to the Service by a school, school district, college, university, person, institution or other organization (a "Sponsoring Entity"), we may share the information we collect about you with the Sponsoring Entity or its representatives. Such information may include, but will not be limited to: course progress/completion; assessment scores; email address; user ID/identifying tag or username (if applicable); additional data the Sponsoring Entity or its representative requests. 

**Social Media Sharing**. If a user chooses to share information such as assessment scores through social media outlets, such as Facebook and Twitter, third parties may receive information about a user’s performance on the Service, such as information about badges and prizes received in connection with the Service. 

**Third-Party Sponsors.** EverFi works with third-party sponsors to bring the Services to some users free-of-charge. In such situations, we may share de-identified or aggregate user information with our sponsors. We may also aggregate the information that we collect from users of our Service to create demographic profiles and performance profiles regarding the progress of users who use the Service. 

**Legal Disclosures.** We may disclose a Service user's information (including personally identifiable information) where we believe that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process. We may also disclose PII where we believe it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Terms of Service for our Service, to detect fraud, for assistance with a delinquent account, as evidence in litigation in which we are involved, or to protect the safety and/or security of our users, the Service or the general public. 

**Service Providers.** We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers to provide specific services related to the Service, such as hosting and maintaining the Service, providing credit card processing and fraud screening, and developing applications for the Service and e-mail services. 

**Business Transfers.** We reserve the right to transfer information (including PII) to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of EverFi or any of its Affiliates (including as part of a bankruptcy proceeding). 

**Affiliates.** We may disclose PII about Service users to our affiliated companies. Our affiliates' use of your PII will be in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

**Aggregate and De-Identified Information**. We may also provide aggregate, anonymous or de-identified information about users and the Service for marketing, research, analytics, marketing and other purposes. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit the Service, the demographic breakdown of our registered users of the Service, and the test results and progress of users. 

**4) Cookies and Analytics**

We, and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Service. 

**Cookies**. We, and our service providers use cookies to track visitor activity on our platform. A cookie is a text file that a website transfers to your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We, and our service providers use cookies to track user activities on our Services, such as the pages visited and time spent on our Services. Most browsers allow users to refuse cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Many of our Services will not function properly with cookies disabled. 

**Do-Not-Track Signals.** Users opt-in to our Services through enrollment and registration. Our platform does not recognize “do-not-track” requests; however, we do not track your activities after you leave our platform. 

**Local Shared Objects.** We may use local shared objects (“LSOs”), such as Flash LSOs to store your preferences and to personalize your visit. LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable LSOs through your web browser. You may be able to manage Flash LSOs in particular; for more information or to learn how to manage your Flash LSO settings, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions. 

**Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies**. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages and cannot be disabled through your browser. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Services to, among other things, track the activities of users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage. We, and our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded. 

**Third-Party Analytics.** We, and our service providers may use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Services. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our services. We use these tools to help us improve our services, performance, and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. We do not share your personal information with these third parties. 

**5) Other Websites**

Our Service may contain links to other websites not owned or operated by EverFi, and may provide Service users with access to other websites and services. This may include providing users with the ability to share and automatically post updates (including updates about badges and prizes received in connection with the Service) through social media outlets, such as Facebook and Twitter. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third party websites or services. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every website you visit. 

**6) Protecting Your Information**

EverFi has multiple security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control. However, no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. We believe that we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online. 

**7) Public Area**

The Service may feature various community areas and other public forums (the "Public Areas") where users can share information or post questions for others to answer. These Public Areas are open to the public and should not be considered private. We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy. We are not responsible for the results of such postings or for the accuracy of any information contained in those postings. You should think carefully before posting any information in any Public Area. What you post can be seen, disclosed to or collected by others and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or predict. As with any public forum on any website, the information you post may also show up in third-party search engines like Google. 

**8) Communications**

We may send periodic informational emails to you. You may opt out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email (or contacting us at privacy@everfi.com). Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your EverFi account or any services you have requested or received from us. 

**9) Amending your Information**

If you mistakenly post personal information in a Public Area you can send us an email to request that we remove it by contacting us at privacy@everfi.com. If you would like to amend your profile information, you may log in to your account and do so or email us at privacy@everfi.com. You should understand that in some cases, we may not be able to remove or update your information and such information may remain viewable in archived or cached version of the Service. We may also retain copies of such information in our systems or databases. 

**10) International Transfers**

EverFi is a U.S. company and all the information we collect will be transferred to, stored and processed in the U.S., as well as other locations where we have affiliates and service providers. The U.S. and other jurisdictions to where we transfer your information may not offer an equivalent level of data protection as in your home country. Your data also may be subject to access by law enforcement and other government entities, including courts and tribunals in accordance with the laws applicable in those jurisdictions. You expressly agree to the cross-border transfer of your personal data as described in this paragraph. 

**11) Our Commitment to Children's Privacy**

EverFi is committed to protecting the privacy of children. Please see our COPPA Privacy Policy for our guidelines concerning the collection of information from children under the age of 13. 

**12) Amendments**

EverFi may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of changes to this General Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of those changes. IF we make any material changes that affect information we have previously collected by you, we will endeavor to provide you with notice, such as notice via email or within the Service.
