Last modified September 20, 2013 

EverFi, Inc. of Washington D.C. (“EverFi” “we” or “us” or “our”) is committed to providing an informative and engaging educational technology platform for all of its users. EverFi feels strongly about protecting the privacy of its users. EverFi owns or operates the websites listed at the following link EverFi [Website List](https://web.archive.org/legal/website-list "Website List"). 

These websites and the services available thereon and other services we may make available from time to time (together with associated and successor websites and services) are referred to as the “Service”. This General Privacy Policy informs you of the policies of EverFi, regarding information that we collect from users of our Service. This General Privacy Policy applies only to information that we collect.. 

BY USING THE SERVICE OR PROVIDING ANOTHER PERSON WITH ACCESS TO USE THE SERVICE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE SERVICE OR PROVIDE ANOTHER PERSON WITH ACCESS TO USE THE SERVICE. CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICE FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF CHANGES TO THIS GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY MEANS THAT YOU ACCEPT THOSE CHANGES. 

**1). How We Collect and Use Information:**

In addition to the specific uses described below, EverFi generally uses the information collected through the Service to provide the Service to users, to help us understand who uses the Service, for internal operations such as to improve the Service, and to contact users for customer service and billing purposes. We may use a Service user’s information to send a welcoming email that may confirm the user’s user name and password. Without requiring the user to “opt-in”, we may send the user electronic newsletters and marketing materials, contact the user about products, services, information and news that may be of interest to the user, and provide the user with targeted feedback. In addition, if a user identifies himself or herself to us by sending us an email with questions or comments, we may use the user’s information (including personally identifiable information) to respond to the user’s questions or comments, and we may file such questions or comments for future reference. We may also use the information collected to send important service announcements and updates regarding the Service or, if applicable, about billing account status. You will not be able to unsubscribe from these service announcements and updates as they contain important information relevant to the use of the Service. 

We may also use the information gathered through the Service to perform statistical analysis of user behavior or to evaluate and improve the Service. We may link some of this information to personally identifiable information for internal purposes or to improve users’ experience with the Service. All information collected may be used or shared by EverFi as described in this General Privacy Policy on a worldwide basis. 

**Personally Identifiable Information**

Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a Service user or can be used to identify or contact a Service user. Such information may include a Service user’s name, address, email address, and telephone number. EverFi may collect personally identifiable information during the registration process from a user or from a user’s Entity (as defined below). This information allows EverFi (and the schools, organizations, and teachers who use our products) to track the use of our educational technology platform and Service. Although not a requirement, we may also collect and use email addresses to help with customer support calls and to allow users access to self-service functions such as password reset features, etc. 

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

Non-personally identifiable information is information, any single item of which, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact a Service user, such as demographic information (like age, profession, current location, zip code, or gender). Non-personally identifiable information may also include user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, user name, test results, test scores, survey data, and statistical data involving the use of the Service. We collect nonpersonally identifiable information during the registration process and also through the use of cookies and log files, as described in this General Privacy Policy. One type of non-personally identifiable information that we collect is aggregate information regarding overall server/visitor traffic and navigation patterns for the Service, which is collected for basic system monitoring. Web servers collect this type of basic information automatically as part of Web log processes. This tracking helps us improve the design and content of our Service. As further described below, we also collect aggregate information concerning the demographics and progress of our users. 

**Surveys**

EverFi collects data from surveys, including demographic information to help us evaluate the effectiveness of our courses. EverFi will extract all individual pieces of personally identifiable information (such as name, e-mail address, and, if appropriate, login ID) from any survey data before sharing such data with a user’s Entity (as defined below) or any other third party. 

**Contests and Advisory Boards**

Through the Service, users who are over the age of 18 have the option to enter contests or to participate in advisory panels. Such users may be required to enter additional information, such as an email address. This participation is completely optional; users are not required to participate in such activities in order to use the Service. 

**Use of Cookies**

As a standard practice, EverFi uses “cookies”. EverFi may use cookies on its Service to ensure the integrity of the registration process and to personalize course content. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on a user’s hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies are uniquely assigned to a user and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie. Only session cookies are used, which means that the cookie will only exist on a computer while a user is on the Service. If a user logs out or closes his or her browser window, he or she will delete the cookie. No information persists. Please note that if you refuse the EverFi cookie (by turning cookies off in your browser or by clicking “don’t accept” if you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies), the offerings, features, and resources of the Service will not work. In order to use the Service, a user may need to decrease the security or privacy settings of his or her browser to accept cookies. 

**Collection of IP Addresses**

As with many sites, an IP address is visible to us when users visit our Service. An IP address is a number automatically assigned to an individual’s computer whenever he or she is connected to the Internet. EverFi will only use IP addresses when users sign up for the Service to help diagnose problems with our server. 

_Note regarding credit card information:_ For users who register and take our e-commerce online course through the http://www.outsidetheclassroom.com website, credit card information and payments are collected and processed by a third-party site managed by Verisign. We do not collect or store any credit card information on our servers.

**2). SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES:**  

_**Service Users’ Entities** _

We may share all information about a user’s use of and performance on the Service with the school and school district and/or other organization (an “Entity”) that provides the user with access to use the Service, including the Entity’s representatives, such as teachers and administrators.

         Course progress/completion

_**Teachers and Administrators** _

_**Third-Party Sponsors** _

EverFi works with third-party sponsors to bring our courses to some Entities free-of-charge.  We only share non-personally identifiable user information with our sponsors.  We, however, may aggregate the information that we collect from users of our Service to create demographic profiles and performance profiles regarding the progress of users who use the Service. This aggregated information may be shared with third parties in the form of group statistics. 

_**Laws and Legal Rights** _

We may disclose a Service user’s information (including personally identifiable information) if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process. We may disclose personally identifiable information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms-of-use "Terms of Use") for our Service, to detect fraud, for assistance with a delinquent account, or to protect the safety and/or security of our users, the Service or the general public. 

_**Third Parties Generally** _

We may provide to third parties non-personally identifiable information about Service users, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of the Service. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit the Service, the demographic breakdown of our registered users of the Service, and the test results and progress of users.  The third parties to which we may provide non-personally identifiable information may include affiliates, actual or potential commercial partners, students, customers, sponsors, Entities of Service users, licensees, researchers and other similar parties. 

_**Outside Contractors** _

We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, "Outside Contractors") to provide specific services related to the Service, such as hosting and maintaining the Service, providing credit card processing and fraud screening, and developing applications for the Service and e-mail services. In the course of providing services to us, these Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected through the Service, including users’ personally identifiable information. 

_**Sale of Business** _

We reserve the right to transfer information (including personally identifiable information) to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of EverFi or any of its Affiliates, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this General Privacy Policy. 

_**Affiliates** _

We may disclose information (including personally identifiable information) about Service users to our Affiliates. For purposes of this General Privacy Policy, "Affiliate" means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with EverFi, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to Service users that we provide to our Affiliates will be treated by those Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this General Privacy Policy. 

**3). Other Websites:   **

Our Service may contain links to other websites and services not owned or operated by EverFi and may provide Service users with access to other websites and services. This may include providing users with the ability to share and automatically post updates (including updates about badges and prizes received in connection with the Service) through social media outlets, such as Facebook and Twitter. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any websites or services other than the Service. We encourage you to be aware when the Service links to other websites or services and to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every such website and service. This General Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected through the Service. 

**4). Public Area:**

The Service may feature various community areas and other public forums (the "Public Areas") where users can share information or post questions for others to answer. These Public Areas are open to the public and should not be considered private. We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy. We are not responsible for the results of such postings or for the accuracy of any information contained in those postings. 

Any information you share in a Public Area (including personally identifiable information) is by design open to the public and is not private. You should think carefully before posting any information in any Public Area. What you post can be seen, disclosed to or collected by others and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or predict. As with any public forum on any website, the information you post may also show up in third-party search engines like Google, Yahoo, MSN, and Bing. If you mistakenly post personal information in a Public Area you can send us an email to request that we remove it by contacting us at privacy@everfi com. You should understand that in some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information. 

**5). Protecting Your Information:**

The Service may feature various community areas and other public forums (the "Public Areas") where users can share information or post questions for others to answer. These Public Areas are open to the public and should not be considered private.

We are not responsible for the results of such postings or for the accuracy of any information contained in those postings.
