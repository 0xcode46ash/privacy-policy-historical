# Everyclick Privacy Policy

## **1.1 Introduction**

This document details what information we may hold about you, why we hold it, and how we may use it. If you represent a charity, you may also wish to refer to our [charity privacy policy](https://ea.everyclick.com/cookies).

This policy applies to Everyclick search and donations products ([www.everyclick.com](https://www.everyclick.com/)). 

We also operate Give as you Live ([www.giveasyoulive.com](https://www.giveasyoulive.com/)) - your Everyclick account can also be used to access Give as you Live, and a number of features from Give as you Live are included as part of the Everyclick website. Therefore you should also read the [Give as you Live privacy policy](https://www.giveasyoulive.com/privacy) for anything relating to those features. 

If you use any other products and services from Everyclick Ltd, additional policies may apply - you should check the relevant website(s) for those additional policies. 

This policy was last updated on 23rd May 2018.

##  **1.2 What information we store about you**

When you sign up to Everyclick, the only personal information we require are your name and email address. You also choose a password and select a charity to support. 

If you sign-up using Facebook, we will store a link to your Facebook account and require you to provide the requested permissions (access to your full name and email address). If you deny or retract these permissions then you will be unable to access your account. 

Within your account, you may optionally provide more personal information such your date of birth and gender. You may amend or remove this information at any time via [your account](https://fundraisers.everyclick.com/myaccount).

When making a donation, you are asked if you wish to add Gift Aid (if eligibility criteria has been met). Doing so involves providing us with your full name and address so that your eligibility for Gift Aid can be verified by HMRC. 

We store information regarding your activity on Everyclick, including searches, donations, Give as you Live activity (including searches and tracked purchases), and technical information such as your browser and IP address. We may use external tools, such as Google Analytics, to collect such information. 

If you enter a competition we run, then we may store information entered on the competition entry form. This is usually just an email address and name. 

## **1.3 How we may contact you**

By signing up to Everyclick, you agree to our [terms and conditions](https://web.archive.org/about-everyclick/terms-and-conditions). This includes giving us permission to send you promotional emails relating to Everyclick and other products and services we may offer (including Give as you Live) - unless you opt out at the point of sign-up or at a later date. 

Examples of such promotional emails include the release of a new feature/product, Give as you emails, or the launch of a competition. 

You can opt out of our promotional emails using the unsubscribe link that is included in all such emails, or via your [Everyclick account](https://fundraisers.everyclick.com/myaccount).

Your opt-out status does not affect the sending of transactional emails - for example emails confirmation a donation or emails relating to accessing your account. 

If you contact us, for instance via phone or email, you give us permission to contact you relating to your query. Doing so will not result in your details being added to any promotional email lists. 

If you are not signed up to Everyclick, but have entered a competition then you will agreed to our [competition terms and conditions](https://www.giveasyoulive.com/terms/competition). This includes giving us permission to send you promotional emails relating to Everyclick and other products and services we may offer (including Give as you Live) - unless you opt out at the point of entry or at a later date.

If you have provided us with your contact information in person, for example at an industry event, then we may be able to contact you including sending a follow-up email or promotional emails. This will depend on the circumstances in which you provided your information. 

## **1.3 How we use your information**

The personal information we store may be used to tailor our service to you. This could involve us displaying different content on our website based on your data and preferences. 

We may also use your information - including personal, technical and usage data - for internal purposes such as statistical analysis. This is so that we can understand how our products and services are being used and to aid the decisions we make. 

## **1.4 How data may be shared**

We may publicly display basic personal information - for example showing a list of recent donations including your name and amount raised. You have the option within [your account](https://fundraisers.everyclick.com/myaccount) to change your publically-displayed name or to change it to 'Anonymous'. If you don't have an account and are making a donation payment, you may choose to not have your name publically displayed. 

You can decide if your personal information is shared with your supported charity. This can be done at the point of sign-up or later via [your account](https://fundraisers.everyclick.com/myaccount). The charity may therefore contact you and you will be subject to their own privacy policy. 

Please note that if you change your charity, your information will still be accessible to your previously supported charities. If you withdraw you consent, we will contact you to establish your wishes regarding previously shared data. 

The payments of donations are handled by our payment partner, therefore information relating to your donation (including payment card details, billing address and name) are securely passed to the payment partner for the sole purpose of taking the donation payment. 

If you request Gift Aid with your donation, then the information you supply (including name, address and donation value) will be shared with HMRC so that they can verify your eligibility for Gift Aid. 

If you are making a donation through UK Skydiving, then this information will also be passed to UK Skydiving so that they can manage the process of requesting Gift Aid. 

Donation data is made accessible to charities. Unless you requested for your details to be withheld, this data includes your name, email address, full address and amount donated. Give as you Live donation data may also be accessible to charities, however this will be in an anonymised and aggregated form, and is therefore unaffected by your choice of consent. 

When you use the Everyclick search engine and click on a search result, you are taken to another website where different terms and conditions, privacy policies, and cookie policies will apply. 

We may use a variety of tools and services - including, but not limited to, email marketing tools, Facebook advertising tools, and Google advertising/analytical tools - which may involve uploading and processing your data in order to provide a service to us (and only us - i.e. not to other parties). 

In the result that our company is sold, the ownership of data is transferred to the acquiring company. If this happens, we will endeavour to inform you about this and of your rights. 

Outside of these scenarios, we do not pass your personal data onto any third parties without your explicit content. 

## **1.5 Cookies**

Cookies are small text files placed on your computer by websites. The information cannot be seen by any other websites (so the information is secure) and is used by us to provide features to aid the use of our services. 

Cookies need to be enabled in order for you to access your account, whilst the tracking of Give as you Live donations relies upon cookies. Therefore, the intended use of Everyclick requires cookies to be enabled. 

For more information about how we use cookies, please see our [cookie policy](https://web.archive.org/cookies).

##  **1.6 Security**

We endeavour to follow best practices and fulfil all legal obligations with regards to the security of your data and personal information.

In order to access your account with us, you choose a password which is used in combination with your email address to sign in with. It is also your responsibility to keep your password safe. If you use Facebook to log in to your account, the same applies to your Facebook access details. 

We cannot take responsibility if you voluntarily or involuntarily enable someone else to access your account and gain access to any personal information stored. 

You may change your password at any time via [your account](https://fundraisers.everyclick.com/myaccount).

##  **1.7 Compliance with GDPR**

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an EU regulation that applies from 25th May 2018. It re-enforces and adds to existing regulations (such as the Data Protection Act (DPA) 1988) regarding how we use your personal information and communicate with you. As a company, we seek to be in compliance with these regulations.

Access to data - you have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you. You may request this by [contacting us](https://everyclick.zendesk.com/). We do have the right to charge a fee or refuse unreasonable requests. 

Consent - at the point of sign-up, you can optionally give us consent to communicate with you via email. You can change your decision at any time via your [Everyclick account](https://fundraisers.everyclick.com/myaccount). In addition, all promotional emails contain an unsubscribe link. Likewise with your option to share your basic personal data with your supported charity, you may grant this consent at the point of sign-up and change your decision later via your account.

"Right to be forgotten" - you have the right to request that we remove any personal information we hold about you. If you wish for us to remove your personal data, please [contact us](https://everyclick.zendesk.com/). Please note that this will result in the closure of your account, whilst non-personal information may be retained in an anonymised form. Following your initial request, we will contact you to verify your identify and to establish your wishes regarding any data previously shared with charities or retailers. Please note that we will be unable to fulfil the request without this verification.
