# Everyclick Privacy Policy

IMPORTANT: BY SUBMITTING PERSONAL DATA TO US YOU AGREE THAT IT MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED BELOW. 

## Introduction to Privacy Policy 

This Privacy Policy describes our current policies and practices with regard to Personal Data collected by us from you. The term "Personal Data" refers to information about you personally. Because of changes in the law and the changing nature of technology, our data practices will change from time to time. If and when our data practices change we will (as soon as practicable) post the changes on our website to notify you of the changes. We encourage you to check this page frequently.

## Use of Personal Data 

We will always abide by the Data Protection Act 1998. When we ask you for Personal Data, we tell you the purposes for which we will process that data. These purposes include the following: 

  * We may contact you to inform you of new services we will be providing, or events or information we think will be of interest to you. 
  * We may use your Personal Data for marketing purposes and market research. 
  * We may use your Personal Data internally to help us improve our services and to help resolve any problems. 
  * We may supply your data with the charity you have chosen to support.
  * We may supply your data with a Corporate Partner that referred you to Everyclick.
  * When you build a fundraising page, we will pass on your name, email address, phone details (if entered), post code (if entered) to the charity you have chosen to support, so that they can thank you. 



## Emails from Everyclick

When signing up to Everyclick you can agree to receive emails from us. Examples of emails you may receive include general news about Everyclick and our products, tips on fundraising and updates from Polly Gowers OBE, our CEO. If you become an active user of our other products, you may receive additional types of emails, such as weekly emails containing retail offers if you become an active user of our Give as you Live product.

You can opt out of such emails when you create your account, by using the opt out links provided in our emails, or by updating your email preferences within your [account.](https://fundraisers.everyclick.com/myaccount)

In addition, you will receive notification emails whenever you make a donation or pledge to a charity or a fundraising page, if a fundraising page you have created has received a donation, or if you make a purchase through the Give as you Live links that are integrated with Everyclick search results. As these emails are considered transactional emails, you will continue to receive them even if you opted out of our promotional emails.

We do not send junk email or spam. Your information will not be passed onto any third parties other than your chosen charity, as detailed above.

## Cookies 

A "cookie" is a small computer file which is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not. When you first use our website we will send a cookie to your computer so that the next time you log on using the same computer we will recognise you and, if you have selected a charity, we will know which charity it is without having to be told again. If you choose not to accept it, or if you later delete it or disable cookies generally, we will not have this information and some of our website's functionality may not be available to you. Please note that the use of cookies is an integral part of our click fraud detection and prevention policy and procedures.

## Data Integrity and Security 

We strive to maintain the reliability, accuracy, completeness and currency of Personal Data in our databases and to protect the privacy and security of our databases. Our servers and our databases are protected by industry standard security technology.

The employees who have access to Personal Data have been trained to handle such data properly and in accordance with our security protocols. Although we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorised disclosure, alteration or destruction of data, we take all reasonable steps to prevent this from happening. 

## Data Access and Corrections

Upon receipt of your written request and enough information to permit us to identify your Personal Data, we will disclose to you the Personal Data we hold about you. We will also correct, amend or delete any Personal Data that is inaccurate and notify any third party recipients of the necessary changes. If you wish to access or correct your Personal Data or if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or concerns about the way we process your Personal Data, please write to our data protection officer at Basepoint Business Centre, Crab Apple Way, Vale Business Park, Evesham, Worcestershire, WR11 1GP or e-mail us at [privacy@everyclick.com](mailto:privacy@everyclick.com).
