We use Redeye's software to carry out statistical analysis of page use, page interactions and paths through www.evanscycles.com. This is known as 'web metrics'. We also capture a customer identifier when Evans Cycles registered customers log on to www.evanscycles com. This information allows us to identify customers and more accurately understand their behaviours and needs.

Redeye has access to this along with other Evans Cycles data, to help increase the relevancy of our direct marketing.
