## Collection of Personal Information

When placing an order at SoftwareSituation.com, you will be asked to submit personal information such as your name, address, email address, phone number, credit card or debit card information. This information is used to process and complete your order. Additionally, the IP address used to access the site will be logged along with the dates and time of access. Your information is collected for the sole purpose of processing your order. Your information is not shared with outside parties except that which is necessary to process and complete the order, e.g. credit card verification, order shipment.

## Security

We have appropriate electronic, physical and management policies to secure and safeguard your information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and protected. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing".

## Business Operations, Law Enforcement and Legal Actions

We may release your information without prior notice when we believe it is appropriate to prevent fraud; to comply with law or to cooperate with law enforcement activity or other governmental request; to respond to subpoenas, court orders or administrative agency requests for information; to enforce our policies; to protect the rights, property and safety of our business and of others; or when required or otherwise permitted by law. For example, we may share information with law enforcement if we reasonably believe that someone is using or attempting to use our site for illegal reasons. If there is a sale or merger of the company, division or business unit that operates this site, we may also transfer the information we have collected in connection with such sale or merger.

OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer. OEM items are brand new, but they're meant for experienced users and system builders. They don't come with retail packaging, accessories or manuals, although documentation and software can typically be downloaded from the manufacturer's website.

## OEM Software is Non-Refundable

OEM items come sealed in a plain box or plastic sleeve packaging with little to no documents or instructions. Since there is no retail packaging to hide the serial number or key code, we cannot allow refunds for OEM products.

## Who Can Use OEM Software?

OEM software is intended for system builders only and cannot be transferred to another PC once it is installed. Purchasers of this software are required to comply with the terms of the System Builder License, including responsibility for providing all end-user support.

SoftwareSituation.com is not responsible for system or software incompatibility, and incompatibility issues do not qualify software as damaged or defective. Please ensure you are ordering the correct product for your computer.

## OEM Terms

Use of OEM System Builder Channel software is subject to the terms of the Microsoft OEM System Builder License. This software is intended for pre-installation on a new personal computer for resale. OEM System Builder Channel software requires the assembler to provide end user support for the Windows software and cannot be transferred to another computer once it is installed.

SoftwareSituation.com only sells genuine, new, original software that activates with the manufacturer. We do not sell used, copied, or trial software. It is your responsibility to install OEM software correctly. The manufacturer does not support OEM installations or SoftwareSituation.com for OEM installations.
