# Evonik Rexim SAS and Evonik Rexim (Nanning) Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd - Privacy Statement

Modern information and communications technologies are playing an ever-increasing role in the activities of organisations such as Degussa Fine Chemcials. That is why we take the protection of your privacy, together with the personal data that you provide us with, very seriously. It goes without saying that we comply with the stipulations of the Federal Data Protection Law. In the paragraphs below we specify the data that we, i. e. Degussa Exclusive Synthesis & Catalysts and its subsidiaries, gather if necessary and explain how we treat such data.

**Which personal data are gathered and processed?**  
You can visit our web-sites without having to provide us with any personal data. We will be informed only of the name of your Internet service provider, the web-site from which you are visiting us and the web-site of ours that you are visiting. Personal data are gathered and processed only if you use particular services and a login is required. The menu will notify you of this in detail.   
We do not collect personal information about our visitors from other sources, such as public records or bodies, or private organizations. In addition to that, Degussa Exclusive Synthesis & Catalysts does not automatically log personal data nor we link information automatically logged by other means with specific data about specific individuals. 

**For what purposes do we gather and process personal data?**   
Since we are constantly endeavoring to achieve a continuous process of improvement in both our service offerings and your own experience with our web-sites, we conduct statistical analyses of the above-mentioned general data. To do this, however, we also need to be aware of your own personal opinions and your environment. That is why you will be asked to provide additional information at several points. The information in question is voluntary and will, of course, be treated confidentially.  
If you use services which are on offer, it is generally the case that only the data that we require to render those services will be gathered. If we ask you for more detailed data, the information in question is voluntary. The personal data are processed exclusively for the rendering of the requested service and for safeguarding our own justified commercial interests.

**Are personal data forwarded to third parties?**   
We will forward your personal data to third parties only as far as is absolutely necessary for the rendering of the requested service. Beyond that we will neither disclose, permit the use of, sell or otherwise market your personal data to other companies or institutions without receiving an express declaration of consent from you. Other conditions shall apply if we are obliged by the law or a court judgment to disclose and communicate the data.

**Cookies**  
In some areas of our web-sites we use cookies. These are data pads which enable us to make our services available to you on a more individual basis during your visit. We do not use cookies to gather personal data. If you would like to be informed about the use of cookies on your browser, or if you would like to rule out their use, you should activate the appropriate browser settings.

**Children**   
Personal data pertaining to children are not knowingly gathered or used in any way. We are not generally aware of the age of the users of our web-sites. We have, however, taken no specific steps to give special protection to such data.. 

**Security**  
We have taken technical and organizational steps to protect the personal data which you provided against loss, destruction, manipulation and unauthorized access. All of our employees and third parties who are involved in data processing are obliged to observe the Federal Data Protection Law and the confidential treatment of personal data.  
We reserve the right to amend this declaration at any time. This declaration shall not justify any contractual or other formal right vis-Ã -vis or by order of one party.
