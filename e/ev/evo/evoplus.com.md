Privacy Policy 

**Privacy Statement**

EvoPLUS.com respects your privacy. Our purpose in collecting information from you is to help us provide you with better service, such as notifications about special offers and promotions. We will not willfully disclose any individually identifiable information about you to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in this privacy statement. Furthermore, we do not specifically target children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly collect, without parental consent, individually identifiable information from such children.

**What Information Do We Collect?**

From time to time we may request that an entity making application for an account with evoPLUS.com provide us with certain personal information (such as their name, email address, etc.) in connection with various services offered on our site. We do not collect any personal information except when an individual specifically and knowingly provides such information. When we request information, we explain how this information may be used and give you an opportunity to request that the information not be used for those purposes. We also give you an opportunity to opt out of future communications from us.

**Cookies**

For account management purposes and like most sites, evoPLUS.com uses cookies. Cookies are data files stored on your computer that identify you as a unique user. Cookies enable us to track user trends, preferences and patterns to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Most browsers permit users to refuse cookies or to be notified before a cookie is accepted. You can visit our site without using cookies.

**Links to Other Sites**

EvoPLUS.com contains links to other sites. These sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Since we do not control these sites; we are not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or content of such sites.

**With Whom Do We Share Information?**

EvoPLUS.com may share non-personal and non-personally identifiable information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only divulge aggregate information, such as how often the average user visits evoPLUS.com. EvoPLUS.com may partner with other parties in connection with the various services offered on our site, such as credit card processors or email delivery services. In such instances, we may share limited personal information that is necessary for the third-party to provide these services. These companies are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose.

EvoPLUS.com may also provide personal information when disclosure may be required by law (e.g., subpoenas, search warrants and court orders). We may also determine that such action is reasonably necessary to protect a party's rights, property, or well-being. This action may include exchanging information with relevant organizations and authorities for the purposes of fraud detection or protection, or in other situations involving suspicious or illegal activities.

**Business Transfers**

In the event of a transfer of ownership of evoPLUS.com, such as acquisition by or merger with another company, a user's personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.

**Consent and Changes to this Privacy Statement**
