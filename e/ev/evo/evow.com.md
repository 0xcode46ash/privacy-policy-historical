Also, if you access our Service from a third party social platform, such as Facebook, we may share non-personal information with that platform to the extent permitted by your agreement with it and its privacy settings.

**_With Whom Do We Share Information?_**

_Personal Information_.  In the normal course of business we act as the data controller and processer, but we may share some of Your Personal Information with our affiliates and with third parties acting on our behalf or as permitted or required by applicable privacy laws.

To opt-out of cookies that may be set by third party data or advertising partners, please visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>.

_Onward Transfer and Consent to International Processing_.  We are a growing corporation with users and operations in multiple countries, including the European Union.

In addition, we may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. If we disclose Personal Information to a third party or to Plenty of Fish employees outside of Canada and the United States, we will seek assurances that any information we may provide to them is safeguarded adequately and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the requirements of applicable privacy laws.

**_If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use_ , please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal data, including sensitive data, by us from your region to countries which do not have data protection laws that provide the same level of protection that exists in countries in the European Economic Area, including the United States. By providing your personal information, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Policy.**

**_Do Not Track Browser Signals and Advertising Choices_**

_Advertising Opt-Out_.  Some third-party advertising companies with whom we partner may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies and provides information about this behavioral advertising practice (www.networkadvertising.org).

However, you may be able to change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser, as described above.

**_Third-Party Websites_**

Our Service may contain links to other websites or Internet resources which are provided solely for Your convenience and information. When You click on one of those links You are contacting another website or Internet resource. We have no responsibility or liability for, or control over, those other websites or Internet resources or their collection, use and disclosure of Your Personal Information. We encourage You to read the privacy policies of those other websites to learn how they collect and use Your Personal Information. 

**_How Do I Access or Correct my Personal Information?_**

**_How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?_**

The Service limits access to your personal information. We have physical, electronic, and administrative procedures in place to protect and help prevent unauthorized access and use of personal information.

No data transmissions through the Internet or via mobile devices, or even the physical transfer of information, can be guaranteed to be completely secure. We cannot fully eliminate all security risks associated with personal information. We do not ensure or warrant the security of any data or information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
