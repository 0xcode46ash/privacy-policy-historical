**What information do we collect?**

To order a product, you will need to set up an account. To set up an account, we will need to know your name, email address, billing and shipping address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. You will also be asked to create a special username and password so that you may access your account in the future (and so you don't have to re-enter all your information again). When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. When you submit a "Contact" request or a "Nutritional Support" request via our website, we will need to know your name, email address and question, however we DO NOT store any of this information on file. We simply need this information so that we may respond to you and answer your question. After a response is given to you, your request information is destroyed. If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about a product offered on our site, we ask them for their friend’s name and email address. eVitamins will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. eVitamins does not store this information. It is only used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. If a user chooses to submit a product review, we will need to know your name, email, review description and location so that we may store it to display with your review. You can choose not to have your name, email or location posted to your review, although we will still need to collect the information to keep on file with your review for internal records. Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**How do we use it?**

We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about new eVitamins services, important functionality changes to the Web site, special offers we think you'll find valuable and most importantly just to see how you are doing.

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders (FedEx, DHL, USPS, or UPS), and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies may receive personally identifiable information to help us process your order. These companies will not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. Your personal data will be stored on file for as long as your account is active. An account will become inactive if an order is not placed within 24 months using that account. If your account is inactive it will automatically be deleted from our records.

This can usually be done at the account manager or by [contacting](https://www.evitamins.com/email.asp) our Customer Support Department. Or, contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed at the bottom of this page.

**What you should know!**
