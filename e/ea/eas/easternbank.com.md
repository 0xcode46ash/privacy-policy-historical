PRIVACY POLICY

_At Eastern Bank, Keeping Customer Information Secure is a Priority_

At Eastern Bank the basis of each customer relationship is trust. Since you have chosen to do business with Eastern Bank, we are obligated to honor that relationship with great care, particularly with the information that you share with us. We believe that customer privacy should not be compromised. At the same time, we want to offer you a broad array of financial products and services that will help you attain your financial goals. Accordingly, we want you to understand what information we gather and how we use it.  
  
What Information We Collect  
“Nonpublic personal information” is nonpublic information about you that we obtain in connection with providing a financial product or service to you. For example, nonpublic personal information includes information regarding your account balances, account activity, and payment history. We collect the following types of nonpublic personal information:

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other loan and account forms; 
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others; and 
  * Information we receive from third parties, such as credit bureaus. 



To Whom We Disclose Information  
We may share nonpublic personal information about you with companies related to us by common control or ownership (“affiliates”) and, in certain circumstances, with third parties that are not members of our corporate family (“nonaffiliated third parties”). Our “affiliates” include financial service providers, such as investment advisors and insurance agents. These disclosures enable us to provide you with superior customer service and a broad range of financial products and services that we believe add value to your relationship with us.

What Information We Disclose To Third Parties  
Under the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, we are permitted to share information about your transactions with us (such as your name, address, loan and account balances, and payment history) with our affiliates.

We also disclose the following types of information to financial institutions with which we have joint marketing arrangements (such as insurance companies and agencies, banks, and securities brokers):

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other loan and account forms, such as property or automobiles you own; 
  * Information about transactions with us, our affiliates, or others, such as your account balance, payment history, and parties to transactions; and 
  * Information we receive from credit bureaus, such as your creditworthiness and your payment history. 



Finally, we may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties in certain other circumstances as permitted by law, such as third party vendors that assist us in servicing your loan or deposit account, to government entities in response to subpoenas, and to credit bureaus. 

_**We do not share customer information with nonaffiliated third parties for their independent use in marketing their products.**_

Our Policy With Respect To Former Customers  
We follow the same privacy policies and practices for former customers as are described in this notice.

Our Security Procedures  
We will safeguard any information you share with us. In addition, we will limit the collection and use of nonpublic personal information to the minimum required to provide you with superior products or service. We restrict access to your personal account information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.

Nonaffiliated Third Party Web Sites  
Eastern Bank is not responsible for the products and services, policies, security or content of nonaffiliated third party web sites that you may link to from easternbank.com. You should review the terms of use and privacy policy of these nonaffiliated web sites before providing confidential information.
