### DoubleClick cookie

The DoubleClick cookie is used by Google in the ads served on the websites of its partners, such as websites displaying AdSense ads or participating in Google certified ad networks.

When users visit a partner's website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser.
