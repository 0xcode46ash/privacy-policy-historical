# Eastman.com Privacy Policy

privacy policy

**Information Collection and Use**  
Eastman respects the privacy of visitors to our website and is committed to maintaining all reasonable precautions to assure the privacy and security of this web site. At times, we may ask you to provide information about yourself or your company in order to better serve you. We will only use this information to support your customer relationship with us. This information may include name, title, company, address, phone number, email address, and other relevant data. We do not require this information to obtain access to many areas of our site. We do, however, require it to download certain product information or to access specified sections of our site. In both cases, this information allows us to contact you should the need arise or to respond appropriately to your request for services.

Eastman may use this information in an aggregated form to measure number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, and other relevant statistics. Eastman collects this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site. Our website may contain "links" to other sites, and we cannot and are not responsible for maintaining your privacy once you leave our site. We attempt to only link to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy.

We may also make use of website "cookies" to help you use our services more easily and to help us continuously improve our website and our service to you. A "cookie" is a small data file that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive to help our website "remember" information about you when you return to our website, such as your preferences for our website or account id's. Our cookies cannot read data off of your hard drive, read cookie files created by other websites or track any personal information about you. You may be able to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.

**Registration**  
Some segments of our website require that you be a registered user before you are granted access to those segments. During the registration process, you are required to provide contact information (such as name, company, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address). This information will be stored in the United States and used both to contact you if necessary and to control access to restricted parts of our website.

**Other Data**  
In addition, certain on-line technical applications require the entry of technical data such as product formulations or properties. Eastman does not monitor nor save such information to storage devices unless the application provides for the storage of such information as a service to you. In that case, such information will not be accessed or viewed by Eastman personnel except for those activities required for the maintenance and upkeep of our website. We will take all reasonable precautions to assure that no such information will be provided or divulged to other third party personnel.

**Security**  
Eastman takes reasonable precautions to keep all information obtained from our online visitors secure against unauthorized access and use and we periodically review our security measures in an effort to ensure your privacy. We will not, without your permission, give, sell or provide to others for a fee any information that you provide to us, except as set forth herein. We will always ask for and obtain your permission before sharing your information with anyone other than Eastman Chemical Company subsidiaries and affiliates, unless we believe in good faith that the law requires our Company to do so.

If you wish to verify any voluntary information collected about you, or if you wish to be removed from our site database, please contact us at [ebushelp@eastman.com](mailto:ebushelp@eastman.com).
