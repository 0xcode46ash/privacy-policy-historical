For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, the controller of all information collected on this website is:

In those circumstances the Operator will be the controller of the information for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998. The Operator may be required to collect such information from you by law or otherwise. Please refer to the privacy policy of each Operator  for more information on this.
