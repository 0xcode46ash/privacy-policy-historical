For session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your computer’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Your browser’s help file contains information and instructions for removing persistent cookies. Session ID cookies may be used by EasyHosty to track user preferences while the user is visiting the website. They also help to minimise load times and save on server processing. Persistent cookies may be used by EasyHosty to store, for example, whetheror not you want your password remembered, or other such information.

Like most standard Websites, EasyHosty use log files.

However, none of the information stored in the EasyHosty log files, including but not limited to IP addresses, is linked to personally identifiable information. 

### How EasyHosty uses this information

EasyHosty may use the personally identifiable information collected by EasyHosty to contact customers regarding products and services offered by EasyHosty and, to the extent the User has agreed to it, by its trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business partners. EasyHosty may also use this information for research purposes regarding the effectiveness of Website services, marketing, advertising and sales efforts. EasyHosty will not in any way share this information with a third party either for free or by selling it, unless you specifically authorise such disclosures. 

### Disclosure of Information

EasyHosty may also disclose aggregate, anonymous, data based on information collected from Users to investors and potential partners. In such cases, statistical information only will be disclosed and personally identifiable data will be kept strictly confidential. In case EasyHosty is sold, the information collected from users may be transferred to the new owners.

EasyHosty may from time to time engage third parties, including its own subsidiaries and affiliated companies, to preserve, analyse or otherwise store or manipulate data received by EasyHosty from its customers. In all such cases, such third party service providers will be required to treat all such data with the same degree of care as EasyHosty and they will be prohibited from disclosing such data to any other person or party, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Policy. 

### Special Offers and Updates

EasyHosty customers and users will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and possibly a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of users, EasyHosty presents the option to not receive these types of communications. 

### Service Announcements

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement, if, for instance, a service is temporarily suspended for maintenance. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. 

### Legal Disclaimer

Though every effort is made to preserve your privacy, EasyHosty may need to disclose personal information when required to by law. If it is deemed necessary that such action needs to be taken, EasyHosty will comply with judicial proceedings should a court order or legal process be served on EasyHosty.
