### Privacy Policy

When you create an account you will be prompted to enter personal information including: name, address, phone number, etc. The information we collect when you create an account allows us to ensure prompt delivery, and to improve our content delivery. EasyClosets does not share names, postal addresses and demographic information with any other company. All information is kept strictly confidential and internal to EasyClosets.   
EasyClosets uses a cookie, a small file stored on your computer, to allow you to store items in your shopping basket and design portfolio and retrieve them when you re-visit our web site. The cookie, by itself, does not tell us (or anyone else) who you are, your e-mail address, or any other personal information.

  


### Additional Parts Policy

We are happy to sell you additional parts should you decide you want to modify an organization system purchased from our company, (ie: shelves, closet rods, drawers, baskets or hardware). Just call our Post Sales Team at 800-910-0129 option 5 during business hours. We can verify your previous order with your name, invoice number or email address and gladly assist you with your parts order!

  


### Returns Policy

You may return new, uninstalled items within 30 days of delivery for a full refund. We'll also pay the return shipping costs for the particular part if the return is a result of our error (you received an incorrect, miscut or defective item). Because of the custom nature of each order we sell, if you decide to return your order for any other reason, the return shipping costs are your responsibility.

Any order returned to us because delivery is refused will result in a 20% shipping and restocking fee.

A Return Material Authorization (RMA) must accompany all returns. Please call 1-800-910-0129 to request an RMA be sent to you via email.

  


### Security Statement

At EasyClosets we take the privacy and security concerns consumers have when using the Internet very seriously. We want to make your experience at EasyClosets a pleasant one. To accomplish that goal, in addition to creating a web site that has volumes of easily-navigable and current content, we also utilize secure technology to prevent any unauthorized access to your information and we pledge to not share any information you provide to us with anyone outside of EasyClosets.

 **Secure Transaction Security**  
EasyClosets uses secure socket layer (SSL) technology to keep your personal information safe. All of your ordering information (name, address and credit card number) is encrypted for maximum security. This prevents anyone from reading any of your information as it travels to our ordering system. To protect you even further, EasyClosets does not retain any credit card numbers within our ordering system. Approval is immediate and we do not add your credit card number to any of our databases. This forces you to re-enter your credit card number when you make a future purchase, but it also prevents anyone from gaining access to your information. 

**Still Prefer to Order Via Phone**  
If you prefer, we provide Customer Service support at 1-800-910-0129. Our representatives can view your shopping basket and design portfolio and complete the sale over the phone. 

**Your Credit Card Guarantee**  
In addition to our guarantee and secure technology, our credit card partners offer programs to further protect you against any possible fraud when shopping online at EasyClosets.com.
