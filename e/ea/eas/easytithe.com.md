Easy tithe has been a great resource and has help drive people to our new website. As a result they are telling there friends about it and our traffic has increased immensely. Just in online giving we have gone from 700.00 the first month to over 5,000.00 in the 3rd month. Thanks Easy Tithe!

EasyTithe has been the simplest, most powerful integration for online giving to our website. Our church is approximately 250-300 people and its been one of the best tools yet. Its far better than anything weve seen or tested before, and now, we couldnt do without it. Highly, highly recommend this program!!
