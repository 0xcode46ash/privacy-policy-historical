In addition to cookies, our site uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, which may include web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of web sites. EazeWork also uses these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our web site, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our web site.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

At times EazeWork will use third party vendors and we may need to transfer your Personal Information to them. In all such cases only the relevant information will be transferred to them and they will also be compulsorily required to follow our Privacy and Security Policy. 

We may transfer your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: 

  1. conform to the edicts of law or comply with legal process served on EazeWork
  2. protect and defend the rights or property of EazeWork, or

### How We Use Information Collected

The information collected is used by us to set up the services for our users and their organizations. In addition, we may also use the information to contact you for discussions regarding our applications or the services we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. We will also be using the email address to send information regarding updates to the applications and services or company news, and a email newsletter. Additionally, we also ask customers to provide an email address while registering for the services, in order to send a username and password.

You will have the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of receiving communications from EazeWork when you elect to use our software product on a free-trial basis, or purchase / upgrade an account. Further, when you receive the requested communication, you are given the opportunity to unsubscribe from receiving any future communication or to change your information.

### Data Security

At EazeWork, protection of customer data and applications is of highest priority. We take all precautions to keep your data safe and secure. The platform is hosted at the state of the art data centre, using the latest firewall protection, intrusion detection systems, SSL encryption and proprietary security products and managed by a team of experts to keep customer data stored in a high security facility where even physical access is audited and controlled. All data is regularly backed up to ensure that your data is never lost, even in the worst of calamities. 

EazeWork provides a unique user name and password to each user that must be entered each time a User logs on. A session "cookie" is issued only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session. The session "cookie" does not store either the username or password of the user or any other confidential user and session information, but instead implements more advanced security methods based on dynamic data and encoded session IDs. In addition, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects your information using both server authentication and data encryption while accessing our site using Google Chrome version 3.0.195.27, Microsoft Internet Explorer version 6.0 or higher, Safari version 4.0.2 and Mozilla Firefox 1.5 or later. 

Questions regarding the security practices of the Services should be emailed to [support@eazework.com](mailto:support@eazework.com).

### Data Retrieval

We keep a daily backup of all our data and also have multiple instances of the Production environment to provide redundancy in case of a failure at the Data Center. We also provide a Archival service using which you can get your critical data mailed to you at a pre-determined frequency. At any point of time you can also export all your data into xml formats.

### Changes to this Security and Privacy Policy

EazeWork may amend this policy from time to time, the amended policy will be posted at the same link as it is posted now. It is the responsibility of users to ensure that they periodically visit this link to read the updated policy.
