**How We Use and Protect Personal Information**

At GE PeGetawaysTM, protecting your privacy is very important to us. GE Perfect Getaways is offered by Signature Agency, Inc., a unit of GE Financial and a part of the General Electric Company ("GE"). We value your trust. We want you to understand what information we collect, how we protect it, and how we use it. We treat nonpublic NPI ("NPI") that identifies you with respect and in accordance with this Privacy Notice. NPI is vital to GE PeGetaways in meeting our goal to provide you with products and services.

This Privacy Notice is designed to provide information regarding how we collect, use and disclose NPI we gather when you visit us on the World Wide Web. This Privacy Notice currently is applicable only to our United States customers and visitors when they interact with us on the Internet.

**Our Privacy Notice**

This is our Privacy Notice: 

  * We will describe what NPI we collect, how we protect it, and how we may use it.
  * We will maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect NPI we obtain about our customers.
  * We will require servicing companies to whom we disclose NPI to adhere to our Privacy Notice.
  * We will also comply with any other state requirements that relate to the use and protection of your NPI.

Please read on for more details. This Privacy Notice includes examples of the types of NPI we may collect and with whom we may share NPI. These examples should not be considered a complete list of our information collection or sharing practices. As used in this Privacy Notice, "you" and "your" refer to an individual consumer and "companies" may include individuals.

We may obtain NPI to provide you products and services you have requested, to determine if you qualify for products or services, and to service your membership.
