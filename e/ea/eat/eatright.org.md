#### External Links

EATRIGHT.ORG may contain links to other external Web sites that do not fall under the EATRIGHT.ORG domain. EATRIGHT.ORG is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such external Web sites. The Academy does not endorse the content, products or services on other Web sites.

#### Pop-Up Advertising

Some visitors have reported that advertisements for products, such as diet pills, pop up on their computer screens when they log onto EATRIGHT.ORG. The Academy has nothing to do with these pop-up ads and does not sanction or control them in any way.

These ads are triggered by software on the viewer's computer that may have been unwittingly installed as part of a free software package. The most common case is with music and file sharing software that is given away free to consumers.  
After installation, the software keeps track of the sites the user logs onto and when the person goes to any site that is on a special list, an ad pops up. Advertisers pay for this and select the sites they want their ads to be associated with.  
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics does not approve of this practice and has written to government leaders requesting that legislation be passed to prohibit it.

#### Security

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

#### Tell Us What You Think

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics welcomes your questions and comments about privacy. Please e-mail [webstrategy@eatright.org](mailto:webstrategy@eatright.org).
