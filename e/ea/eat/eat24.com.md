**GENERAL**

Eat24, LLC ("Eat24" or "we" or "us" or "our") respects the privacy of its users ("user" or "you") whether they use our website located at www.Eat24.com, including other media forms and media channels related or connected thereto, and our mobile applications (collectively, the "Website") to order food from local restaurants, to advertise food for sale or simply to view the Website. The following Eat24 privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") is designed to inform you about the types of information that Eat24 may gather about or collect from or about you in connection with your use of the Website. It also is intended to explain the conditions under which Eat24 uses and discloses that information, and your rights in relation to that information. 

**GATHERING, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**_Users of the Website Generally_**

Like most website operators, Eat24 automatically gathers from Website users non-identifying information of the sort that Web browsers and mobile devices, depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes may include a user's Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, and the locations of the Web pages the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website. 

Eat24 uses this information, as well as other information described in this Privacy Policy, to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all features of the Website, to provide services and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions and otherwise to provide support to users, and to process and deliver entries and rewards in connection with promotions that may be offered from time to time on the Website. Eat24 also analyzes this automatically collected information to help Eat24 better understand how the Website is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage, Eat24 is able to better design the Website to improve users' experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. From time to time, Eat24 may also release automatically collected information gathered from Website users in aggregated forms, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website. Finally, Eat24 may use this information to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all features of the Website, to provide services and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions and otherwise to provide support to users, and to process and deliver entries and rewards in connection with promotions that may be offered from time to time on the Website. 

**_Cookies_**

A "cookie" is a string of information that a website stores on a user's computer, and that the user's browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the site. Eat24 uses Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each Website session, both to help Eat24 improve users' experiences and to help Eat24 understand how the Website is being used. As with other non-identifying information we gather from users of the Website, Eat24 analyzes and discloses in aggregated form information gathered using cookies, so as to help Eat24, its partners and others better understand how the Website is being used. Eat24 does not attempt to link information gathered using cookies to Personal Information. Eat24 users who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before accessing the Website, with the understanding that certain features of the Website may not function properly without the aid of cookies. Website users who refuse cookies assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality. 

**_Web Beacons_**

A "Web Beacon" is an object that is embedded in a web page or email that is usually invisible to the user and allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an email. Eat24 may use Web Beacons to count users who have visited particular pages, viewed emails, and to deliver co-branded services. Web Beacons are not used to access users' Personal Information, as described below; instead, they are a technique Eat24 may use to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information including cookie data, the time and date of a page or email view, and a description of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides. You may not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered mostly ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. 

**_Aggregated Non-Personal Information_**

We may share aggregated and thus non-identifying information we collect under any of the circumstances described above. We may also share this information with third parties and our affiliate companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Website and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-identifying information we collect with other non-identifying information collected from or by other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our Website and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any Personal Information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising. 

**_Location Information_**

We may obtain information about your physical location, such as by use of GPS and other geolocation features in your device, or by inference from other information we collect (for example, your IP address indicates the general geographic region from which you are connecting to the Internet). 

**_Third Party Cookies, Web Beacons and Buttons._**

We may display third-party content on the Website, including third-party advertising. Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Website. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may function as Web Beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party Web Beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by Eat24. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies. 

As one example, we use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data; Google provides some additional privacy options described at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. 

**COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**_Website Registration_**

"Personal Information" is information such as a name or email address that, without more, may be directly associated with a specific person. Eat24 collects a range of Personal Information from and about Website users. Much of the Personal Information collected by Eat24 about users is information provided by users themselves at the time they register with the Website and purchase food. That information may include your name, address, email address, and telephone number and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender, age, date of birth, username, hometown and other demographic information, and other potentially relevant information as determined by Eat24 from time to time. Users of the Website are under no obligation to provide Eat24 with Personal Information of any kind, although refusing to do so may prevent the user from using certain Website features. 

We may also periodically obtain both Personal Information and non-identifying information about you from other Eat24-affiliated businesses, business partners, contractors and other third parties and add it to our account information or other information we have collected. Examples of information that we may receive include: updated address information, purchase history, and additional demographic information. 

We may also offer you the opportunity to log in to the Website by using credentials you have established with a third party website or application (such as your Google account) (each such account, a “Connected Account”). In such cases, we do not obtain information from these Connected Accounts beyond the information you and the Connected Account service provider provide to us in connection with logging into our Website. 

**_Online Forums and Public Postings; Other Collections_**

Certain Personal Information we collect about users is provided to us as a result of those users' use of the Website. We provide areas on our Websites where you can post information and reviews about restaurants. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when general web searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose Personal Information on publicly-viewable web pages, that Personal Information will be publicly available and may be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. You assume all responsibility for any loss of privacy or other harm resulting from your voluntary disclosure of Personal Information. 

**_Eat24 Communications_**

We may occasionally use your Personal Information, including your name and email address, to send you notifications regarding new services offered by the Website that we think you may find valuable. We may also send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. Generally, you may opt out of such emails at the time of registration or through your account settings, though we reserve the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications. 

**_Eat24 Disclosures_**

Eat24 will disclose Personal Information or other information under the following circumstances: 

  * **By Law or to Protect Rights**. When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our Eat24, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements or policies, in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
  * **Direct mail partners.** From time to time we may share our postal mailing list with selected providers of goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive mailings from these providers, you may opt-out at the time you register for our Website, or at any time thereafter by going to your account settings or contacting us using the contact information below.  

  * **Marketing Communications**. Unless users opt-out from receiving Eat24 marketing materials upon registration, Eat24 will email users about products and services that Eat24 believes may be of interest to them and Eat24 also will provide users' email information to third parties, so that those third parties may directly contact users about additional products and services. If a user wishes to opt-out of receiving marketing materials from Eat24 or having their email information provided to third parties at any time after registration, users may do so by going to your account settings or contacting us using the contact information below. Even after opting-out, a user may continue to receive marketing emails from third parties to whom Eat24 already has provided the user's email information. Users will be responsible for directly contacting such third parties to request cessation of further marketing emails.
  * **Restaurants**. Whenever a user places an order for food from a restaurant, Eat24 will transfer all information to the restaurant necessary for preparing and processing the order. On occasion, this may include transferring credit card and other payment information in cases where a restaurant, rather than Eat24, is processing the payment. Users will need to contact restaurants directly to determine the privacy policies that apply to the information that Eat24 transfers to the restaurants.
  * **Third Party Service Providers**. We may share your Personal Information, which may include your name and contact information (including email address) with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our Website. We may also share your name, contact information and credit card information with our authorized service providers who process credit card payments, or enable such authorized service providers to interact directly with you to collect such information. These service providers may have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purpose.
  * **Business Transfers; Bankruptcy**. Eat24 reserves the right to transfer any or all information, including any Personal Information, in its possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of Eat24's assets. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred Personal Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are given notice of that new privacy policy and are given an opportunity to affirmatively opt-out of it. Personal Information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor organization.



**_Changing Personal Information; Account Termination_**

You may at any time review or change the Personal Information we maintain about you by going to your account settings or contacting us using the contact information below. Upon your request, we will deactivate or delete your account and contact information from our active databases. Such information will be deactivated or deleted as soon as practicable based on your account activity and accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law. To make this request, either go to your account settings or contact us as provided below. We may retain in our files some Personal Information to prevent fraud, to troubleshoot problems, to assist with any investigations, to enforce our Terms of Use and to comply with legal requirements as is permitted by law. Therefore, you should not expect that all Personal Information about you will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. Additionally, we keep a history of changed information to investigate suspected fraud with your account. 

**_General Use_**

We use the Personal Information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Website to: deliver the products and services that you have requested, manage your account and provide you with customer support, communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us, our affiliate companies or other third parties, develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on our Website and other sites, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, measure consumer interest in our services, reward you for the ads you watch, inform you of updates, customize your experience, detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity, enforce our Terms of Use, and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.

We may use financial information or payment method to process payment for any purchases made on our Website, enroll you in the discount, rebate, and other programs in which you elect to participate, to protect against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business. 

**CONTESTS, GIVEAWAYS AND SURVEYS**

From time to time, Eat24 may offer Website users the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways and other promotions. Any information submitted in connection with such activities will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time to time, Eat24 may also ask Website users to participate in surveys designed to help Eat24 improve the Website.
