# Privacy Policy

In general, you can visit this Web site without telling us who you are or providing any personal information.  
 

If you voluntarily provide information, Eaton, its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Eaton") may use that information to send you products, information or services. In order to do this, we may when necessary share information with business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal authorities or government. In connection with a transaction, we may contact you for a customer satisfaction survey.  
 

Please read the following policy to understand how your information will be treated and used at this site. This policy may change from time to time, so please revisit this page periodically.  
 

 **Disclosure and Use of Personal Information**  
Eaton does not sell, trade, rent or allow others to use your information outside of Eaton other than as noted above.  
 

We may disclose information to appropriate legal authorities in special cases when we believe in good faith that such release is necessary:

  * to comply with the appropriate country law,
  * to identify or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our conditions of use and terms of service,
  * to legally enforce or apply the terms of this user agreement,
  * to protect the rights, property, both tangible and intangible, or safety of Eaton or other third parties.



  
Eaton Corporation plc is an international company. As such this site has users from all over the world. Any information you give us through this site may be transmitted to servers outside the country where the information is entered, and may be used, stored and processed outside the country where it was entered. Eaton is not responsible for the handling of information by servers of third parties. We may use certain information gathered from this site to compile demographic data about our users, sales, traffic patterns and related site information. If provided to third parties, this demographic data will NOT include any personally identifiable information.  
 

Web sites that are linked to this site and visited by a user from our site may have different policies and terms and conditions for use. Eaton is not responsible for the privacy practices or terms and conditions of these other sites.  
 

 **Security**  
Eaton uses appropriate reasonable measures to protect personal information. We use physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard your data. However, just as in the physical world, "perfect" security does not exist on the Internet. Even though Eaton intends to protect your information, Eaton does not guarantee that communications with our site or access to your personal information will never be improperly accessed by third parties.  
 

 **Ordering**  
When you place an order using Eaton's online product catalog services, the credit card information you submit will be transmitted in a secured format using secure server software (SSL) that encrypts this information. (Your credit card information will be submitted to the credit card institution for processing using the credit card company's secure server software or security measures.)

When you become a Registered User, we ask for your name, e-mail address and other information to assist us in processing your order. You will be asked whether you would like to receive e-mail messages regarding our products, promotions or other topics which may be of interest to you. We will only send such messages with your prior consent. You may review and update the information that you provide by using a personalization form on the same site you used to become a registered user.

A cookie is a small data file sent to your browser from a Web server to be stored on your hard drive that allows easier access the next time the same page is visited. For example, a cookie is sent when you register or sign in to this site. This site may use cookies to store information from forms you fill out to create a user profile so that you do not have to re-enter the information each time you visit.

An IP address is a number used to identify computers so that data, such as Web pages, you request can be sent to you. Our Web server automatically collects IP addresses for purposes of administering our system and to help us diagnose problems. We do not use the IP address for any other reason.

By using our Web site, you consent to the guidelines outlined in this policy.
