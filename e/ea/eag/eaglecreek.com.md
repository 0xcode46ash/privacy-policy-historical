**Eagle Creek's Privacy Policy**

Eagle Creek considers the responsible use of personal information to be a critical element in enabling the Internet to reach its full potential as a serious tool for personal and professional activities. As the Internet expands and improves our lives in a number of ways, Eagle Creek is committed to respecting your privacy.

In general, you can visit www.eaglecreek.com without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. 

There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name, home or business address, e-mail address and product information. Eagle Creek will seek to let you know before we collect any personal information from you over the Internet. Some examples of when we may need information are if you choose to register your product's lifetime warranty online at the Eagle Creek Web site, enter a contest, or choose to subscribe to one of our mailing list services. When you choose to give us personal information over the Internet that we may request, Eagle Creek will endeavor to let you know how we will use this information. Eagle Creek will also seek to take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us.

In general on www.eaglecreek.com, IP addresses (the individual address of a computer) are logged to track a user's session while the user remains anonymous. We analyze this data for certain trends and statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there. In general, we do not link your IP addresses to anything personally identifiable to you. If a service is offered where session information is not anonymous, Eagle Creek will provide notice of the practice and an opportunity to say "no thanks."
