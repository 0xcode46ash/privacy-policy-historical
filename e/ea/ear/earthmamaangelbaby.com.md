# Earth Mama Angel Baby Privacy Policy

### Notice

Earth Mama Angel Baby® has written this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. We use your Personal Information to help you quickly find goods, services or information on the site. We track all users who visit this site and use that data to analyze for trends and statistics. The data we collect is archived and only used for informational purposes within Earth Mama Angel Baby and is never sold, rented, leased, or given to any other company. Our site uses an order form, a gift registry, and a birth plan for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information such as their names, email addresses, and billing and shipping addresses. This information is used to send orders, information about our company, the birth plan, and to facilitate Earth Mama Angel Baby's ability to market our product.

We use non-persistent cookies on our site to control shopping carts. These cookies are temporary and will be removed when you close your browser window. You can completely restrict the use of cookies on your computer by turning "cookies off" on your computer's browser. However, if you choose to do this, you will not be able to order products from Earth Mama Angel Baby's shopping cart.

Any information that we collect is never sold, rented, traded or leased to third parties.

The security of the information that you provide to us is very important to us. Hence, we have taken several measures to protect your information. All transactions involving sensitive information, such as your credit/debit card number, are conducted using an SSL (Secure Socket Layer protocol) connection. This connection provides increased security to the information that is transmitted to our website. We will only use your credit/debit number for the processing of our payment. Other sensitive information that we may collect will not be disclosed to third parties unless we are required to do so by law.
