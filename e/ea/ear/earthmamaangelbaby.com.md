Earth Mama Angel Baby™ has written this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. We use your Personal Information to help you quickly find goods, services or information on the site. We track the domains from which this site is visited and use that data to analyze for trends and statistics, and then discard it.

We use non-persistent cookies on our site to control shopping carts. These cookies are temporary and will be removed when you close your browser window. You can completely restrict the use of cookies on your computer by turning "cookies off" on your computer's browser. However, if you choose to do this, you will not be able to order products from Earth Mama Angel Baby's shopping cart.

Any information that we collect is never sold, rented, traded or leased to third parties.
