**How Information Is Collected and  Used**

Registration Questions: When you sign up for a profile on  _EarnTheNecklace.com_ , you are asked a series of questions, including some that ask for personal information, like your full name, contact information, occupation, and physical appearance. We may also ask questions about hobbies and interests, preferences, and future goals. These questions are all designed to build your comprehensive profile, which works with our signature matching system to help us find you a suitable match and to deliver an optimal user experience.

Public Information: Unlike other web sites that make your profile searchable by posting it online,  _EarnTheNecklace.com  _stores this information in a confidential database. Personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information is never shared with anyone who is not a member of  _EarnTheNecklace.com_.

Delivery: Some of your personal information that you provide to us (e.g. your name, address, and/or e-mail address) is used for delivery purposes. From time to time, we may send you details regarding special offers and exclusive member opportunities. We use e-mail to communicate with you when we find a potential match, but if you would like to opt-out of receiving notice of special offers, exclusive member opportunities, and other messages that do not pertain to your individual membership, e-mail us at [dating@earnthenecklace.com](mailto:dating@earnthenecklace.com).

Tracking: Any time you visit  _EarnTheNecklace.com_ , our servers will automatically record information gathered from your browser, like your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, exit pages, referring pages, date/time stamp, time spent on each page, and number of clicks. We use this information to customize your user experience by personalizing content, appropriately fulfilling your service requests, informing you of updates to the web site and our services that may be of relevance to you, and letting you know about any new offers that you might be interested in. In the future, we may implement newer tracking technologies to monitor visitor activity on  _EarnTheNecklace.com_. The Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect any changes pertaining to how visitor and/or user activity is tracked.

Browser Information: Browser information will also be used by  _EarnTheNecklace.com  _to analyze user trends, efficiently administer the web site, prevent and stop fraudulent behavior, and collect information about our overall demographic. This tracking information may be shared with our partners, but only as a collective. Information on your individual visits will not be shared externally without your consent, unless we are required to by law, or to protect  _EarnTheNecklace.com_ , other members, or anyone else who may be at risk.

Cookies: To further enhance the user experience and improve member access,  _EarnTheNecklace.com  _uses cookies, which are small text files that a web browser stores on the hard drive of your computer. These cookies are used to recall user preferences and track visits to  _EarnTheNecklace_.com so that we can better understand your behavior on the web site to deliver online services with a more customized user experience. These cookies also track the number of visitors on the site, separating new and repeat visitors, so that we can plan for future development. Our cookies can only be read by our servers, and cannot execute any viruses or code. You are able to set your browser to disable cookies, however, doing this means you won’t be able to log on to your profile or use any of the member services available on  _EarnTheNecklace.com_. We cannot ensure that the web site will function properly without cookies, and you therefore assume full responsibility for reduced functionality should you set your browser to reject these cookies.

Mobile Analytics: As part of our analytics,  _EarnTheNecklace.com  _uses software for mobile analytics as well, which enables us to get a better understanding of how the site functions on mobile devices. This mobile analytics software may track information like how you interact with the site on your mobile device, events that may occur during your mobile session on the site, performance data, and aggregate behavior. The mobile tracking information we collect may be shared with our partners, but only as a collective. Information on your individual visits will not be shared externally without your consent, unless we are required to by law, or to protect  _EarnTheNecklace.com_ , other members, or anyone else who may be at risk.

**Disclosing Member Information When Required By  Law**

****_EarnTheNecklace.com  _reserves the right to disclose members’ profile information, including both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information, when required to do so by law or at the request of a trusted third party. You also acknowledge and consent that we can disclose the information you provide in your profile if we, in our sole discretion, believe that this disclosure is (1) in compliance with federal, state, municipal, and/or any other legal regulations, including requests from representatives of law enforcement, or any other legal process (regardless of whether or not disclosure is required by the applicable law); (2) defend or safeguard  _EarnTheNecklace.com_ ’s, or a third party’s, property or legal rights; or (3) protect the health and safety of you or another person.

**Disclosing Member Information to Potential Matches**

Our signature matching system is designed to use the information you provide in your profile to detect a compatible match.

If you’re selected as a potential match for another user, your profile may be sent to them for review; however, no contact information will be disclosed.

Although it is free to become a member of  _EarnTheNecklace.com_ , you will be required to pay a fee in order to communicate with other members. Upon consent and payment of the communication fee from both parties,  _EarnTheNeckalce.com  _will help to facilitate online communication.

**Third Parties**

_EarnTheNecklace.com_  may hire other companies and/or individuals to perform certain services or functions on our behalf, such as hosting web servers, studying data, marketing initiatives, credit card processing, customer service, technology assistance, and various other services. These companies and/or individuals might have access to some of your personal information, but only to the extent that is necessary for performing their required functions, and they are restricted from sharing this information with any other third party without our knowledge and written authorization.

We advise you to read all third party privacy policies.

**Online Transactions**

At this time, all payments to  _EarnTheNecklace.com  _must be made online through  _EarnTheNecklace.com_. All of the information you provide for these online transactions, including your credit card information and personal details, are protected with SSL encryption software before it is transmitted over the Internet.

**Accounts Payable**

It is up to you to ensure that your payments go through and that your account is in good standing.

To the extent that is permitted by law, you agree to not participate in or bring in any class action toward any claim, controversy, or disagreement you may encounter with  _EarnTheNecklace.com_  or any of its directors, employees, assignees, and/or servicers. This agreement does not prohibit you from waiving your rights to pursue an individual claim that is not part of a class action in binding arbitration as noted above. This agreement to not initiate or participate in any class action suits against  _EarnTheNecklace.com  _is an independent agreement that is applicable to the end of your membership.

**Business Sale**

In the event that  _EarnTheNecklace.com  _sells or acquires assets, your information may be included in the transaction, depending on the nature of the business transaction.
