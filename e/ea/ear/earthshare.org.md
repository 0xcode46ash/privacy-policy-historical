**Earth Share’s Donor Privacy Policy**

Earth Share values and respects its donors’ right to privacy. It affirms that its fund-raising practices protect against unauthorized use of its contributor lists, and permits no general telephone solicitation of the public. 

Earth Share utilizes donors’ personal information such as names, mailing addresses and email addresses only for purposes of donor acknowledgement and/or when an individual voluntarily provides this information and opts to join our mailing list. Earth Share does not share donors’ personal or contact information with any third party organizations for purposes of solicitation. 

For purposes of individual donor acknowledgement, Earth Share releases donor names, contact information and donation amounts to those [**Earth Share member charities**](http://www.earthshare.org/members_state_partners/members.html) that are designated by our donors, and only with the written consent of our donors. Earth Share strives to ensure that all donors who request acknowledgment receive appropriate acknowledgment in an orderly, timely and effective manner from the managing federation (either an Earth Share affiliate or the national office) and the recipient member charity (for designated gifts). 

Visitors to the Earth Share Web site remain anonymous. Earth Share does not require visitors to register or provide personal information to view the site. There are instances when site visitors are asked for additional information in order to provide requested services. For example, information will be requested when making an [**online donation**](http://www.earthshare.org/get_involved/do_your_earth_share.html) to Earth Share so that the gift may be properly processed and receipted. Earth Share’s online donors choose the personal information that Earth Share receives and can opt to remain anonymous. All credit card transactions are conducted over a secure server. 

Earth Share welcomes [**comments and questions**](mailto:info@earthshare.org) about this policy. We are committed to protecting your personal information, and will make every reasonable effort to keep that information secure.
