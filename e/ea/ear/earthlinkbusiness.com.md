You also may need to provide personal login and password information in order to access certain customer portals (i.e. to access your account information). Additionally, such information may be collected from your direct entry of the information via a web-based form or by you providing it through a "chat" interface. To better serve our customers, we also record your requests for information about the products and services offered by the EarthLink Business operating companies, as well as any responses you provide to us. We also maintain records of each customer's payment history and communications with our customer care department and other service support employees. This information may be used to contact you about your account and to inform you about available products and services. If you give us personal information about someone else, such as a work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so.

If we do not hear from you within 30 days after you first sign up for EarthLink Business service, we will assume you do not wish to opt-out. However, you can choose to opt-out at any time.
