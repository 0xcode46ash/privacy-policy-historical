INFORMATION COLLECTED   


Earndit uses both personal and non-personal information to provide you with a superior user experience and, as necessary, to administer our business. For example, we collect information that allows us to:

Submission of this information is entirely voluntary and may qualify you for additional rewards Points earning opportunities. In addition, Earndit records content, such as text, images, pictures, and profile information, which you submit or upload to the Site.

Earndit does not rent or sell members’ PII or program activity with anyone without a member’s expressed consent.
