# Privacy Policy | Earth Class Mail

This is the privacy policy applicable to the websites at [www.EarthClassMail.com](http://www.earthclassmail.com/ "www.EarthClassMail.com") and [www.RemoteControlMail.com](http://www.remotecontrolmail.com/ "www.RemoteControlMail.com"). We take very seriously the twin jobs of providing high quality service and protecting your privacy. The information below outlines the commitment we have made to protect your privacy. We do reserve the right to change this agreement, but any changes made will be posted here.

**I. Information Collected automatically during your site visit**

We collect the web page you came from, your browser's user agent string, any keywords you used in a search engine, your computer's IP address, the time and date, and the name of the page you visited.

If you provide information to us voluntarily, we may also collect all information prompted for during the sign-up process (name, email, address, phone, credit card, etc.)

**II. Information You Provide to Us**

We do not contact site visitors unless they have given us explicit permission to do so, have written to us, or have begun (or completed) the process of signing up for one of our services. Except in the unlikely event that we are required to do so by law, personal details will never be shared with any third party without your permission.

**III. How We Use Collected Information  
**

We collect information for site usage tracking, in order to enable us to monitor Web site traffic and usage patterns in order to continually enhance and improve the service we offer, and for customer source information. In this process, we may collect IP addresses (which indicate the location of your computer on the Internet) to ensure effective technical operations. 

**IV. Limited, Non-Identifying Information May Be Collected by Third Party Vendors  
**

**A. Cookies Used, But No Personal Information Collected  
**

We may work with a partner site, such as a vendor, to offer you certain services. The partners do NOT collect your identity or contact information from your visits to their Web Sites. For each visitor to a partner Web site, the visitor's computer reaches the partner via a particular IP (Internet Protocol) address, and the partner's servers automatically collect this IP address. 

Your browser sets Cookies (when enabled) that contain small amounts of data on your computer after a visit to any web site. Cookies assist the partner in tracking your activities from our web site to a partner's web site that you link to from our site. If you re-visit the partner's site directly, the partner is able to continue to track your activities on the site and reward us for referring you. The Cookies themselves tell the partner nothing about you personally.

Cookies are used in two stages of the partner tracking: when a banner image on our site is loaded on your Web page for viewing by you and when you click a banner on our site. The function of these Cookies is to provide the partner with information solely for the purpose of crediting us with referrals.

No information is obtained from you or your computer to generate the unique identifying number of you. The partner's servers automatically generate the unique number. None of the partner's Cookies are used to perform "User Profiling".

The partner may receive and record partial e-mail addresses only when you have voluntarily provided your identity and contact information through the partner's Web site. This partial e-mail address does not enable the partner to personally identify you.

If a Web site using the partner's tracking technology were to provide any personally identifying information to the partner beyond name and/or e-mail address, the partner would discard that information immediately.

**B. Disabled and Non-functioning Cookies**

The partners do not employ any technology or means of preventing you from disabling the acceptance of a Cookie. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but your browser may be set by you to disable this function. Some Web browsers or similar Internet navigating technology may not support (or consistently support) Cookie technology.

**C. Use and Disclosure of Data  
**

The partners do not sell or rent personally identifying information. The partner does not disclose personally identifying information to anyone without authorization. The partner uses anonymous user data to create and report the browsing, purchasing and/or lead form completion activities of anonymous users.

**V. How WE share information**

Other than what is specified in this document, we do not rent, sell or trade your personal or organizational information to others. We may provide aggregate statistics about sales, user traffic patterns, and other site information to third parties. These statistics will never contain personally identifiable information.

**VI. Links**

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**VII. Your Consent**

By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of information as outlined above, unless you timely notify us in writing otherwise. We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy, and will post any and all changes on this Web page. We will work to secure all information at all times; however, by using the site, you are voluntarily transmitting information to us, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security said information.

We welcome any [comments on this policy](https://web.archive.org/contact) .
