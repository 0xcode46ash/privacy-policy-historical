Earnware Corporation will make every effort to protect the private information that our customers and visitors provide to us. We also want you to have the opportunity to obtain interesting and useful information, products and services through Earnware and its affiliates. We greatly appreciate the support our loyal customers have shown, and we hope that this statement of policy serves to enhance your confidence in us and ensure a long and mutually beneficial relationship. 

This Privacy Policy describes how Earnware treats information received about you when you become an Earnware customer or when you otherwise provide information to us, for instance, by subscribing to Earnware services through our web site. For simplicity and clarity, we have broken the policy down into the sections below: 

**Customer Information**

It is Earnware's policy to respect the privacy of its customers. Certain bits of personal information may be necessary to provide and ensure proper quality service. Customer information is information such as name, address, telephone number, and credit card information -- information that identifies a particular individual or business. Earnware collects and stores customer information in the following ways: When registering for Earnware's services, customers must provide their name, address, telephone numbers, and credit card or other billing information. We also request that you provide us with a four-digit security code (such as the last four digits of you Social Security number) for added protection. 

Depending on the Earnware services you select, you will be assigned an 800/888 number and/or personal web site and/or an e-mail address. You will choose a security code that you must use to access and receive the services. We retain this information in our customer databases. 

**How We Use Customer Information**

The customer information that we collect during the registration process is or may be used to deliver service, for billing purposes, to resolve system challenges, and to maintain the security of proprietary information. If you send us correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your use of our services, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past use of the service, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Earnware Service Agreement. This information is kept on secure computers and is only available to select employees who need to access this information in order to provide quality service to the customer. We provide some information to companies that we use to perform certain functions for us -- for example, credit card numbers are sent to a credit card processing company for billing. These companies are not authorized to release this information to other third parties. We may use our customer database to distribute Earnware updates, upgrades or important notices to our customers. 

**Cookies**

Earnware uses "cookies". Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. We use cookies to store and retrieve session identifiers that correspond to a secure database containing each customer's user name and password information. This is designed to facilitate access by customers to Earnware member services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer information. 

**Changes to Earnware's Privacy Policy**

We may make changes to this policy from time to time. We will post changes to our Privacy Policy here, so be sure to check back periodically. We may also decide to notify our customers by email of significant changes. 

**Comments or Concerns**

If you have any comments or concerns about our Privacy Policy you may contact us at: [support@earnware.com](mailto:support@earnware.com)
