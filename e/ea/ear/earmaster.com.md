**EarMaster Privacy Policy**

EarMaster is committed to protecting the privacy of all information provided by our users. Please read the privacy policy below.

EarMaster collects information (such as address and e-mail address) about users during their registration for certain sections of our website. EarMaster will not disclose this information to third parties (unless we are required to do so by law) and will protect this information in accordance with our strict security and confidentiality standards. EarMaster does not offer or allow the selling of any user provided information to third parties.

Users may opt in to receive information from us by e-mail. Users that do not want to receive information from us by e-mail may opt out at any time by sending an email us. 

**Security of your Personal Information**  
EarMaster is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, when we transmit sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. We do not store credit card numbers as they only exist temporarily in the order system while the payment is approved.
