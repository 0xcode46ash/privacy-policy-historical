# Privacy & Security

This statement discloses the privacy practices and policies for Eartheasy.com’s website. If you have any questions about these practices and policies, please email us at info@eartheasy.com

Eartheasy respects your personal privacy. We believe ensuring the security of your personal information is an important part of our job, and we strive to protect any personal information you may provide us. If we ask you to provide any personal information, we will tell you the purposes for which we intend to use that information. Your personal information is not lent or sold to anyone for any purpose.

## Information Collection, Use, and Disclosure

Information gathered on Eartheasy.com falls under the following categories:

  * Aggregate Site Use Information
  * Online Order Information and Security



## Aggregate Site Use Information

In order to improve our site, we record information about the pages viewed by all of our website visitors. This data includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, connection speed, read time, display time, and number of clicks.

We use this data, in aggregate form, to compile statistics and reports for Eartheasy’s use, and improve the online experience for all visitors.

We may, on occasion, provide portions of this aggregate information to vendors, consultants, potential advertisers, or news agencies. Typical uses of the data in this fashion would be to gauge the amount of interest in our site and/or to plan for site infrastructure improvements.

None of your personally identifiable information is used.

**Cookie Use**  
Almost every website on the internet uses cookies. A cookie is a small text file stored on a user's hard drive. Depending on how you have configured your browser, when you visit our site we use cookies. Cookies are not required to shop on our site. We use cookies to assist with anonymous site traffic analysis, which includes tracking the time/date of visits, pages viewed, and referring URLs.

There are simple ways to either refuse all cookies, or accept them each time they are offered. Consult your browser's help files for assistance on changing cookie settings or removing cookie files.

## Online Order Information and Security

If you place an order online, we only request the information needed to complete the processing of your orders and billing. We also share our users' personal information with outside shipping companies and credit card processing companies in order to bill and ship your order, but we do not provide any more information than necessary for these purposes. We may also use the information to contact you regarding your order.

**Our Site Security**  
We use appropriate security safeguards to protect your personal information against loss, theft, and unauthorized access. Any personal information you provide to Eartheasy.com is exchanged on a secure server. We use one of today's most advanced security systems, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, to encrypt, or encode, information you send to us in the order process. The encryption process protects information, such as your credit card number, and billing and shipping information by scrambling it before it is sent from your computer. Only once we receive your information is it decoded, and we make all reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our own systems.

**Warning:**  
E-mail is not a secure means to send personal information, as it is not encrypted. We strongly encourage you to use our secure ordering process when ordering online. Never email us with your credit card number, as email is not a secure enough form of communication.

**Newsletter Subscription**  
Newsletters are sent only to users who choose to provide us with their email address. Our newsletter subscriber database is never sold, rented or loaned to any other parties.

We collect aggregate information regarding open rates, page views, and generated sales from our HTML email newsletters. Aggregate information does not personally identify individuals.

**Opting Out** If you wish to have any of your personal information removed from our database, or if you no longer want us to send any further communications to you, please send an e-mail to info@eartheasy.com.
