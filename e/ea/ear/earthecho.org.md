We only use your email address to send you the email updates, updates about the site, and occasional communications on topics we think you may find of interest. Sometimes we will share a message from another organization, firm, or person, if we think it is of interest to our subscribers. We do not sell, rent, share or distribute your e-mail address in any way. We may, however, share information with third parties in limited circumstances, including when we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of EarthEcho or the public as required or permitted by law. We will give you advance notice of any changes to the provisions of this paragraph, including a reasonable opportunity to opt-out of receiving further communications.
