  * Personalize your shopping experience

Your personal information will be shared with your credit card company and the party through whom your product is shipped. This shared personal information includes all of the following: 

Your personal information is not distributed to Earn.comSM partners or to mailing-list firms. Although we may occasionally share statistics about our customers with important business partners, we do not disclose any identifying information about individual customers. If you elect to participate in a BCS promotion (contest or sweepstakes), we will share your personal information in order to ensure redemption of that promotion with the third-party partner managing that promotion. Our site may also contain links to other sites on the Internet. Earn.comSM is not repsonsible for the privacy practices or the content of any of these linked sites. 

#### Cookies

We may set and access cookies on your computer. Cookies may be used to help better our online customer's experience as well as for providing anonymous information about our promotions.

#### Correcting or Updating Your Personal Information

If the personal information we've gathered from you changes (such as your name, e-mail address, street address, or telephone number) or you no longer desire our service, we will gladly correct, update, or remove any personal data you have previously provided to us.
