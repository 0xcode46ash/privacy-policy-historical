In order to process your order, we will collect some standard information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, its expiration date, and telephone number. For customers paying through alternative methods (such as a bank wire), additional information is required. We collect this information in order to:

Your personal information will be shared with your credit card company and the party through whom your product is shipped. This shared personal information includes all of the following: your name, email address, street address, telephone number and credit card information.

In addition to the information you choose to submit, our systems are set up to gather certain anonymous data to help us better understand how our site is being used and how to improve our site for your convenience. This automatically gathered data includes your computer's IP or "Internet Protocol" address, statistics about how visitors navigate through our site, and information provided through the use of "cookies." 

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. Our cookies are used for two reasons: (1) to help you keep track of your information for your own convenience; (2) to help us understand our audience in aggregate and the traffic patterns within our site so that we can continuously improve our products and services. 

For your convenience, our Web site may contain links to companies offering products or services through our Web site. These other company Web sites are not under the control of Earn.com, and we can make no promises or guarantees regarding data collection or privacy practices on those third party Web sites. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personally identifiable information. We strongly suggest that you review such third parties' privacy policies before providing any data to them. You should contact these entities directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect. 

##### **How We Protect and Use Your Personal Information**

To protect your personal and credit card information from unauthorized access, all information exchanged between our servers and your Web browser is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology and is accessible only by designated staff. All of our employees are made aware of our Confidentiality of Client Information Policy on a regular basis and must acknowledge that they have received and read the same. We also secure the infrastructure that supports information collection, exchange, and storage/retrieval at the following levels. We use firewalls to secure the perimeter of our information network and monitor our systems on a regular basis. We also use an authentication and authorization mechanism based on user i.d. and password to restrict access to your personal information. Each authenticated user only has access to the information that he or she is authorized to use. 

All credit card and personal information is treated as confidential and proprietary and is not shared outside Earn.com, TCC or BCS.
