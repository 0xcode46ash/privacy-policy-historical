# EAB: Privacy Statement

**Privacy Statement**

**Recognition of a Customer's Expectation of Privacy**  
EAB recognizes the importance of safeguarding the personal information of our customers. The following privacy principles reflect our commitment to maintain the confidentiality of personal information and to provide our customers with the best possible service.

**Use, Collection and Retention of Customer Information  
**We collect, retain and use information about individual customers only where we reasonably believe it would be useful (and allowed by law) in conducting our business and to provide products, services and other opportunities to our customers.

**Maintenance of Accurate Information  
**We strive to make sure that the information we maintain about our customers is accurate, current and complete and we respond to requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner.

**Limiting Employee Access to Information  
**We limit employee access to personal information about our customers to those employees who have a business reason to know this information. We also educate our employees to understand the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy in accordance with our Standards of Conduct.

**Protection of Information via Established Security Procedures  
**We maintain security standards and procedures regarding unauthorized access to customer information.

**Sharing Information among EAB-Affiliated Companies  
**To allow us to continue to offer you the best possible products and services to meet your financial needs, Bank affiliates are allowed to share certain information about you and your accounts with each other (such as transaction experience). You may request that information about you gathered from applications, credit reports, or other consumer reports not be shared among affiliates. To do so, please send your name, address (as it appears on your statement), account type(s), account number(s) and Social Security number to EAB (attn: Department #112), P.O. Box 9199, Uniondale NY 11555-9199. Please do not include any other correspondence and allow 8 - 10 weeks for your request to be processed.

**Sharing Information with Third Parties  
**During the course of normal bank business, sometimes it is necessary to provide unaffiliated third parties with information about you or your accounts. Under all circumstances, third parties will be required to maintain the confidentiality of the information provided to them. The following outlines instances when account information may be shared:

Sometimes information is shared with parties that have been hired to perform services for the Bank (such as statement creation). These entities will be required to maintain the confidentiality of the information provided. Aside from rare circumstances (when a government agency may require information), service providers will be required to use information only for its intended use.

Following standard business practices, information is exchanged with reputable information reporting agencies, financial institutions and other merchants so we can verify the existence and state of customer accounts.

Several government laws and regulations require us to provide certain customer information to government agencies or other parties. We only provide government agencies or other parties information when required by law.

If you are involved in litigation, federal and state regulations require us, and other third parties, to provide records and other information. This information will only be provided when we are compelled by active litigation.

In the ordinary course of our business, your loan account(s) may be sold. We reserve the right to share customer information with potential purchasers when such a sale is contemplated, and to transfer ownership of such information along with the account(s) if a sale occurs.

From time to time, financial services that you may find valuable might be offered via a third party. If you wish to be taken off marketing lists provided to these third parties, please send your name, address (as it appears on your statement), account type(s), account number(s) and Social Security number to EAB (attn: Unit B-7), P.O. Box 9199, Uniondale NY 11555-9199. Please do not include any other correspondence and allow 8 - 10 weeks for your request to be processed. Please note, third parties receive information from many sources besides EAB and its affiliates. This request only covers instances where EAB or one of its affiliates provides information to an unaffiliated third-party marketer; your request will not impact your eligibility to receive information sent to you by us, or our affiliates.

**Removal from EAB Solicitations  
**You may want to discontinue receiving mail solicitations or telephone solicitations from EAB or its affiliates. While this may mean that you will not receive product or service information of interest to you, we will respect anyone's wishes to not be informed directly of these promotions or product introductions by sending your name, address (as it appears on your statement), account type(s), account number(s) and Social Security number to EAB (attn: Dept. 476), P.O. Box 9199, Uniondale, NY 11555-9199. Please specify that you want to be removed from mail, telephone solicitation or both and allow 8 - 10 weeks for your request to be processed.

**Removal from Other Lists  
**A variety of other marketing companies, including financial institutions, may acquire your name from many sources besides EAB or its affiliates. If you wish to have your name removed from lists created by the companies and agencies that compile lists, send a written request with your name, address and Social Security number (if issued) to the addresses listed below. The Direct Marketing Association will add your name to its customer exclusion files so that your name will be removed from lists compiled or maintained by the agencies that are members of the that organization.
