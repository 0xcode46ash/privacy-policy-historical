# Avocent - Privacy Statement

**Avocent Respects Your Privacy**  
Avocent Corporation and its affiliates respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Statement is designed to inform you of our privacy policies and practices and of the choices you can make about the way information is collected from you online and how that information is used. In general, you can visit our website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. As detailed below, however, there are times when we may need information from you.

 **Collection of Personal Information**

The personal information we may request includes your name, title, company or organization name, email address, phone number, address, billing or credit card information, and other similar personal information. We may also collect other information about your visit to this website including data on the pages you visit, unique URLs (Uniform Resource Locators that specify a unique global address of documents or other resources on the internet) visited on the website, browser type, and IP address. Most of this data is collected via cookies or other analysis technologies. Avocent use cookies, Web beacons, and other technologies for data analysis and personalization services. Avocent also places ads on other websites that may use cookies. Avocent collects and analyzes this information to evaluate how visitors use the website.

Personal data we collect online from you may also be combined with information you provide Avocent through other sources such as product registration, call centers, or public events such as trade shows or seminars. Personal data given to Avocent may be transferred across state and country borders for the purposes of data consolidation, storage, and simplified customer information management.

 **Use of Personal Information**

Avocent uses your personal information to provide you with services and to help us better understand your needs and interests. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction or order, to communicate with you, to provide service and support, to update you on services and benefits, to personalize promotional offers, and to improve this website. Occasionally we may also use your information to contact you for market research regarding Avocent products or services.

In addition, Avocent may disclose personal information in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention, regulation, or other legal action if Avocent reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to protect Avocent, its employees or  
customers, or the public.

 **Sharing of Personal Information**

Avocent shares customer information with Avocent-owned subsidiaries and with other business entities and companies working on our behalf for the purposes of performing services for Avocent and responding to your requests for products or services. Suppliers and service providers are required to keep confidential the information received on behalf of Avocent and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Avocent. These service providers may change or we may contract with additional service providers to better accommodate our customers. Avocent will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others without your permission.

 **Security and Accuracy Personal Information**

Avocent strives to keep your personal information secure and accurate. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, Avocent has implemented a variety of security technologies and management processes and policies to maintain customer data security and accuracy. For example, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data, and we store personal information on servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. We will provide you with access to your information, including the opportunity to change your information. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as a password and user ID, before granting access to your data.

 **Children's Privacy**

Avocent is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. Avocent does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13, and Avocent does not target its website to children under 13.

 **Links to Other Websites**

This Avocent website provides links to third-party websites for your convenience and information. If you access those links, you will leave this Avocent website. Avocent does not control those websites or their privacy practices, which may differ from Avocent's. We do not endorse or make any representations about any third-party websites. The personal data you choose to give to unrelated third parties is not covered by this Avocent Privacy Statement. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information. Some third-party companies may choose to share their personal data with Avocent, and that sharing is governed by that third-party company's privacy policy.

 **Cookies and Other Web technologies**

 **Your Choices and Opting Out**  
Avocent gives you the choice of receiving a variety of information that complements our products and services. You can subscribe to receive certain product- and service-specific information and Avocent marketing communications. Avocent communications may include new product information, special offers, or an invitation to participate in market research.
