An Introduction to Equifax’s Privacy Policies and Online Security Procedures

* * *

> For more than 100 years, Equifax has been a catalyst for commerce by bringing businesses and consumers together. We have built our good reputation through a commitment to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive information. Because safeguarding information privacy, online and off, is a top priority for you and Equifax …

… we take reasonable steps to:

  * Give web visitors clear notice of the information requested of them and of the purpose for which that information will be used;


  * Maintain accurate records, provide access to that information and, when that information has changed or may be inaccurate, provide a fair correction procedure; and


  * Implement safe and secure systems, physical and electronic, to safeguard personally identifiable information.

Equifax and BBBOnLine

Equifax is a proud member of the Council of Better Business Bureaus’ BBB _OnLine_ Ž Privacy Program steering committee, and our web site at www.Equifax.com conforms to all program policies. As such, we commit to abide by our posted privacy policies and submit to a comprehensive and independent verification of these policies by BBB _OnLine_. Information that is submitted solely for business purposes is not covered by program guidelines. Only domestic sites intended for use by U.S. residents are eligible for the BBB _OnLine_ Privacy Program seal. Therefore, our international sites, links to which are provided on our home page, fall outside the scope of the BBB _OnLine_ program, including [_http://www.equifax.co.uk/_](http://www.equifax.co.uk/) (Equifax UK); [_http://www.equifax.ca/_](http://www.equifax.ca/) (Equifax Canada); [_http://www.dicom.cl/_](http://www.dicom.cl/) (Equifax DICOM); [_http://www.veraz.com.ar/_](http://www.veraz.com.ar/) (Equifax Organizacion Veraz); [_http://www.sci.com.br/_](http://www.sci.com.br/) (Equifax Brazil-SCI); [_http://www.equifax.com.sv/_](http://www.equifax.com.sv/) (Equifax DICOM-El Salvador); [_http://www.infocorp.com.pe/_](http://www.infocorp.com.pe/) (Equifax Peru-Infocorp); [_http://www.asnefequifax.es/_](http://www.asnefequifax.es/) (Equifax Spain-ASNEF).

Equifax and the Online Privacy Alliance

In addition to our adherence to BBB _OnLine_ policies, Equifax is also a member of the Online Privacy Alliance (OPA). Equifax and OPA support self-regulatory initiatives that create an environment of trust and that foster the protection of individuals’ privacy online and in electronic commerce.

Notice, Choice, Access, Accuracy and Redress

Personally identifiable information that Equifax maintains about you in its credit database is regulated by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, which provides for a procedure to review, update and correct information contained in your file. To order a copy of your credit report and review your file [_click here_](https://www.econsumer.equifax.com/). When you receive your file, you will be given a special, toll-free telephone number to initiate updates or corrections to your file.

When you order your credit information online from Equifax, we capture certain data to process that request and to verify your identity to ensure that we are sending the correct report to the proper individual. This is for your protection and to help eliminate ID fraud and fraudulent orders. You also have the option of ordering your credit report by mail or telephone. The decision to order your credit report online (or by mail or telephone) is completely voluntary.

Specifically, the information we collect online for verification and processing includes:

  * First and last name (middle initial and suffix, as applicable);
  * Social Security number;
  * Date of birth;
  * Gender;
  * Home telephone number;
  * E-mail address;
  * Current and former mailing address;
  * Credit card number and expiration date; and
  * Drivers license number, state of issue, and address on license



Additionally, we ask you from two to six multiple choice questions about information contained in your credit file, questions to which only you are likely to know the answer.

Equifax uses "cookie" technology only during those web sessions where you access the Consumer Center, register for a User ID and Password, and chose to order additional products during that same session. All other visits to our web site will be anonymous.

Equifax does not disclose (sell, rent or provide) the personally identifiable data you provide online to any third party for any marketing purposes, except for some of our Consumer Services products. Please see the privacy policy governing our Consumer Services suite of products at [www.econsumer.equifax.com](http://www.econsumer.equifax.com/) for details. Equifax may also use the data including postal address and/or email address to send promotions for Equifax products and services.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act prescribes a system for you to "opt-out" of certain uses of information in your credit report. This opt-out feature allows you to indicate that you do not want to receive any promotional materials from Equifax either by email or the US Postal Service. If you prefer not to receive pre-approved offers, you may call

1-888-5 OPT OUT (1-888-567-8688).

To opt-out by regular U.S. mail, write to us, include your full name, Social Security number, date of birth, and mailing address, at:

> > Equifax Options  
>  P.O. Box 740123  
>  Atlanta, Georgia 30374-0123

Your Online Security

Equifax recognizes the importance of secure online transactions, and we safeguard the privacy of information provided to us through online forms. For consumer requests submitted to us online, we use programs that encrypt the data you provide on the order form before transmission to Equifax. The data is decrypted only upon receipt by Equifax.
