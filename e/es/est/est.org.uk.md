# Privacy | Energy Saving Trust

The General Data Protection Regulation will change the rights you have with regards to the personal data we hold and use about you. Your new rights are described in the guidance below. If you have any questions or concerns about how we use your personal information please contact our Data Protection Officer*. You can also find useful information on the [Information Commissioner’s Office’s website](http://ico.org.uk/).

*Data Protection Officer details for Energy Saving Trust:

**Write to:**  Energy Saving Trust England, 30 North Colonnade, Canary Wharf, London, E14 5GP. 

**Email:**  [DataProtectionOfficer@est.org.uk](mailto:DataProtectionOfficer@est.org.uk)

**If you feel that we have not responded appropriately to any requests to use your rights you have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (as detailed above).**

For any request relating to your information we will ask for proof of identity to make sure we are talking to the right person, and to avoid disclosing information that belongs to another person. This may be done through asking questions (such as your address, telephone number, email address and reference number, should you have one) or sometimes we might ask for other evidence.

If you are asking about information relating to another person, a relative for example, we need to be sure you have the authority to act on that person’s behalf. Normally this can be done through evidence of a ‘Power of Attorney’ or similar document.

**Accessing information we hold about you**

If you think we hold information about you, you can ask us about that information. You do not have to make this request in writing, however we will always ask questions to make sure we know who you are or we might ask for further proof of identity. This additional proof may take the form of recent utility bills or we may request to see photographic identification such as a current driving licence.

We will let you know if we are using your information and let you have access to it. We may ask you to let us know exactly what information you are looking for if we hold a large amount of information about you.

We will give you the following information:

What we are using your information for (including the details of any credit check carried out if you applied for loan funding through us), What sort of information about you that we hold, Who we have shared your information with, If we didn’t get your information from you, we will tell you where we got it from, How long we are likely to keep your information.

**Right to object to direct marketing**

See section regarding direct marketing.

**Research**

You may have agreed to be part of some research that we are carrying out – for example, into changing behaviour. If you change your mind about being part of any research, please let us know and we will stop using your personal information and remove your details from the research.

**Automated Decisions**

You have rights relating to any automated decisions that we may take about you.

We use a credit checking service when you apply to receive loan funding us. The service provider does not give a ‘pass’ or ‘fail’ answer when we use their services. Instead we are given a ‘score’ based on your information held by them. We have used our knowledge to decide what ‘score’ is needed for people to be eligible for the loan.

If you do not meet the requirements, we will give you an opportunity to appeal this decision, by giving us some additional information. It may be that the information held by the credit checking service is incorrect – you can contact them to find out what they hold and make any corrections if needed

We will always carry out a credit check if you apply for a loan and this forms part of the conditions of the funding.

**Profiling**

We may use your information to map the way people use energy in their homes, to get an understanding of how energy efficiency measures can change the amount of energy used in homes or to get a better picture of the housing stock of the UK.

When we use your information in this way, we will always make sure your information is kept secure. We will use modelling techniques and data minimisation to make sure that you are not able to be identified from any reports produced.

Additionally, only certain types of organisations will be able to access this information. When we do so we will make sure there is a contract in place restricting the use of the information.  We will only release information at level that will ensure no individual can be identified. Organisations will only be able to use the information for specific reasons related to improving the efficiency of buildings and reducing the impact of climate change. 

  * if we still have a valid reason for using your personal information, or
  * in connection to any legal action.



If we have agreed to restrict the use of your personal information, we will only use it with your agreement, to defend any legal action, to protect the rights of another person or in the public interest.

We will let you know if we intend to remove any restriction on using your personal information, for example when we have found your personal information to be correct.

If we have shared your information with other organisations, we will let them know about any corrections, deletion or restriction of use of your personal data.

**Data Portability**

You have the right to obtain the data you have given us through the Home Energy Check. This is because you provided the information through our online tool which automatically provides you with information about your property and ways you can improve the energy efficiency of your home.

If you would like us to do this for you, we will do this free of charge and in a way that should be able to be understood by the other organisation’s computer systems. They will be able to use this information to provide you with their services. In some cases we may be able to transfer this information directly to the other organisation – but this will depend on their systems being able to work with ours and allowing the transfer of information.

We will in most cases be able to provide you with your information within a month, but we may need longer than this if your request is complicated or if you have asked for many (up to two months).  We will let you know if we need longer to give you your information and we will explain why we can’t give you the information more quickly.

Please contact us if you wish to take advantage of this service and we will be happy to help you.

**Right to Object**

You can object to our use of your personal information. This is because we will have either obtained you permission to use your personal information, or we will have provided you with a condition known as a ‘legitimate interest’. A ‘legitimate interest would be where, for example, you had asked us to send you a loan application form. In order to complete this request we need to know and be able to use some of your personal information.  

We will always let you know you have this right when we first take your information. 

In some cases we will be unable to carry out your instruction to stop using your information. This will be:

when we are carrying out a legally required task (for example information relating to the Energy Performance Certificate Register),

We will provide you with information about the action we have taken in one month of receiving your request to delete your information and having received any proof of identity asked for. In some cases we may require additional time to provide you with a response. We will only do this if the request is complicated or there are more than one request submitted. We will always keep in touch and let you know the status of your request.

**Restricting the use of your personal information**

You have the right to restrict our use of your personal information where:

The accuracy of your personal information is in dispute and until we have been able to check your personal data to ensure that it is right The use of your personal data is unlawful and you want to prevent us from deleting it We no longer need your personal data for the reason it was collected but you want the information kept to take or defend legal action You have objected to our use of your personal information for direct marketing (in this case we would no longer send you direct marketing but would keep your information on a ‘list’ of people not to be contacted by us)

In some cases we may have received permission to use your image in our marketing material, on our website and/or through our social media sites when you were a child (either from you or your parents/guardian). Please let us know if you would like to withdraw this permission and we will remove your images as requested. We will additionally contact the providers of our advice service to make sure your image is no longer used by them. 

**Refusing your request**

We may refuse a request to delete your information if the use of your information is:

for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information (e.g.  for the purposes of journalism), to comply with legislation, or carrying out a task in the public interest, or in an official capacity (e.g. the retention of Environmental Performance Certificates as the ‘Keeper of the Register), used for statistical purposes (normally concerned with the state of the housing stock) used in relation to a legal claim.

We will provide you a copy of your personal information in one month of receiving your request for your personal information and having received any proof of identity asked for. In some cases we may require additional time to provide you with all your information. We will only do this if the request is complicated or there are more than one request submitted. We will always keep in touch to let you know when you will receive the copy of your information, if there will be a delay in providing your information and the reason for any delay.

If you request your information via email (or by any other electronic way) we will normally provide the copy of your personal information electronically where we can. However, we will discuss with you how you would prefer to receive the copy of your information and explain any reasons if we cannot provide your information in the way you would prefer.

**Charges and refusing requests for personal information**

We will normally not request payment to give you a copy of your personal information. However, we may make a charge if you have already recently requested the same information. In some very rare cases where numerous requests for the same information have been made we may refuse to provide the information again. Where we can, we will always clearly explain any decision to refuse to provide you with your personal information.

If the information you have requested includes the personal information of another individual we will (depending upon the circumstances) remove information that identifies that person.

**Correcting information**

If we hold information about you that is wrong you have the right to have this corrected. If we agree that the information is incorrect we will always correct this information quickly or complete information where appropriate. If we do not agree that the information is wrong we will record that you have raised a request to have the information altered and that it is in dispute.
