**Security precautions in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information.**

Our secure server software (SSL) technology secures your information with state-of-the-art public key encryption. The SSL technology encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. You can verify that online forms are secure by checking the Web page URL displayed at the top of your browser screen. Secure documents begin with the protocol https://, while unsecured forms and Web pages begin with the usual http:// (HyperText Transfer Protocol). You can also look for the graphical icon specific to your browser type, located in the bottom right hand corner of your browser window. 

In addition, all customer data we collect is stored on secure servers and protected against unauthorized access. We operate a secure data network protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Your Essential.com Account Information is password-protected so that only you have access to this personal information. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Essential.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your Essential.com account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. 

Whenever Essential.com handles personal information as described above, regardless of where this occurs, Essential.com takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Essential.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
