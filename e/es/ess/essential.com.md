# Essential - The Power to Provide it All

**Essential.com** is committed to protecting your online privacy. As part of the normal operation of our services we collect and may, in some cases, disclose information about you. For example we must share certain information with our service partners and vendors in order to provide you with the energy and communications services you wish to receive, and to bill you and accept payment for those services. By signing up for our services, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information. Please read the following Privacy Policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our services. Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time; we will post those changes on this page so please check back periodically. 

**What personally identifiable information is collected from you.**

To use Essential.com, you register using our online registration form, where you will be required to provide us with your contact information and other personal information, including your name, telephone number, as well as email and postal addresses. You will also be asked to provide credit card information (including type of credit card, credit card number, expiration date, and billing address). This information is necessary in order for us to provide you the Essential.com services and to bill you and accept payment for those services. Also, when you provide information to us on our site feedback form, we use such information for enhancing our customer care and for tracking our performance. 

**What "cookies" are and how they are used.**

A "cookie" is a small data file that a web site transfers to a user's hard drive when the user visits the web site. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages visited. The only personal information a cookie can contain is what the user supplies. A cookie can't read data off a hard drive or read cookie files created by other sites. 

Many Internet services deliver cookies to visitors to their web sites. Cookies store information about your use of their service on your computer where it can only be retrieved by the same service at a later time. Cookies are used by Internet services to make their services more convenient and personalized. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but by modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. You can also delete cookies from your hard drive. Even without a cookie, you can still use all of the features of Essential.com. 

Generally, Essential.com uses cookies to: 

  1. remind us of who you are, to access your account information, and to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session; and 
  2. measure your visiting patterns and allow us to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you will see on our sites, in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. 



**How your information is used.**

The information collected from you at registration is necessary to provide you with Essential.com's services and to bill you and accept payment for those services. 

You will receive an email notice of online bill statement availability on a monthly basis. We also send periodic updates about Essential.com (including administrative notices, new product and service offerings, and communications relevant to your use of Essential.com) to our customers. We provide you with the ability to unsubscribe from promotional, newsletter or survey emails. 

Occasionally our Customer Care Representatives survey selected shoppers by telephone to learn about their experience at the Essential.com site. If you prefer not to be contacted for this purpose, please contact our [Customer Care](https://web.archive.org/help) team. 

We may also use personally identifiable information about you on an aggregated basis (including limited aggregate information collected through log files) to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings, to customize our site's content, layout, services, and to advise service providers about service offerings. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our users' needs. 

**Who is collecting your information.**

Your information is being collected solely by Essential.com. See the discussion under "With whom your information may be shared" below concerning the circumstances under which certain of your information may be disclosed to third parties. 

**With whom your information may be shared.**

We will share your contact information only with the service providers you've selected. These providers will call you to set up appointments and gather additional information as necessary. 

Essential.com does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to advertisers and for other marketing and promotional purposes or to reputable third-party service suppliers. In these situations, we would not disclose any information that could be used to personally identify you. 

Essential.com may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of Essential.com, our users, or others. 

In addition Essential may decide to stop providing a service or may decide to sell or transfer parts or even all of our business to unaffiliated companies. If this happens we may provide confidential customer information to these companies so that they can provide you with the same or similar services. In such circumstances Essential will provide information to these other companies only as needed to accomplish our business objectives, and we will make our best efforts to see that the companies provide you the same level of privacy protection as Essential provides you now. 

**Choices available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information.**

The information collected from you at registration is necessary to provide you with Essential.com's services. Your only alternative to providing this information is to not use Essential.com. 

If you'd like to be removed from the mailing list for periodic updates about Essential.com or from participation in surveys conducted by Customer Care Representatives, we provide the ability to unsubscribe from this type of email communication. 

**Accessing, updating or deleting your information.**

You may update or change information related to your Essential.com account by accessing the Your Account section of the website with your username and password. If you wish to review the information we have retained about you at any time or if you believe that any of the information we have retained is incorrect, please contact our [Customer Care](https://web.archive.org/help) team with the correct information. 

We will retain in our files information you have requested to remove in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce the terms of your User Registration. Further, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. 

**Security precautions in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information.**

Our secure server software (SSL) technology secures your information with state-of-the-art public key encryption. The SSL technology encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. You can verify that online forms are secure by checking the Web page URL displayed at the top of your browser screen. Secure documents begin with the protocol https://, while unsecured forms and Web pages begin with the usual http:// (HyperText Transfer Protocol). You can also look for the graphical icon specific to your browser type, located in the bottom right hand corner of your browser window. 

In addition, all customer data we collect is stored on secure servers and protected against unauthorized access. We operate a secure data network protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Your Essential.com Account Information is password-protected so that only you have access to this personal information. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Essential.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your Essential.com account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. 

Whenever Essential.com handles personal information as described above, regardless of where this occurs, Essential.com takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Essential.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 

Please contact us if you have any questions about our privacy policy or security at the Essential.com site. You can contact our [Customer Care](https://web.archive.org/help) team or call our Customer Care Center at (888) 746-4983.
