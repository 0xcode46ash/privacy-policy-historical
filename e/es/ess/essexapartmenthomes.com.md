This is the privacy policy of Essex Property Trust, Inc., its subsidiaries and related entities (“Essex,” “we,” “our” or “us”).  Essex is committed to protecting your privacy.  This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices with regard to information about you that could reasonably be used to identify you personally or that is associated with information that identifies you (“Personal Information”).

This web site (the “Web Site”) is provided by Essex.  Unless specifically stated otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies only to Personal Information that we gather or collect via the Web Site and any other Essex web site that posts a link to this Privacy Policy.  It does not apply to any Personal Information collected offline or otherwise outside of the Web Site.  Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, Essex will never share, sell, or rent individual Personal Information with anyone without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law.

  


## What Information Does Essex Gather About Me?

 **Information You Provide**

We collect from you certain Personal Information you voluntarily provide in order to deliver the best possible service.  For example, you may be asked to provide Personal Information  when you fill out and submit forms (such as forms requesting information needed to consider you for apartment rentals or potential employment opportunities), when you initiate payments to us through the Web Site, when you participate in promotions, contests, or sweepstakes on the Web Site, when you post to any interactive forum, bulletin board, chat room that we may make available on the Web Site, when you register for email communications, and when you submit a survey response, question or request to the Web Site using a form or the email address links on the Web Site.  If you choose to schedule a tour, request more information or seek potential employment, we may ask you to provide us with information necessary to contact you or mail you information including without limitation your name, physical address, telephone number and email address.  We may collect your email address so that we can send you information you have requested. We may use your email address to inform you about current events or to send you updates regarding information that was previously sent to you.

  


## Web Server Logs

When you visit our Web Site, we may track information to administer the Web Site and analyze its usage.

Examples of information we may track include:

  * Your Internet protocol address.
  * The kind of browser or computer you use.
  * Number of links you click within the site.
  * State or country from which you accessed the site.

## Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a users’ computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this Web Site. We may link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on our Web Site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Web Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s help file.

We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Web Site and other Web sites.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our Web Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Web Site, such as saving properties, will be limited.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use cookies on our Web Site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this Web Site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any business partners or advertisers on our Web Site or other Essex web sites.  See the “Third Party Advertisers” and “Links to Other Sites” sections of this Privacy Policy below for more information.

We use Google Analytics and Google AdWords on the Web Site to collect non-personally identifiable data, such as the data listed at the beginning on this section above, to analyze how users use the Web Site, and to provide targeted advertisements to you on our Web Site and other Web sites.  For more information about how to opt out of having your information used by Google Analytics and Google AdWords, visit <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/> and <http://www.google.com/settings/ads>.

  


## Clear Gifs (Web Beacons)

We may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help us better manage content on our Web Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ Personal Information. We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

  


## Third Party Advertisers

The ads appearing on this Web Site or other Essex web sites, if any, may be delivered to users by third-party advertising companies. Third-party advertising companies may use cookies and clear gifs on this Web Site, which allow it to recognize a user’s cookie when a user visits this Web Site and other Web sites. The companies serve their ads from their own web sites, independently from Essex. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, web browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to the Web Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you. The information that the third-party advertising companies collect and share through this technology is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that you visit that collects personally identifiable information.

Our systems do not recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals, but several of our business partners who utilize cookies, Web Beacons, or other tracking technologies on the Web Site enable you to opt out of certain of their cookies, Web Beacons, and other tracking technologies and the tailoring of advertisements to your interests.  To learn more about cookies, Web Beacons, and other tracking technologies or to opt-out of advertising using these technologies, you can visit [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) or [www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).  We also provide you with additional tools to opt out of certain communications from us.  You can learn about this in the “Your Choices” section of this Privacy Policy.

  


## Facebook Connect or other OpenID provider

We may offer you the ability to log in to our Web Site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web Site to your profile page to share with others within your network. Any posting outside of the Web Site is governed by the privacy policies of the posting service and we encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every posting service that collects personally identifiable information.

  


## Links to Other Sites

This privacy statement applies only to Personal Information collected by this Web Site.  This Web Site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Essex. Please be aware that Essex is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

  


## Framing

This Web Site may utilize framing techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the Web Site when the user is actually on a third party Web site.  For example, if you are on a page that has the look and feel of [www.essexapartmenthomes.com,](http://www.essexapartmenthomes.com%2C/) but the URL listed in your browser is a different URL than [www.](http://www/) essexapartmenthomes.com, then know that any information you provide is being collected by this third party and not governed by this Privacy Policy.  We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

  


## Share This

When you use “Share This” to bookmark and share our products and Web Site, you will be taken to a third party site.  Please note that these third party sites’ privacy policies govern the collection and use of the information collected on those sites.

  


## Child Protection and Privacy

Essex does not knowingly seek to collect via the Web Site or maintain any Personal Information or other information from children under the age of 13.  We will delete any Personal Information or other information later determined to be provided by a child under the age of 13.  Use of the Web Site by children under the age of 13 is not permitted.  By using the Web Site to provide Personal Information to Essex, you represent that you are not under the age of 13.
