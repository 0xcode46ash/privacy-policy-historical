The Web Site Privacy Policy of Essence Communications Partners (ECP) has been developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the finest quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our customers. The Policy guides how we collect, store, and use information about customers and prospects, and it will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers’ changing needs. 

Our Policy recognizes two kinds of personal data that deserve different levels of protection: _Personally-identifiable Information_ includes, for example, e-mail addresses, billing information, employment status and “click stream” data that tracks visitor activity on a Web site or online service. A subset of that category, Sensitive Data, deserves additional safeguards. _Sensitive Data_ includes, by way of example, Social Security n umbers, mother’s maiden names, personal financial data, information about specific medical conditions and most information about children. Our business units collect _Personally-identifiable Information_ and _Sensitive Data_ only when there is a legitimate business reason to do so. Our Policy provides the following: 

**The Information We Collect**  
Our Website does not automatically collect any individually identifiable information from visitors. We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail and any information volunteered by the customer, such as survey information and/or site registrations. This information is used by our editors to better understand our subscribers and by our advertisers to target their advertisements. It is not required for magazine fulfillment and should be submitted at the subscriber’s discretion. 

We need to collect and store your name, address, and other basic _Personally-identifiable Information_ , for example, to fulfill your subscription or to provide other products or service you requested, as well as for billing purposes. This information also enables us to develop and customize products to better meet your needs and preferences and to offer you products from ECP and other sources that may be of interest to you. 

From time to time, we are approached by companies and organizations that have a product or service that we believe may be of interest to you. We may share your Personally-indentifiable information with these companies in an effort to help you find these resources. We do not expect to receive any consideration from those companies or organizations for providing this information; however, we reserve the right to do so. 

If your relationship with us includes providing us with _Sensitive Data_ , we will protect that information with extra care. We will not distribute _Sensitive Data_ outside of ECP. 

At Essence.com you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services, such as our online newsletters. The types of _Personally-identifiable Information_ that may be collected include: name address, e-mail address, telephone number and credit card information. You can submit information about other people. For example, you might want to order a gift subscription and want it sent directly to the recipient. The types of _Personally-identifiable Information_ that may be collected include: recipient’s name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. 

We may also collect certain _non-Personally identifiable Information_ when you visit many of our Web pages, such as the type of browser you are using (i.e. Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (i.e. Windows XP or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (i.e. America Online, Earthlink). 

**How We Use This Information**  
We may use this information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about your offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or service that we believe may be of interest to you. 

We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us. 

We may use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or electronic greeting cards, or to offer our products, programs, or services to them. 

The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services. 

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that _Personally-identifiable Information_ that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to such information. 

**Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors**  
Our site may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. 

Essence.com sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties. By virtue of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain _Personally-identifiable Information_ that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. ECP has no control over the third-party sponsors' use of this information. Essence.com will notify you at the time of requesting _Personally-identifiable Information_ if third-party sponsors will obtain such information. 

ECP may use reputable third parties to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at its Web pages and to conduct research about the advertisements. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that such third parties may have collected from you or the methods used by the third-parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies, Web beacons and clear gifs). 

**Cookies**  
To enhance your experience with our site, many of our Web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other _Personally-identifiable Information_ unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. 

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services. 

We may also use small pieces of code called "Web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These "Web beacons" may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy.
