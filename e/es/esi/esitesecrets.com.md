## eSiteSecrets.com - Privacy Policy

  
**eSiteSecrets.com** collect personal information from users on a voluntary basis only. This information allows us to provide users with the products and services and allow access to secure and subscription areas of our site. 

**_We do not sell or distribute our users' personal or business information to anyone for any reason._**

The display of all information when in the forum, press releases, or classifieds ads may be suppressed. All users should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal or business contact information, that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited emails, postal mail, or phone calls from third parties, for which **eSiteSecrets.com** is not responsible.

**CREDIT CARD SECURITY**  
**eSiteSecrets.com** employs the highest level of encryption for secure credit card transactions. Credit card and contact information is not stored in a publically accessable system that could be compromised, and are destroyed upon successful completion and fulfillment of the transaction. With this kind of security policy, it is safer to use your credit card online with **eSiteSecrets.com** than it is to use it for mail order or telephone order transactions. If you have concerns, you should review your credit card agreement or call the company that issues your card to ask about policies regarding liability for fraudulent Internet charges.

**COOKIES**  
In addition to the personally identifiable information that **eSiteSecrets.com** actively collects when you register for products and services, we also collect anonymous information passively using cookies and Web beacons. This technology plays an important role in making the Internet work, but there is much confusion among Internet users about what cookies and Web beacons are and how they are used. 

A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a Web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the site administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the Web site. This unique number identifies your Web browser to our computer system whenever you visit one of the sites in the **eSiteSecrets.com Network**. A cookie will not allow a Web site to learn any personally identifiable information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise disclosed. 

Cookies allow **eSiteSecrets.com** to automatically remember your Web browser when you visit our Network of Web sites. To help serve you better, **eSiteSecrets.com** generally uses cookies to allow us to deliver products and services more efficiently and measure statistics.
