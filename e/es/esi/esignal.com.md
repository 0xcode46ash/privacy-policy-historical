Cookies: A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes unique, but anonymous, code, which is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience and to make it easier for you to use the Websites upon a future visit. eSignal will also use cookies to recognize you when you return to our Websites. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, though you can manually disable the cookies feature of your browser. You should review the online documentation of your browser or consult with the provider of your browser for instructions on how to disable cookies. Please note that if you disable cookies on your computer, some parts of the Websites may not function properly.

This information is collected and used by eSignal to understand the websites referring traffic to our Websites and to present appropriate content to our potential customers. eSignal tabulates referrer information on an aggregate basis to identify trends and traffic patterns.
> 
> 3.7. Partners: eSignal may enter into agreements with other companies that market software or services that either function similarly to eSignal software or that enhance or extend eSignal’s functionality.

We have entered into contractual agreements with these providers governing the provider arrangement. Under the terms of these agreements, we may be required to collect information about your sessions and your use of your eSignal product and share this information, along with your personally identifiable information, with the provider paying for your eSignal service. This information is kept strictly confidential, and is not shared with other third parties, except as provided for in this Privacy Policy.

4.0 What We Do with Information We Collect and Use   
In general, except as provided in this policy, we will not disclose your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties without your express consent or allowing you to decline to permit the disclosure. There are, however, some limited circumstances in which we may need to disclose personally identifiable information about a user without express consent, including, but not limited to, the circumstances set forth below:

> 4.1. eSignal Website Vendors: We may employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, providing customer service, sending print and electronic mail, processing credit card payments, or other functions necessary to our business. In order to allow these companies to perform their obligations, we may need to share your personally identifiable information with them. However, we will provide these companies with only that information necessary to perform their functions on our behalf, and we will not allow them to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
> 
> 4.2. Resellers: eSignal may from time to time enter into agreements with companies that resell eSignal’s products or services, either on eSignal’s behalf, or on their own behalf on a private labeled basis and/or on a co-branded basis. Under the terms of these agreements, we may be required, and therefore we reserve the right, to share your personally identifiable information with such resellers. Once your personally identifiable information is provided to such resellers, it will no longer be covered by this privacy policy. In those instances, your personally identifiable information will be governed by the privacy policy of the resellers to whom it is provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, eSignal will not share your Order Information with any reseller that is not billing you directly for the re-marketed, private labeled and/or co-branded eSignal services to which you subscribe.
> 
> 4.3. eSignal Publishers and Merchants: eSignal reserves the right to provide to publishers and other merchants for whom eSignal sells or distributes products or services any personally identifiable information as is necessary to fulfill any requests you may make for their products or services. In addition, merchants of the products you purchase or to which you subscribe through eSignal may request additional personally identifiable information from you. eSignal will provide the merchants of such products the information you supply in response to those requests and, following such disclosure by eSignal, your personally identifiable information will no longer be covered by this policy. In those instances, your personally identifiable information is governed by the privacy policy of the merchants whose products you have purchased or to which you have subscribed.
> 
> 4.4. Protection of Rights: We may reveal your personally identifiable information to attorneys, private investigator organizations or law enforcement agencies if we believe that you have harmed or interfered with  (or will imminently harm or interfere) other eSignal users or anyone else or violating (either intentionally or unintentionally) our Website Terms and Conditions of Use or infringing any of eSignal’s legal rights, or harming the legal rights, property, or health or safety of any other person.
> 
> 4.5. Required by Law: eSignal will reveal your personally identifiable information, to the extent we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law. If we receive legal process calling for the disclosure of any of your personally identifiable information we will attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied during registration within a reasonable amount of time before we respond to the request, unless such notification is not permitted.
> 
> 4.6. Asset Transfers: eSignal shall be entitled to transfer to a third party information it maintains, including any personally identifiable information, in connection with a transaction or proceeding involving a transfer of some or all of the assets relating to the Websites or a business in connection with which such information is maintained. 

5.0 Changing or Removing Personal Information; Opting Out   
To ensure that you have appropriate control over your personally identifiable information, you can access your account (after supplying your user name and password) in the Self-Maintenance area of our Websites to update and/or correct the information you have previously submitted. 

In addition, we provide you with the ability to decline -- or “opt-out of” -- certain mailings and other materials we may offer. For these materials, you will be able to specify whether you wish to opt-out by following directions provided in the Self-Maintenance area, as further detailed in Section 6.0 (Communications to out Users) of our Privacy Policy, below.

Finally, if you request, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our active databases. Please understand, however, that it may be impossible to remove this information completely, due to backups and records of deletions. If you wish to remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our database, please create an email with the term “Unsubscribe” in the subject line, and send the email to the address listed in Section 12.0 of this Privacy Policy. As an alternative, you may write to us with your request, at the mailing address set forth in Section 12.0. You will be removed from our databases generally within ten business days of our receipt of your request. You may also request to review or amend any personal information that we maintain about you, by sending a written request to the same address, subject to our verification of your identity acceptance of any proposed revision. 

6.0 Communications to our Users

> 6.1. eSignal: eSignal sends emails and/or postal mailings to new subscribers and to provide to existing subscribers information regarding their specific eSignal products. Periodically, eSignal will send news and information to subscribers and other parties who have expressed interest in eSignal and its products. You can opt out of receiving these promotional communications through the Self-Maintenance area of our Websites. For so long as you use eSignal products and services or otherwise maintain a business relationship with eSignal, however, you may not opt out of receiving communications from eSignal relating specifically to those products and services or business relationship.
> 
> 6.2. Third Parties: Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share personally identifiable information with anyone, unless we have informed you of a change to our Privacy Policy and given you the opportunity to then choose to opt out. eSignal can no longer update any of your personally identifiable information once it has been transferred to such third parties and cannot implement or impose your opt out requests upon such third parties. Instead, you must either contact that third party or refer to its privacy policy to update your personally identifiable information or to let the third party know that you no longer want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about its products, services or offerings.

7.0 Security of Personally Identifiable Information   
eSignal maintains controls to protect the financial information you provide us, including credit card details, during the product purchase process. These controls include: (1) the use of SSL encryption to safeguard information when transmitted from your web browser to eSignal; (2) the logical authentication security within the databases that store customers’ credit card numbers; and (3) use of encryption of credit card numbers. 

eSignal employees are required to acknowledge that they understand and will strictly abide by our corporate policies with respect to the confidentiality of personally identifiable information. Moreover, eSignal only gives access to databases containing personally identifiable information to employees on a need-to-know basis. Internal policies require that passwords be changed regularly, pursuant to security protocols. Our security procedures are reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that they remain current.

Accordingly, we have put in place security systems designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information you provide to us. These systems are structured to deter and prevent hackers and others from accessing this information. Due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, however, we cannot provide, and disclaim, assurance that the information you provide us will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access. 

8.0 Children   
Persons under the age of eighteen (18) are not permitted to register for the eSignal service and eSignal does not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personally identifiable information from persons under the age of eighteen (18). If we learn that a child under the age of eighteen (18) has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will attempt to delete this information from our databases, subject to any technical limitations on our ability to do so.

9.0 Notification of Changes   
eSignal reserves the right to change or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, or to terminate this Privacy Policy. We will post notice of the new policy from the Privacy Policy link on the homepage of our Websites. Your use of our Websites following any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the Privacy Policy, as changed. If we make any significant changes regarding disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties, we will attempt to notify you prior to the date the modified policy takes effect.

10.0 Relationship to Website Terms of Conditions  
Our obligations with respect to your use of the Websites are reflected in this Privacy Policy and  our Website Terms and Conditions and any additional terms of services that may be applicable.

11.0 Your Consent
