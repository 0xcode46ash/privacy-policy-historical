> 3.1. Registration: In order to subscribe to eSignal products and services, we require that you complete a registration form. This form may ask for contact information, such as name, address, email address, telephone number, company name, fax number and other basic contact information ("Registration Information").

The eSignal software transfers this information to eSignal's servers, and such information is used strictly and exclusively for internal resource management purposes.
>

Other: eSignal may automatically receive and record information in our server logs from your browser, including your IP address (the Internet address of your PC), your computer's name, the type and version of your web browser, referrer addresses and other generally-accepted log information.

> 
> 4.2. eSignal Publishers and Merchants: eSignal reserves the right to provide to publishers and other merchants for whom eSignal sells or distributes products or services any personally identifiable information as is necessary to fulfill any requests you may make for their products or services. In addition, merchants of the products you purchase or to which you subscribe through eSignal may request additional personally identifiable information from you. eSignal will provide the merchants of such products the information you supply in response to those requests and, following such disclosure by eSignal, your personally identifiable information will no longer be covered by this policy.

5.0 Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out   
To ensure that you have appropriate control over your personally identifiable information, you can access your account (after supplying your user name and password) in the Self-Maintenance area of our Website to update and/or correct the information you have previously submitted.

In addition, we provide you with the ability to decline -- or “opt-out of” -- certain mailings and other materials we may offer. For these materials, you will be able to specify whether you wish to opt-out by following directions provided in the Self-Maintenance area, as further detailed in Section 6.0 (Communications to out Users) of our Privacy Policy, below.   
Finally, if you request, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our databases. Please understand, however, that it may be impossible to remove this information completely, due to backups and records of deletions. If you wish to remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our database, please create an email with the term "Unsubscribe" in the subject line, and send the email to the address listed in Section 12.0. As an alternative, you may write to us with your request, at the mailing address listed below. You will be removed from our databases generally within ten business days of our receipt of your request.

6.0 Communications to our Users

> 6.1. eSignal: eSignal sends emails and/or postal mailings to new subscribers and to provide to existing subscribers information regarding their specific eSignal products. Periodically, eSignal will send news and information to subscribers and other parties who have expressed interest in eSignal and its products. These communications are an information service to users who have indicated a preference to receive promotions relating to eSignal's products, Site and services and to receive special offers relating to third-party products, sites and services. You can opt out of receiving these promotional communications through the Self-Maintenance area of our Website. For so long as you use eSignal products and services or otherwise maintain a business relationship with eSignal, however, you may not opt out of receiving communications from eSignal relating specifically to those products and services or business relationship.
> 
> 6.2. Third Parties: Except as described in this privacy policy, we do not share personally identifiable information with anyone, unless we have informed you of a change to our privacy policy and given you the opportunity to then choose to opt out. Once you have indicated that your information may be shared with third parties or you have responded to an offer by any third party on the Website, eSignal can no longer update any of your personally identifiable information that has been transferred to such third parties or opt you out of such third parties so that you no longer receive their promotional and/or marketing information. Instead, you must either contact that third party or refer to its privacy policy to update your personally identifiable information or to let the third party know that you no longer want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about its products, services or offerings.

7.0 Security of Personally Identifiable Information   
eSignal maintains controls to protect the financial information you provide us, including credit card details, during the product purchase process. These controls include: (1) the use of SSL encryption to safeguard information when transmitted from your web browser to eSignal; (2) the logical authentication security within the databases that store customers' credit card numbers; and (3) use of encryption of credit card numbers.

eSignal employees are required to acknowledge that they understand and will strictly abide by our corporate policies with respect to the confidentiality of personally identifiable information. Moreover, eSignal only gives access to databases containing personally identifiable information to employees on a need-to-know basis. Internal policies require that passwords be changed regularly, pursuant to security protocols. Our security procedures are reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that they remain current.

Accordingly, we have put in place security systems designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information you provide to us. These systems are structured to deter and prevent hackers and others from accessing this information. Due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, however, we cannot provide, and disclaim, assurance that the information you provide us will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access.

8.0 Children   
Persons under the age of eighteen are not permitted to register for the eSignal service and eSignal does not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personally identifiable information from persons under the age of eighteen. If we learn that a child under 18 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete this information from our databases. 

9.0 Notification of Changes   
From time to time, eSignal may change its Privacy Policy. If we make any changes regarding disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties, we will attempt to contact you prior to the date the modified policy takes effect.

Your use of our Site following any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the Privacy Policy, as changed.
