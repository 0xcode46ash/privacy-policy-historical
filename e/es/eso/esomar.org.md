## Services relating to our membership offer 

Most of our services form an integral part of our membership subscription offer, a contractual arrangement between ESOMAR and its members. We collect and process personal data in order to fulfill the contractual obligations that result from this agreement.

Our membership offer enables our members to benefit from facilitated networking (via events, webinars, a public registry, and online discussion platforms…), access to exclusive content produced by ESOMAR and its members, and protection and coverage under our disciplinary process. We therefore collect personal details in order to deliver these subscribed services and to personalise a member’s experience.

In order to finalise a membership subscription, and in accordance with our application procedures, personal details may be shared with other ESOMAR members part of the network for the purposes of verifying your credentials and subsequently for the purposes of delivering the services mentioned above.
