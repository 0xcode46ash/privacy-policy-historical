WelcomeThe Entertainment Software Rating Board ("ESRB") would like to thank you for visiting our Web site. We are pleased to have the opportunity to help make the Internet a secure, private, and reliable place to share information and conduct business. This Privacy Statement explains how we collect and use information from our Web site visitors. All of ESRB's divisions prescribe to essentially the same information collection and use practices, and all of these practices are stated in this privacy statement. If a practice is specific to a particular ESRB division, this statement will describe that practice in detail and refer directly to the appropriate division (the divisions will be referred to as either: "the Rating Board"; "ESRB Privacy Online"; "ESRB interactive"; or "Advertising Review Council"). If a practice is consistent among all of the divisions, this statement will refer to "ESRB" as a whole.
