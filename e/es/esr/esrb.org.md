_April 4, 2003_

Welcome. The Entertainment Software Rating Board ("ESRB") would like to thank you for visiting our website. We are pleased to have the opportunity to help make the Internet a secure, private, and reliable place to share information and conduct business. This privacy policy explains how we collect and use information from our website visitors. All of ESRB's divisions prescribe to essentially the same information collection and use practices, and all of these practices are stated in this privacy policy. If a practice is specific to a particular ESRB division, this policy will describe that practice in detail and refer directly to the appropriate division (the divisions will be referred to as either: "the Rating Board"; "ESRB Privacy Online"; "ESRB interactive"; or "Advertising Review Council"). If a practice is consistent among all of the divisions, this policy will refer to "ESRB" as a whole.

Whenever you visit a website that displays the ESRB Privacy Online certification seal, you can expect to be notified of the following:

  * The websites and information covered by this Privacy Policy;
  * Exactly what information may be collected and how it will be used;
  * The consequences, if any, resulting from your refusal to provide personal information;
  * Whether a company uses cookies, tracks IP addresses, or uses other passive means to collect information;
  * Who, if anyone, is collecting your personal information;
  * With whom, if anyone, is your personal information shared;
  * What is a company's policy regarding links to third party sites;
  * What choices you have with regard to the use of your personal information;
  * How you can access, and if necessary, change the personal information a company collects and maintains;
  * How a company ensures data security, quality, and integrity; and,
  * Where and how to ask questions or file complaints.

  


What does this Privacy Policy apply to?

This privacy policy applies to the following websites operated by ESRB:

  * [www.ESRB.com](http://www.esrb.com/)
  * [www.ESRB.org](http://www.esrb.org/)

  


Please note that this privacy policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through the website(s) listed above, and does not apply to information that may be collected by ESRB offline. In addition, this privacy policy applies only to sites maintained by ESRB and not to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link. ESRB is therefore not responsible for the content or activities provided on such sites.

**European Union**  
ESRB abides by the Safe Harbor principles as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.

What types of information does ESRB collect and how will it be used? 

ESRB only collects information on a voluntary basis. The personal information ESRB collects is used almost exclusively for communications purposes and will usually take the form of: (1) ESRB Privacy Online's company registration form; (2) ESRB Privacy Online's Sentinel Consumer Online-Hotline; (3) a consumer complaint or inquiry directed to the Rating Board; (4) an ESRB survey; (5) ESRB Privacy Online's Privacy Statement Composer; (6) ESRB's newsletter; (7) Retailer Information and Request Form; and/or, (8) other general information contained in an email (e.g., comments). The types of information that may be requested for each activity and the way the information may be used are detailed below.  


  * **ESRB Privacy Online Company Registration**  
Companies that wish to participate in the privacy online program are required to complete ESRB Privacy Online's company registration form. The requested information may include the company name, address, telephone number and the name of a company representative who will oversee the company's privacy policy initiatives. ESRB Privacy Online uses this information to contact the company representative regarding participation and, if eligible, to communicate with such company on an ongoing basis regarding certification and compliance.
  *  **ESRB Privacy Online Sentinel Consumer Online-Hotline**  
If a consumer believes a privacy violation has taken place at a participating company's website, the consumer has the option of reporting the violation to the Sentinel Consumer Online-Hotline. The requested information may include the consumer's name and e-mail address. The submitted email address will be used solely for the purposes of contacting the consumer about the privacy complaint, updating the consumer concerning the status of a complaint, and to help resolve the complaint. We will never release this information to an external third party unless we have specific, prior-permission from the consumer to do so. In an effort to investigate a possible privacy violation and to resolve a complaint, ESRB Privacy Online may disclose a consumer's first name, last name, and e-mail address to the participating company referenced in a complaint. We will never release additional personal information to the participating company referenced in a complaint unless we have specific, prior-permission from the consumer to do so.  

  *  **Consumer Complaints Directed to the Rating Board**  
From time to time, the Rating Board receives complaints or inquiries regarding the ESRB rating system and/or the rating icons/symbols. When a complaint or inquiry is received, the Rating Board promptly investigates the complaint or inquiry, and then, when appropriate, responds to the individual who sent the complaint or inquiry via the e-mail address from where the request originated.
  *  **ESRB Survey**  
Any one of the ESRB divisions may conduct surveys. The surveys are conducted strictly for internal profiling purposes and only keep track of anonymous demographic data (e.g., whether you are a parent, a game player, or a publisher).
  *  **ESRB Privacy Online's Privacy Statement Composer**  
ESRB Privacy Online's Privacy Statement Composer is designed to help you create a first draft of your privacy statement that can subsequently be customized to meet your company's particular business model and privacy practices. The Privacy Statement Composer asks for information such as your company name, company address, company telephone number, and contact information. The collected information is used for the sole purpose of creating a privacy statement.
  *  **ESRB Newsletter**  
Visitors who wish to subscribe to the ESRB newsletter will be asked to provide their e-mail address. The submitted e-mail address is then used to send you, via e-mail, our quarterly newsletter and to otherwise keep you informed as to what's going on at the ESRB.
  *  **Retailer Information and Request Form**  
Retailers who wish to have access to the retailer portion of our website or receive updates regarding ESRB's ongoing outreach efforts will be asked to submit their company name, the number of stores operated by such company, and contact information such as contact name, mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address. This information will be stored for purposes of developing a relationship with retailers and helping them educate consumers about the ESRB rating system. Retailers who order collateral materials (e.g., brochures, posters, etc.) through our site may be asked for shipping information.
  *  **General Information Contained in Email**  
ESRB's website provides a number of links through which an online visitor can e-mail us. ESRB collects personal information contained in the e-mail for the purpose of responding to a consumer's questions and/or comments.



No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives.
