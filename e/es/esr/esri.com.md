# ESRI Web Site Privacy Statement

ESRI respects the privacy of every individual who visits our Web sites or responds to our interactive advertisements. This Privacy Statement outlines the information ESRI collects via its various Web sites and how we use that information. This Statement will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your personal information collected or shared when you visit ESRI's Web sites or respond to our advertisements.

### Personally Identifiable Information

ESRI collects personally identifiable information such as your name, address, telephone number, or E-mail address **only** if you provide that information to us voluntarily.

The voluntary information we collect is used for internal review and to notify visitors about updates to our Web site. We will contact you or send you information about our software or services **only** if you request that we do. If you have given us permission to do so, we will pass your information to one of our [Business Partners](https://web.archive.org/partners/index.html) to contact you about software or services. **We will not forward your information unless you request that we do so.**

Otherwise, ESRI generally will not disclose your personally identifiable information unless required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of ESRI.

**ArcData Online**  
When you buy data through ArcData Online that has been provided by a third party, such as GDT or HTI, you license the data directly from the data provider. For this reason we make the customer information necessary to create the license available to the data provider. This information includes the name, organization, and E-mail address of the customer and is used to track active data licenses and provide customer support.

### Information Collected Automatically

We collect your domain name (such as esri.com), the type of Internet browser you use, and the operating system you use automatically. This information is used **only** for internal review to help us improve the content of our Web page. The information is not shared with any other company or used by ESRI to contact clients.

### Children

ESRI does not intentionally collect personally identifiable information such as name, address, telephone number, or E-mail address from children. However, users of any age can download our free software or take one of our online training courses, both of which require a name and E-mail address.

If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information and the parent or guardian of that child would like that information deleted from our records, the parent or guardian should contact us at [webmaster@esri.com](mailto:webmaster@esri.com). We will use reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our existing files.

### Information We May Place Automatically On Your Computer's Hard Drive

Some of our Web sites store some information on your computer in the form of a "cookie." These are used to store information you provide to prevent you from having to enter that same information repeatedly and to help us collect minimal information to maintain and improve our site.

**Cookies cannot be used to collect personal information about you, to collect information from your files, or to do damage to your files.** A cookie is a single line of code with very limited functions. For more information about cookies, we recommend visiting <http://www.ciac.org/ciac/bulletins/i-034.shtml>.

With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.

### Links to Other Web sites

The ESRI site offers links to hundreds of GIS-related Web sites. ESRI assumes no responsibility for the information practices of these sites, and these links do not imply affiliation or endorsement of the linked sites. 

### Removing Your Information from Our Databases

If you do not wish to receive E-mail or postal notifications about our software, services, or special promotions, please let us know by sending E-mail to us at [webmaster@esri.com](mailto:webmaster@esri.com) and specifying us that you do not want to receive these notifications. Please provide us with your exact name and address as well as a description of the publication or mail piece you received. We will use reasonable efforts to delete this information from our existing files.
