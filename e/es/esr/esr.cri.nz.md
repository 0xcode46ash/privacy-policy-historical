# About us - Privacy Policy

##### Modern information and communication technologies play a fundamental role in the activities of organisations today. These technologies can impact on your personal privacy.

Information transmitted over the Internet is inherently insecure, unless pages use encryption to protect the information during transmission. 

#### Anonymous access

ESR is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. You can access and browse our website without disclosing your personal information. Any information automatically retrieved during your visit, such as browser type and pages visited, is anonymous and is used for statistical analysis of the use of this site. We do not automatically log personal information and no data on individual visitors is saved in any format.

#### What information do we collect?

We only collect information that you actively give us by emailing your personal details to [Marketing and Communications](mailto:alison.corich@esr.cri.nz?subject=Information%20submission) or giving your personal details to a member of our staff.

Periodically we will check that you still want us to retain your information and that it is up to date. You can at any time request that your information be removed from our database.
