# Esquire:Privacy

This site complies with the following Privacy Policy. We can be reached by e-mail at [webmaster@esquiremag.com](mailto:webmaster@esquiremag.com). 

This site collects no personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. In addition, we may place a "cookie" in the browser files of a user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information although it will enable us to relate a user's use of our sites to information that the user has specifically and knowingly provided to us. 

A user's personally identifying information may be used for editorial purposes and we may also use such information for marketing and promotional purposes and may share the information with others if the user has not advised us of his or her preference not to be included in such an exchange. This information may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from our records and other sources. Individuals always have the ability to stop their personal information being used for such purposes by sending an e-mail request to us at the address given above. 

The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by L90, our Web advertising partner. In the course of delivering an ad to you, L90 does not collect personally identifiable information about you. In other words, L90 does not collect information, such as your name, address, phone number or email address. However, L90 does collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), the server your computer is logged into, the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for instance) and whether you responded to the ad delivered. Like most Internet sites, L90 uses "cookies" to enhance the Internet user's experience on the Web. L90 cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way, and these cookies in no way damage your system or files. If you would like to know more about L90's information gathering practices, "opt out" procedures and how to disable cookies, click [here.](http://www.l90.com/corporate/privacy_policy/index.html)

While we will seek to require third parties with whom we have agreements to follow appropriate privacy policies, we do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties. 

Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. 

Children should ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to us or anyone else over the Internet. Users can send e-mail to us at [webmaster@esquiremag.com](mailto:webmaster@esquiremag.com) with any further questions.
