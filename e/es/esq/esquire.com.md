This site complies with the following Privacy Policy. We can be reached by e-mail at [webmaster@esquiremag.com](mailto:webmaster@esquiremag.com). 

This site collects no personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. In addition, we may place a "cookie" in the browser files of a user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information although it will enable us to relate a user's use of our sites to information that the user has specifically and knowingly provided to us. 

A user's personally identifying information may be used for editorial purposes and we may also use such information for marketing and promotional purposes and may share the information with others if the user has not advised us of his or her preference not to be included in such an exchange. This information may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from our records and other sources. Individuals always have the ability to stop their personal information being used for such purposes by sending an e-mail request to us at the address given above.

We will only share your e-mail address if you have opted in by checking the box on the registration page. Additionally, each email our partners send you will include a description of the simple opt out process to enable you to stop receiving future e-mail.
