We know you care about your personal privacy. Because we care about you we have adopted the practices described in this Privacy Policy.**

Covered Website

This Privacy Policy applies to use of our online income tax preparation service. It does not apply to other portions of our website or to services offered through our office locations.

The Information We Collect

We collect your tax related information such as your name, address, income, birth date, social security number, employment and other information necessary to prepare and electronically file your tax return. You also provide to us your Username, Password, Password Prompt Question, e-mail address and telephone number as part of the registration process to use this service. We also collect the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from which the return originated (see discussion under “URL and IP Address” below). If you pay by credit card, we also collect your credit card type, number, and expiration date. If you pay by e-check or request direct deposit of your tax refund, we collect the bank name, and bank account and routing number. 

The Way We Use Information

The tax return information that we collect is used to prepare and, if requested, electronically file your tax return. The tax return information is used only as authorized by you or as allowed by law.

The IRS requires us to provide to them the IP address of the computer from which the return originated, as well as the e-mail address of the person who electronically filed the return.

Your credit card information or bank account information will be shared with credit card processing companies to bill you for services purchased.

The information you give us also allows us to statistically analyze Site usage, improve our content and product offerings and customize our Site's content, layout and services. 

We will send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, we might send you an e-mail announce the start of the IRS filing season and our service each year, the filing status and result for your tax return, actions required to complete your e-file, or if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance. 

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications because our tax e-file services include e-file, processing, submission, result analysis and possibly resubmission required for the tax return. Without these communication, you may not find out if the tax return has been accepted by the IRS or not, resulting in refund delay or other difficulties. 

We will send you tax related information in a newsletter to your email address if you have authorized it.

Choice/Opt-Out

If you do not wish to receive tax information, including the newsletter, you may opt-out of receiving it by following the instructions included in each email or on the Update Profile page by visiting the following URL: <https://libertytax.esmarttax.com/ChangePersonalProfile.asp>.
