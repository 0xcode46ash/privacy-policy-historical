Our Collection and Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information.

We collect and use information about you where we reasonably believe it will help us administer our business or provide products, services or other opportunities to you. The information you give us allows us to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze Site usage, improve our content and product offerings and customize our Site's content, layout and Services. Because of the nature of our business our products and services are not designed to appeal to minors, we do not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children. 

It will be necessary for you to provide your birthday, social security number, employment, income and related tax payment information for our software to compute and complete your tax return for e-file. We use tax return information only in accordance with applicable laws and in order to provide the tax return and electronic filing or other services you have requested. Except as described herein we do not disclose tax return information to third parties nor use it to market third parties' products and services. For our records, we may, in our sole discretion, retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, troubleshooting and agreement enforcement. 

C&S collects information from our users at several different points, including but not limited to the following:

>  Before you can use the Services (as defined in the User Agreement) on the Site, we ask that you register with C&S and provide to us your Username, e-mail address, Password, Name, Address, Phone Number, Password Prompt Question and Answer. We receive and may store the information you provide to us. Certain information, such as your name and your password must be given to us to access the Site. Other information may be identified as optional, and you may choose whether to provide it.
