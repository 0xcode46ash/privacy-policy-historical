# Privacy Policy

eSkill Corporation (hereafter «eSkill» or «we») understands the power that the Internet holds for changing your life and making things easier for you. These benefits are at risk if people are concerned about their personal privacy. We are committed to providing you with an Internet experience that respects and protects your personal privacy choices and concerns.

## 1\. Information gathered

Information can be collected from the users and the users’ test takers at several different points on our website.

## 1.1 General Information

In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively. We only use such information anonymously and in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you.  
We may share this information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how eSkill visitors use our site, and create a better overall experience for you, as well.

## 1.2 Personal Information

To sign up for eSkill’s services we ask to provide certain data including: name, address, phone number, email address, contact name and credit card information (note that this last information will not be stored by eSkill only transaction histories are kept).  
eSkill administrator and test-taker functionalities requests the test takers to provide the following contact information: full name and email address (hereafter «test taker personal information»). This information is only used to contact the test taker when necessary and for storage purposes.  
Note that for the test taker personal information received from Europe and covered by the Directive 95/46/EC or received from Switzerland, eSkill applies and adheres to the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and to the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, which both includes 7 Principles and 15 FAQs for the protection of this information. This only applies to information received after eSkill joined the Safe Harbor Frameworks by self-certification. eSkill will provide, upon request, the verification statement that needs to be done at least once a year (according to FAQ 7). This statement confirms that eSkill effectively adheres to the US-EU Safe Harbor or to the US-Swiss Safe Harbor, as the case might be, and that it has been duly implemented in its organization.
