# Privacy Policy

eSkill Corporation (hereafter “eSkill” or “we”) understands the power that the Internet holds for changing your life and making things easier for you. These benefits are at risk if people are concerned about their personal privacy. We are committed to providing you with an Internet experience that respects and protects your personal privacy choices and concerns.

## 1\. Information Gathered

Information can be collected from the users and the users’ test takers at several different points on our website.

### 1.1 General Information

In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively. We use such information only anonymously and in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you.

We may share this information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too can understand how eSkill visitors use our site, and so that we can create a better overall experience for you as well.

### 1.2 Personal Information

When you sign up for eSkill’s services, we will need certain data, including name, address, phone number, email address, contact name and payment information. Note that credit card information is not stored by eSkill; only transaction histories are kept.

eSkill administrator and test-taker functionalities request that the test takers provide the following contact information: full name and email address (hereafter “test taker personal information”). This information is used only to contact the test taker when necessary and for storage purposes.

**Important note:**  
The personal information received from test takers in EU countries is protected by the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and by the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework.

Since the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework was invalidated by the October 6, 2015, decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission have reached an agreement on a Privacy Shield for the transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S.

The process of approving the text of the new EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is not yet complete, but eSkill is monitoring the details of the agreement and will comply with the new Privacy Shield once it is approved by the regulatory authorities.

In the meantime, eSkill will continue to protect test takers’ personal information by following the EU Model Contract Clauses.

### 1.3 Application

The following sections apply to both general and personal information collected by eSkill unless otherwise specified.

## 2\. Legal Disclaimer

### 2.1 Principle

We do not disclose information to any outside parties for any reason whatsoever.

### 2.2 Exceptions

We can share aggregated general information with our partners solely for the purpose set out in Section 1.1.

We may disclose information when required by law, a court, or a government order, or when such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process serviced on our website. In this case, we will promptly inform the client or test taker of the potential disclosure or disclosures.

## 3\. Information Use

### 3.1 Principle

eSkill is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from those that have been disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

eSkill will not use the information for any other reasons than those that have been disclosed in this document. The purposes of the data collection are described in Sections 1.1 and 1.2.

### 3.2 Exception for Troubleshooting

We may use your Internet protocol (I.P.) address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website.  
An I.P. address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your Internet service provider or through your company’s local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN).

## 4\. Information Safeguard and Access

### 4.1 Safeguard

eSkill will record and retain all information collected from the test takers for four years from the last use or last service provided. After this time period, the information will be erased from eSkill’s system.

At any time before the expiration date, the test taker can request the removal of his/her personal information, and eSkill will do so within a reasonable time frame. This request should be made via email using the email address provided in the **Contact Information** section.

### 4.2 Access

The test taker can also, at any time, request via email to have access to the personal information stored by eSkill. eSkill will reply to this request by the same means within a reasonable time frame.

The test taker can reply back to submit any amendments or corrections to his/her personal information or to request the erasure of such information as mentioned in the paragraph above. eSkill will respond to this request within a reasonable time frame.

## 5\. Security

### 5.1 Security Policy

We operate secure data networks protected by industry-standard firewalls and password protection. We have security measures in place, such as an organizational security policy, to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the user and test taker data under our control. eSkill performs a security audit twice a year and follows PCI security policy. The compliance with this last policy is also verified twice a year through monitoring.

### 5.2 Limited Access

Only certain employees have access to the information you provide us. We impose strict rules on our employees who have access to either the databases that store user and test taker information or the servers that host our services. All of our employees must follow organizational security policies and all of them are bound by a confidentiality agreement.

### 5.3 Prevention

While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, disclosure, or alteration of data will not occur, eSkill takes reasonable precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.

## 6\. Enforcement of Personal Information Privacy

This section applies to Personal Information solely as described in Section 1.2.

### 6.1 Mechanisms for Complaint

After the test taker has exercised their rights under Sections 4.1 and 4.2 related to the modification and removal of his/her personal information, and either 1) the test taker, for whatever reason, is not satisfied or 2) the test taker believes that eSkill did not fulfill its obligation to act within a reasonable time frame, the test taker can send a complaint to [info@eskill.com](mailto:info@eskill.com). eSkill will promptly reply to such a complaint and will attempt in good faith to resolve the complaint with the test taker if founded. Test takers can also address their complaint to the BBB (Better Business Bureau), since eSkill is a BBB-accredited business.

## 7\. Links

### 7.1 Email Links

eSkill provides email address links throughout its site so you can email us directly with any questions or comments you may have. We read all messages received and make an effort to respond promptly. In addition to replying to your comment or inquiry, we may also file your email regarding improvements to our website for future reference.

### 7.2 Links to Other Websites

eSkill contains links to other websites. These sites have their own policies and practices with respect to online privacy, and eSkill cannot be held responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these websites.

## 8\. Opting Out

Many of the services available on our site provide you with the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from our partners and from us.

## 9\. Surveys and Contests

From time to time, eSkill requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose the information.

Information requested may include contact information (such as a name and email address) and demographic information (such as a zip code). Contact information will be used to notify winners and award prizes.

Survey information will be used for the purpose of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

## 10\. Notification of Changes

This policy may be revised from time to time as new features are added to the website. We will post these changes so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Please check this site for information about revisions to our privacy policy.

We will notify you directly if there is a material change in our privacy practices. We will take commercially reasonable measures to obtain written or active email consent from the user or test taker if we will be using the information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection. We will also post the changes in our privacy statement 30 days prior to a change unless the change is to the user’s advantage.
