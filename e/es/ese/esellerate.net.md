**About this statement**  
This statement describes the privacy policy for the eSellerate web site. By accessing this site, you agree to the terms of the eSellerate Online Privacy Policy, as outlined below. If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via e-mail. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also e-mail users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. 

**COLLECTION OF INFORMATION**

> **From software publishers and their customers**  
>  Anyone may use the eSellerate web site to create a free publisher evaluation account. At that time, the publisher will need to enter a login name and password, which will enable secure access to the account through the web-based eSellerate Sales Manager. The publisher will also need to enter company name and address and the primary contact's name, e-mail address and phone number. This information will be used to contact the publisher concerning interest in our services. If the publisher later becomes a licensed eSellerate user, this information will be used to administer the publisher's account and notify the publisher about updates to the eSellerate system. 
> 
> The publisher may optionally enter name, e-mail address and phone number for shipping, billing and payment contacts. This contact information is used by the eSellerate system for the various business functions. Additionally, e-mail addresses may be entered to receive automated sales reports. This allows multiple individuals to track activity of the publisher account. 
> 
> During the software delivery process, eSellerate will collect the customer's name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone number. (Company name is optional.) The customer may also indicate a preference to receive the publisher's product update information. When applicable, the purchaser's credit card number and expiration date will also be collected. This information will be used to process orders and provide order notification. 
> 
> **From affiliates and portals**  
>  eSellerate offers affiliate and portal programs that enable other web sites to direct sales to an eSellerate publisher's web stores. eSellerate will collect the following information about parties that sign up for either of these programs: company name, address and web site URL and the primary contact's name, e-mail address and phone number. This information will be used to process the orders generated by the affiliate or portal and to provide order notification to the appropriate parties. 
> 
> eSellerate archives system-generated, event-driven e-mails for events such as new processing rate notifications. This information is collected for archival purposes only. 
> 
> **Newsgroups and forums reminder**  
>  Participants in eSellerate newsgroups and forums should remember that any personal information they disclose in these areas is available for public display, and may be collected and used by unknown parties. 

**How eSellerate protects this information**  
First, eSellerate takes several security measures to protect all collected information in storage. For example, access to a publisher, affiliate or portal account requires a special login name and password. Additionally, all information transmitted between the eSellerate servers and the customer is encrypted. For further customer protection, eSellerate does not store complete credit card numbers after the transaction. 

**Disclosure of information**  
While making every effort to preserve user privacy, eSellerate may need to disclose personal information when required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on the eSellerate web site. 

**Use of cookies**  
To access the eSellerate web site, the visitor's browser must be set to allow cookies. eSellerate uses cookies to identify the visitor during that visit to the site. Cookies are used on a per-session basis only, and are not stored on the visitor's computer. Depending on the browser, the visitor may be able to use separate security settings for per-session cookies and cookies that are stored. 

**Use of log files**  
eSellerate automatically logs the following information about visitors to this web site: IP addresses, browser type, domain names, access times and the number of hits to specific pages within the site. This information is used to administer the site and to evaluate its usability. This information is not used to create any type of personal profiles for the visitors. 

**eSellerate Privacy Guarantee**  
eSellerate will not provide publisher, customer, affiliate or portal information to third parties. Accordingly, only the publisher and our credit card processor have access to a given customer's address information. 

eSellerate does not control how our publishers use their customers' personally identifiable information. Therefore, customers should read the publisher's privacy policy before providing personally identifiable information. Customers also should note that eSellerate's TRUSTe certification applies only to www.esellerate.net, and does not extend to our publishers. Also, eSellerate's certification covers only information collected through this web site, and does not cover information collected through our publishers' software, which can be downloaded from this site. 

**OPT-OUT INFORMATION**

> **For publishers**  
>  From time to time, eSellerate will offer supplemental information about products and services. Each publisher has the option to receive this information, which will never be sent without permission.
