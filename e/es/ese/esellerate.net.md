# Privacy Statement

**eSellerate’s Online Privacy Policy**

This statement describes the privacy policy for the eSellerate web site. By accessing this site, you agree to the terms of the eSellerate Online Privacy Policy, as outlined below. If you do not agree to these terms,  
you should not access this site. In addition, eSellerate may occasionally change the Online Privacy Policy. The revisions will always be posted on this page.

**Collection of publisher and customer information  
**You can use the eSellerate web site to create a free evaluation account. At that time, we will collect company name and address and the primary contact's name, e-mail address and phone number. We will use this information to administer your account and notify you about updates to the eSellerate system. We will also ask you to enter a login name and password. These will enable access to your account through the web-based eSellerate Sales Manager.

Before you can sell software with the eSellerate system, we require a signed license agreement. During the software delivery process, we will collect customer information on your behalf. This information includes name, e-mail address and mailing address. You can access this information through the Sales Manager. When necessary to process an order, we will also collect the purchaser's credit card number and expiration date. We only keep these numbers long enough to complete the transaction.

**How we protect this information  
**First, we take several security measures to protect your publisher and customer information in storage. For example, access to your publisher account requires a special login name and password. Additionally, all information transmitted between the eSellerate servers and your customer is encrypted. For further customer protection, we do not store complete credit card numbers after the transaction.

eSellerate will not provide any of your publisher or customer information to other parties without your permission. However, we may need to provide your customer's name and delivery address to a third party for shipping purposes. Similarly, we will share your customer’s credit card information with companies that authorize and process such transactions.

**Use of cookies  
**To access the eSellerate web site, your browser must be set to allow cookies. We use cookies to identify you during your visit to the site. We use cookies on a per-session basis only, and do not store them on your computer. Depending on your browser, you may be able to use separate security settings for per-session cookies and cookies that are stored.

**How to update your publisher information  
**You can access and modify your publisher information at any time. Just login to the eSellerate Sales Manager and click one of the links in the Account Info box. When you finish making any modifications, click Save Changes.
