# esure : privacy and security

| We recognise our responsibility to treat the information we obtain about you with care.  
  | We use personal information about you  
  |   
  |   
Some of the personal information we ask you to provide may be sensitive. You may have to give us information about your physical health and the physical health of other people who will be insured to drive your car. We also need to know about any motoring offences that you and other people who will be insured to drive your car may have. If you buy one of our policies then we will treat you as having given us consent to use any sensitive personal data in connection with the administration of your policy.  
  |   
We participate in a number of insurance industry initiatives to prevent and detect crime. This includes the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register and the Motor Insurance Database.  
  |   
Insurers pass information to the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register run by Insurance Database Services Ltd, and the Motor Insurance Anti Fraud and Theft Register, run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI). The aim is to check the information provided and also prevent fraudulent claims. When we deal with your request for insurance we may search these registers. Under the conditions of your policy, you must tell us about any incident (such as an accident or theft), which may or may not give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to it to the registers. Your insurance cover details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database, run by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre (MIIC). This has been set up to identify uninsured drivers, and may be searched by the Police to help confirm who is insured to drive. If there is an accident, the Database may be used by Insurers, MIIC and the Motor Insurers Bureau to identify relevant policy information. You can ask us for more information about this and you should show this notice to anyone insured to drive the vehicle covered under your policy.

We may share information with HBOS Group companies and other carefully selected organisations. We, or they, may contact you by mail, email or telephone to let you know about other goods or services which may interest you.  
  |   
If you do not want to receive this information, please write to Customer Services, esure at the Observatory, Reigate, Surrey, RH2 0SG, or email [customer.services@esure.com](mailto:customer.services@esure.com). You have the right to ask for a copy of the information held by us in our records but we may ask you to pay a small fee. You also have the right to ask us to correct any inaccuracies in your information. You can contact the Data Protection Officer at [dpo@esure.com](mailto:dpo@esure.com), or write to Data Protection Officer, esure at the Observatory, Reigate, Surrey, RH2 0SG, if you want to know more about our use of your personal information.

Telephone calls  
  |   
We may record telephone conversations to offer you additional security, resolve complaints and improve our service standards. Conversations may also be monitored for staff training purposes.  
  |   
Security  
  |   
We believe that security is of the utmost importance to our customers, and we therefore have what we believe are the most secure systems on the market.  
  |   
We use the latest encryption technology, SSL or Secure Socket Layer, which protects your payment details and all your personal information. We are also registered with Verisign, a leading Internet Security Company. To verify the site security click on the Verisign logo below and this will immediately display our registration certificate. This is proof of our commitment to ensuring your security.  
  |   
  
  |   
If you pay for your policy by credit card (but not by debit card), then you will also have the additional protection of the Consumer Credit Act. Your maximum liability on your credit card is £50 in the event that it is lost or stolen or used fraudulently and your liability stops as soon as you notify the credit card company that the card has been lost or stolen or used fraudulently.
