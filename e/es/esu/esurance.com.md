### Our use and disclosure of information

At Esurance, we gather information about you that may be used to process and service your insurance policy, settle your claims and offer you additional products and services that we think may be of interest to you, and as permitted or directed by you. Some of this may be nonpublic, personal information (information not available to the general public) that is provided by you, that we gather from transactions and communications with you, through services performed for you, that we obtain from third parties, or that we obtain through other means, all as permitted by law.

### Information we disclose

The above-described types of personal and other types of information about our current, former, or potential customers may be disclosed, but only as permitted or required by law, or as permitted or directed by the customer or consumer.

We may disclose such information to affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies, insurance agents, reinsurance companies, and insurance support organizations, such as consumer reporting agencies, government entities, and claims administrators. We may also disclose information to unaffiliated third parties that perform services or functions on our behalf including the marketing of our products or services. Further, we may also disclose information as necessary to affect, administer, or enforce a transaction that you request or authorize.

The following are examples of situations in which we may disclose information:

  * We provide your policy information to adjusters and other appropriate business entities that make any necessary repairs to your vehicle when you are involved in a claim.
  * We may provide your information to others whom we determine need such information to perform insurance or other professional functions for us. These may include parties helping us with administrative services and consumer reporting agencies.
  * We may supply information as required by search warrant, subpoena, or legal process to state insurance departments or other law enforcement or government authorities when required by law, or to protect our own legal interests in the event of suspected illegal or fraudulent activities.
  * If we collect your information as an agent for one of our business partners, we may use it to contact you or make you an offer regarding auto insurance that may be of interest to you.



All of the unaffiliated entities with which we may share your information are required to keep the information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which it was shared, except as otherwise permitted by law.
