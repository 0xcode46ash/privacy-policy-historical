The purpose of the Privacy Policy is to explain how ESUPERFUND collects, maintains, uses and discloses your personal information. It also states how this information is used, updated and made available to those parties eligible to access it. It provides some detail about the rights that clients have in respect of their personal information. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, any reference to "ESUPERFUND", "we", "us" or "our" refers to ESUPERFUND Pty Ltd (AFSL 340762) in its capacity as Trustee of the ESUPERFUND Trust (ABN 37 842 535 715) and other related companies.

## How we collect and hold your personal information

You provide ESUPERFUND with your personal information when you ask for information about ESUPERFUND's services, when you access and use the ESUPERFUND website, and/or when you submit an application with ESUPERFUND. 

By accessing this website or by submitting an application with ESUPERFUND, you consent to ESUPERFUND collecting, maintaining, using and disclosing personal information about you and provided by you or by another person as described below.

If you give us personal information about another person, you represent that you are authorised to do so and agree to inform that person who we are, that we will use and disclose that information for the relevant purposes set out below, and that they can access the information we hold about them.

We are required by law to collect information to identify and verify you. ESUPERFUND may make enquiries as to your identity(ies) and other personal details. For instance we may ask for identification such as your name, address and date of birth. 

The Privacy Act also protects your sensitive information. While ESUPERUFND usually does not need to collect, use or disclose sensitive information about you (such as health information), if we require such information we will only collect it with your consent, except where otherwise permitted by law.

We collect statistical information about visitors to our websites such as the number of visitors, pages viewed, types of transactions conducted, time online and documents downloaded. This information is used to evaluate and improve the performance of our websites. Other than statistical information, we do not collect any information about you through our website unless you provide the information to us.

You should also be aware that we use cookies on our websites. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identification number or value that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookies to your browser if your browser allows it. However, to protect your privacy, your browser only allows a website to access the cookies it has sent to your computer.

When cookies are used on our websites, they are used to collect the statistical information referred to above in addition to allowing you to access your account online. When you access your account online, a cookie will be created which uniquely identifies your computer and your username and password. This means that you do not have to re-enter those details each time you want to access your account online.

Most internet browsers are set up to accept cookies. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may be able to change the settings of your browser to refuse all cookies or to have your computer notify you each time a cookie is sent to it, and thereby give yourself the choice whether to accept it or not. If you reject all cookies, you will be unable to access your account online. You can also delete cookies from your computer after they have been created.

## Use of the information by ESUPERFUND
