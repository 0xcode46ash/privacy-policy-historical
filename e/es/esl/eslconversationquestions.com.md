ESL Conversation Questions uses Google Analytics reports to better understand visitor behavior to better serve the needs of our visitors.

ESL Conversation Questions uses this data to better understand it’s audience and to improve product development. ESL Conversation Questions will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected from Display Advertising features that is based on the DoubleClick cookie unless ESL Conversation Questions has robust notice of, and the user’s prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger. Using the [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads), visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads.

Google also has a browser addon to opt-out of Google Analytics which can be found [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).
