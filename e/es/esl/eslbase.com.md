We are committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining the security of any personal information received from you. We strictly adhere to the requirements of data protection legislation in the UK in the use, storage and disclosure of information which you have given us and which we collect about you. 

The purpose of this statement is to explain to you what information we collect, and how and why we collect it. 

**When you register with Eslbase**   
We collect information about you when you register with us. We ask you for your name and email address and to tell us whether you are a teacher or an employer/training centre. We use this information to provide you with the most appropriate features and resources when you sign into your account. You can check, update or remove this information on your [account page](https://web.archive.org/members/account.php). We may also use this information to contact you from time to time, but only if you consent to us doing so during the registration process. 

**When you register with the Eslbase forum**   
You can also register with the [forum](https://web.archive.org/forum/). In this case we ask you for a username and an email address. Once you have registered you can choose to provide more information about yourself in your account area, for example your interests, birth date and location. In all cases you have the option of what information in your account is publicly displayed. You can change these options and update or remove your personal information by signing into your [forum account](https://web.archive.org/forum/ucp.php?mode=login). You also have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically generated emails from the [phpBB](http://www.phpbb.com/) software which powers the forum. 

**When you submit information in a form**   
We collect information that you submit voluntarily through forms, for example when you add a comment to a page, post in the forum or post a job advert. Any information that you submit voluntarily in this way will be available for other visitors to see. For example, if you include your email address or other personal information in an advert or comment, this will be visible to other visitors.
