# Privacy Policy | eSpares

**eSpares** are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998). We collect information about you for 2 reasons: firstly, to process your order and secondly to provide you with the best service possible. We will not email you in the future unless you have given us your consent. We will give you the chance to refuse any marketing email from us in the future. 

The type of information we will collect about you when you place an order or register on our web site includes: 

  * Address
  * Phone number
  * Email address
  * Credit/debit card details



This information is already stored on our internal systems and our website simply verifies you as a customer of eSpares (and their associated trading brands). We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. The information we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check the information that we hold about you by emailing us. If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly. The personal information that we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the law. We will not transfer your information outside the EEA (European Economic Area). We may use technology to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to our site. If you have any questions/comments about privacy, you should email us at [privacy@espares.co.uk](mailto:privacy@espares.co.uk). 

We use the information you provide for the following purposes:

  * To improve the design and content of the espares.co.uk website

You can at any stage change your privacy details by logging in to [Your Account](https://www.espares.co.uk/account) or [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/contact/customerservices). 

When you place an order we need to know your name, email address, delivery address, credit or debit card number and the card's expiry date. This allows us to process and fulfil your order and to notify you of the status of your request. We may also ask for your telephone number which enables us or our contractor to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your order. 

## Your Consent

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. 

## Data Security

We have designed our site to protect the information we collect online from unauthorised access. We safeguard your private information by implementing the appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedure necessary to protect your privacy. To further protect your security, we also take the reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to your personal profile or making data changes. We are committed to protecting your privacy and have security measures in place to prevent unauthorised access to and disclosure of your personal information. 

## Improving Our Service

eSpares does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. To better tailor our services to our customers' needs, we use non-identifying and aggregate information to help us make decisions on how to improve eSpares. We also share this generic information with our advertisers and other interested, reputable parties with whom we have established a formal business relationship. For example, we may tell advertisers which areas of the site have received the most customer traffic overall, or more specifically, how many customer types have visited certain pages. However, we do not disclose the identifying information of individual customers with advertisers. We also do not use or share the personally identifiable information submitted to us by any other means without providing our customers the choice to opt-out or otherwise bar such unrelated uses. 

## Cookies

Cookies are pieces of information left in the settings of your web browser to identify your computer to a website when you return. Whenever a website welcomes you and tailors data to your specifications, it is reading a cookie left in your browser and identifying information you may have registered during previous visits, such as your viewing preferences. 

## International Privacy

The above privacy statement may not be applicable in all countries of eSpares visitors or registered community users, as security policies may vary according to the individual Internet laws in each host country.
