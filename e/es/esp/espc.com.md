# ESPC Homeline

**Introduction**

ESPC (UK) collates information from registered visitors to the Homeline website with a view to enhancing the services offered, as well as to improve the on-line experience. Naturally, we take privacy very seriously, and this policy sets out details of the personal information we collect, in addition to the ways in which we may use that information. 

**Collecting personal information**

ESPC (UK) collects personal information when you register to become a Homeline customer.

**The purpose of collecting personal information**

If you are a registered customer, we may use personal information for the following reasons:

  * Informing you of any service-related changes which may affect your use of Homeline, or to let you know about any new features or functionality (e.g. the introduction of a new e-mail or chat service). 
  * Contacting you to ask whether you would like to attend a research group to help us improve our service. 



**Passing details to other companies**

If you opt to receive information from other companies, we may sometimes disclose your personal details to those companies in question. We will only do so, however, where those companies have undertaken not to use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide you with information. If you decide that you no longer wish to receive information from a particular company, you should contact that company directly. Please note that any subsequent personal information given to another company will be used according to that company's privacy policy; the ESPC (UK) policy will no longer apply.

**Third party sites**

Our privacy policy does not apply to third party sites that you may access from the ESPC site. You should ensure, therefore, that you are familiar with the applicable privacy policy before entering any personal information on a third party site.

**Updating and amending your personal information**

As a registered customer, you have control over the accuracy of your personal information. If, at any time, you wish to verify, update or amend the personal information you have given to Homeline, you can do so on-line by clicking on "Update my Details" on your personal Homeline home page.

**Changes to Privacy Policy**

First and foremost, we recognise the importance of privacy to our customers and visitors, and intend to remain at the cutting edge of industry developments in this area. We will keep this policy under review, and any changes made from time to time will be posted on this page.

**Consent**

By disclosing your personal information to us, or by continuing as a customer if you have already registered, you indicate your consent to the collection, storage, processing and use of your personal information by ESPC (UK) as described in this privacy policy
