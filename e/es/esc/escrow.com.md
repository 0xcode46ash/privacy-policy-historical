# Escrow.com

Along with providing members with safe and secure ways to conduct online transactions, we are fully committed to protecting our members' privacy and personal information. This privacy policy applies to services provided by us (including our subsidiaries and affiliates) at our web site, located at Escrow.com, as well as in conjunction with our partners' web sites.

**A Special Note About Children**

Our services are not directed towards minors nor do we encourage minors to use our services. Minors are not eligible to use our services and should not submit any personal information to us.

**Collection of User Information**

We only require our members to submit information necessary to use the services offered through our web site or our partners' web sites. This information includes your name, e-mail address, your mother's maiden name (for password verification only), address, phone number and payment information (which may include credit card, contact, and banking information).

From time to time, members of Escrow.com will be given the option to participate in online surveys. Participation is always at your option. The information gathered from our surveys will only be used to enhance our members' experience, and to help us identify services and needs which may be valuable to our members in the future.

Members of Escrow.com may also be given an opportunity to participate in contests and promotions which may also require information from our users. The information provided will only be used to notify winners and conduct the promotion. Participation in these contests and promotions is always at your option.

**Use and Disclosure of Personal Information**

  * Use of your information: We use personal information from our users solely to provide and enhance our services. For example, we use personal information to verify the identities of buyers, sellers, and brokers; process the transaction, verify receipt of payment, and confirm shipping information. These uses include, but are not limited to, sharing your information with other companies (such as your credit card company or banking institution) and exchanging your information with the other party to your transaction. We may also request information about you from third parties to provide our services. We also use personal information internally to improve our services.


  * Restriction on Disclosure of Your Information by Us: We will not sell, publish, disclose, or rent to third parties individually identifiable user information collected at our web site, through our servers or otherwise obtained by us, other than to provide our services and as set forth in this privacy policy. From time to time, however, we may collect and/or disclose, transfer or share aggregated demographic or usage information obtained by us.


  * Relationship with Our Partner Web Sites: Our services are often offered through other web sites that are partnered with us and our technology is often integrated with the offerings of such partnered web sites. For example, you may have accessed our services while making a purchase on another web site where the product was offered. Our partners may obtain other personal information about you through their web sites or otherwise through your access and use of their service and product offerings that are not used in connection with our services. The use, privacy and security of such information are not within our control and shall not be our responsibility, and shall be subject to your agreements with such partner, if any. Our partners are generally required to forward to us all information about you that is necessary for us to provide our services. In most cases, we have joint ownership with our partners of your information. We do not guarantee and are not responsible for any use of your information by our partners that would otherwise be in violation of this privacy policy. You should consult the policies of such partners. We also generally share user information with our partners to improve our services and our partners' services.


  * Disclosure of Information to Protect our Rights and Comply with Applicable Law: We cooperate fully with all law enforcement inquiries and with third parties to enforce their intellectual property and other rights. We also comply fully with all applicable laws; including all applicable laws related to providing escrow services. We may disclose, in our reasonable judgment, user information as required to fully comply with all such actions and laws in the course of conducting our business. We may also disclose your information and communications to protect our rights or prevent liability to us. In such event, your private communications and personally identifiable information may be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this privacy policy.


  * Passwords and Our Confidential Information: We require that you do not disclose or share your password or other identifying information we provide to you with anyone else. Such passwords and information are our property and your use may be revoked by us at our discretion. You are also prohibited from using any password other than ones we authorize you to use.



**Use and Disclosure of Transaction Information**

The terms and conditions of any transaction facilitated by Escrow.com shall be considered confidential information and, as between the parties to a transaction and Escrow.com, Escrow.com will not disclose the terms to outside parties without the written consent of all of the parties to any transaction.

**Our Use of Cookies**

Cookies are data that are stored by your browser on your computer. For example, if you choose the option of saving your username when you Sign In, a cookie is used to store this information. Cookies are required to track your session when you are working with a transaction.

**Security**

With the understanding that perfect security does not exist on the Internet, we employ industry standard technologies to protect our users' information, including firewalls and secure socket layers. We also have appropriate off-line security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect the privacy of your personal information. So long as we employ reasonable security measures, we are not responsible for any unauthorized loss or disclosure of your information. Moreover, we are not responsible for the disclosure of your information by our partners or by other companies not under our control.

**Changes to Your Account**

Escrow.com gives you the ability to change or edit your personal information contained in your profile. Additionally, Escrow.com gives you the opportunity to deactivate your account if you choose. Contact us by filling out the customer support form and request the deactivation of your account. If you have active transactions open, your account will be deactivated after your transactions have been resolved.

We reserve the right to retain information after you have deactivated your account or information that you have requested to be removed in order to comply with applicable law, resolve disputes, and enforce our rights.

**Revisions to this Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy from time to time without notice to you. If at any time we decide to substantially change the manner in which we collect or use personally identifiable information, we will inform our members by posting a prominent announcement on our home page. However, your personal information will always be used in accordance with the privacy policy in effect at the time the information was collected.
