# About the ESC - Privacy Policy

The ESC respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the confidentiality of your personal information. This policy explains how the ESC collects and uses Member and customer information, and how the ESC protects your privacy. It also explains how you can manage your own personal information held in the ESC system through ‘My ESC’ on the ESC Web Site ([www.escardio.org](http://www.escardio.org/))

This policy applies to personal information held about individuals. It does not apply to information the ESC holds about companies and other organisations.

This general policy is in addition to any specific policies concerning specific products 

or services. It may be amended at any time.

### How the ESC collects personal information

The ESC is an association which combines a wide range of activities in the field of cardiology, including:

  * Provision of Membership Services 
  * Collection and dissemination of scientific information 
  * Provision of Products and Services



This may require the handling of personal information of the individuals involved in these activities and hence the ESC collects personal information in a number of ways from a number of sources. This information may be communicated to the ESC on paper forms received through the postal services or by fax, or electronically through registration on the ESC Web Site and use of the ESC’s online services (‘My ESC’).

The sources of personal information received by the ESC are:

  * The individuals themselves 
  * Third parties acting on behalf of individuals (eg an agent arranging registration or hotel accommodation for an ESC organised Congress) 
  * Affiliated Associations providing details of their Members (Note: Members of National Cardiology Societies and Councils for Cardiology Practice are also members of the ESC by virtue of their association’s affiliation to the ESC).



The ways in which the ESC collects personal information are:

  * When you register personal details when creating or updating a ‘My ESC’ account on the ESC Web Site 
  * When you, or an agent on your behalf, enter personal details on a form requesting an ESC product or service (eg when registering for an ESC organised Congress) 
  * When you, or someone on your behalf, submits proposals or content in connection with scientific sessions at an ESC organised Congress or meeting (eg Abstracts submission) 
  * When you enter personal details on a form applying to become a Fellow of the ESC, or Member of one of the ESC constituent bodies (such as ESC Associations and Working Groups) 
  * When an association affiliated to the ESC supplies the ESC with details of their Members’ personal information



### What personal information is collected by the ESC

#### Mandatory Personal Information

As a general rule, to enable the ESC to correctly identify you, to provide you with the products and services you have requested and to communicate with you, the following minimum information must be provided in order for your order, request, application, etc. to be processed:

Title, First Name(s), Family Name(s)  
Full Postal Address

#### Optional Personal Information

Other information may be requested to help identification (eg date of birth), to contact you in case of need (telephone and fax), or to enable the ESC to understand your profile so you can be provided with better and more appropriate products and services (eg Professional Activities and Fields of Interest).

#### Email address information

Your email address must be supplied when you use the ESC electronic services on the web (ie when you use ‘My ESC’ on the ESC Web Site). In other circumstances the email address is optional.

For more information concerning emails, please go to the section Email Addresses.

#### Credit Card Information

Credit Card information, along with other information related to specific transactions, is collected at the time of your order, request or application, and is used only for the purposes of that particular transaction. For your protection, the Credit Card information is not retained in the ESC system for later use for other transactions.

For further information about security, please refer to Data Security.

### How the ESC uses personal information

Personal information is needed by the ESC to enable it to properly manage its Member and customer files. These files are used to enable the ESC to fulfil its role in providing a wide range of services to its Members, contributors and customers.

The personal information which you supply may be specifically used to:

  * Enable the ESC to provide you with the products or services you request 
  * Enable the ESC to communicate with you about specific matters 
  * Enable the ESC to send you information about ESC activities which it believes may interest you



### How long personal information is kept

As a general rule, personal information is kept for three years after your last use of an ESC product or service. If you are an ESC Member, your information will be kept in the ESC system while you continue to be a Member even if you do not use ESC products or services during that time.

### Email addresses

Electronic communication is for most purposes the ESC’s preferred method of communication because it is generally convenient, rapid, effective and efficient. In order to be able to communicate with you directly electronically the ESC needs your email address. You are therefore required to supply your email address when you create your ‘My ESC’ account on the ESC Web Site, which enables you to access a variety of services online.

#### Unique Email Address

For your convenience and security, your email address is unique to you in the system. (The ESC does not permit two different persons to have the same email address in the system). You are strongly recommended to use an email address which is personal to you and that is not shared with others. This is to ensure that communications which are sent to you personally are not read by others, and that others do not gain access to the information in your ‘My ESC’ account.

Additionally, the unique email permits automated retrieval of your login details, which are sent to your personal email address.

#### Email privacy

The ESC respects the privacy of personal email addresses and complies with the current legislation on email communication. The objective is not to send you unwanted messages, and your email details will not be passed on to any other individual or organisation without your explicit permission.

Without your specific ‘Opt In’ to receive emailings from the ESC you may receive emails concerning:

  * Products and services similar to those you have already received from the ESC 
  * If you are a Member of an ESC Association or Working Group (whose benefits to Members include email newsletters, etc), activities or scientific information specifically concerning the Association or Working Group of which you are a Member



You can manage the extent to which the ESC communicates with you by using the e-News section in your ‘My ESC’ homepage. Here you are asked to indicate whether or not you wish to receive ESC generated emails. 

If you decide that you do wish to receive email communications from the ESC you can select which categories of news interest you. All mailings sent to you offer the possibility to unsubscribe.

If you indicate that you do not wish to receive ESC generated emails you will only receive emails directly related to the transactions you have with the ESC (eg confirmations of registrations, etc.) and other necessary individual communications.

### Disclosure of information and Marketing

The ESC complies with EC directives and is registered under the data protection laws in France, and takes all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal data. The ESC staff and contractors have a responsibility to keep your information confidential.

The ESC does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. The ESC may supply your information to its contractors to perform specific services (such as to the publishers to deliver ESC journals). Otherwise, the ESC does not disclose personal information to any other person or organisation without your consent.

If you are a delegate at an ESC organised Congress or meeting, and you visit exhibiting company stands, presenting your badge may enable them to retrieve the following personal data: first name(s), last name(s), address, telephone, fax, email, and professional activity information.

### Right of access to your ESC information

You have the absolute right to access, amend, and oppose the use of, your personal data. 

When you visit ‘My ESC’ you have direct control over the information in your personal profile. Your can access and change this information at any time from your ‘My ESC’ homepage.

If you want to know exactly what personal information the ESC holds on you, you can obtain it. If it transpires that the information is inaccurate, or you wish to oppose its use in future, the ESC will make the necessary amendments and confirm that these have been made. Please contact the ESC in either of the following ways:

  * [Online through ‘Contact Us’ ](http://www.escardio.org/Contact.htm)

### Data security

To protect your information, the ESC uses an industry standard security protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt the transmission of sensitive information between you and our website. 

SSL is used, for example, when you login or when you make a credit card payment. To know if transmissions are encrypted, look for the lock on your web browser or check that the URL starts with https://.

### Use of Cookies 

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record keeping purposes. They are small text files that a website can use to recognise repeat users and facilitate their ongoing access to, and use of, the site. They do not pose a threat to your system or files.

The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many websites use them to provide useful features. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a computer. Most browsers are set initially to accept cookies. You can set your computer to reject cookies. However, if you do choose to disable cookies, you will not be able to use the online services offered through ‘My ESC’.

### External Links

The ESC Web Site contains links to other websites. Please be aware that the ESC is not responsible for the privacy policies of other sites. You are therefore encouraged to read the privacy policies of any other site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by the ESC.  
  


### ‘My ESC’ – Managing your contact with the ESC

#### Access to Personalised Services

You do not need to register to access most of the ESC Web Site, but you do have to register to use personal services online and access certain web content.

The details you supply the ESC may be combined with information from other ESC records to:

  * provide you with online services like Abstract Submission, Registration for Congresses, etc. 
  * save you having to keep giving the same information for different ESC services 
  * allow you to access specific web content reserved for ‘My ESC’ users 
  * help you to get more out of the ESC by keeping you up to date about ESC activities, scientific developments, and products and services by email. (Note: This is an ‘Opt-In’ service only – for more information, please go to the section Email Addresses)



#### Access to your personal information

‘My ESC’ enables you to manage your personal information held by the ESC. If you are a Member of the ESC, or have used ESC products and services in the last three years, a record will already exist for you which you can potentially access by logging in online through:

  * use of your existing login details (username and password), if you have already used the ESC online services (‘My ESC’) during the last three years 
  * the ‘Retrieve your Login’ feature which, if your email address is recognised, will automatically send details of your username and a newly generated password (for your protection) to the email address given 
  * using special alternative login functionality available for limited periods for Congress delegates, which uses information on the Congress badges 
  * requesting your login details to be sent to you [through ‘Contact Us’](http://www.escardio.org/Contact.htm)



Alternatively, you can simply create a new ‘My ESC’ account by using ‘Join Now’ in ‘My ESC’ when asked for login information. The ESC does not permit more than one ‘My ESC’ account per person to avoid confusion. So, if an account already exists for you in the ESC system, your new account will be matched to it (normally within two working days, but longer during the ESC organised Congress period for technical reasons). 

When matched, Membership and other information regarding products and services used (eg Journal subscriptions) will be transferred to your new account, and previous personal details held in the ESC system will be replaced by the new ones you entered.

#### Managing your personal information

Once logged in to your ‘My ESC’ account, you can easily view and update your personal details, email address, username and password. 

Additionally, you can manage whether or not you wish to be kept informed by email of ESC activities, products and services by using the e-News section. The ESC also asks you to provide optional information about your professional activities and interests in order to understand your needs better, and improve the services it offers to you and to the cardiology community in general.
