There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by eSchoolData. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by eSchoolData for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the eSchoolData Web site.

Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through eSchoolData public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: eSchoolData does not read any of your private online communications.

eSchoolData encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from eSchoolData so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. eSchoolData is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the eSchoolData and eSchoolData family of Web sites.

**Use of your Personal Information  
**eSchoolData collects and uses your personal information to operate the eSchoolData Web site and deliver the services you have requested. eSchoolData also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from eSchoolData and its affiliates. eSchoolData may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

eSchoolData does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. eSchoolData may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, eSchoolData may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to eSchoolData, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

**Use of Cookies  
**The eSchoolData Web site use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize eSchoolData pages, or register with eSchoolData site or services, a cookie helps eSchoolData to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same eSchoolData Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the eSchoolData features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the eSchoolData services or Web sites you visit.

**Security of your Personal Information  
**eSchoolData secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. eSchoolData secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

**Changes to this Statement  
**eSchoolData will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. eSchoolData encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how eSchoolData is protecting your information.

**Contact Information  
**eSchoolData welcomes your comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. If you believe that eSchoolData has not adhered to this Statement, please contact eSchoolData at [webmaster@eschooldata.com](mailto:webmaster@eschooldata.com). We will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and remedy the problem.

## Product Use

### **FERPA Compliance, Data Security and Privacy Policy**

**Background**  
eSchoolData has developed proprietary software products which are licensed to local educational agencies, (LEAs), Regional Information Centers (RICs) and Intermediate Units (IUs).

**Data Ownership and Rights**  
eSchoolData has access to personally identifiable data (PII) for the sole purpose of supporting its product offerings consistent with Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations, 34 CFR §99.31(a)(1)(i)(B). eSchoolData acknowledges that it does not own any of the student-related data entered into its products. Data entered into its products remain the property of the licensee. eSchoolData is committed to protection of privacy and security of student, teacher, and principal data, in accordance with FERPA and New York Education Law § 2-d.

**Non-commercial Use**  
eSchoolData does not collect, maintain, use or share personally identifiable information (PII) for any purpose other than to support its licensed product offering. eSchoolData does not sell or otherwise use PII data for commercial purposes.

**ESD Non-Disclosure Agreements**  
All employees and contractors of eSchoolData are required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement which includes eSchoolData’s FERPA compliance, Data Privacy and Security Policy. Disclosure of protected data is strictly prohibited beyond the term of employment.

**Court Ordered and other Requests for Data**  
In the event eSchoolData is contacted directly by any third party (including the eligible student or parent/guardian of the eligible student) seeking access to education records, eSchoolData will immediately inform the Licensee of such request. eSchoolData shall not provide access to such data or information or respond to such requests unless compelled to do so by court order or lawfully issued subpoena from any court of competent jurisdiction or directed to do so by the Licensee. Should eSchoolData receive a court order or lawfully issued subpoena seeking the release of such data or information, eSchoolData shall provide immediate notification, along with a copy thereof, to the Licensee prior to releasing the requested data or information, unless such notification is prohibited by law or judicial and/or administrative order or subpoena.

**Data Breach  
**In the event eSchoolData becomes aware of a data breach or inadvertent disclosure of PII, eSchoolData shall take immediate steps to limit and mitigate such security breach to the extent possible. eSchoolData will notify the Licensee, typically within 24 hours of confirmation of the event. eSchoolData will work cooperatively with the licensee in determining an action plan, including any required notification of affected persons.

**Disposal and Destruction of Data upon Contract Termination**  
Upon contract termination, licensee is responsible for determining the extent to which destruction of eSchoolData archive databases is desired. Due to the nature of the eSchoolData system and licensee’s responsibility to ensure access to historical records, licensee needs adequate time to ensure that migration to a new software system is complete, including historical records. With this in mind, eSchoolData will not automatically dispose of historical databases upon contract termination. Once directed by licensee to return and/or destroy archive databases, eSchoolData shall provide written acknowledgement including the industry-standard destruction method, scope and date(s) of destruction/disposal.

**Data Correction**  
eSchoolData users (Districts/Schools/Agencies) are responsible for developing policies which allow parents/students to request correction(s) to data which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. eSchoolData products provide a permission structure which allows authorized users to make changes in accordance with local policies.

**Delivery Models**  
eSchoolData products use a centralized, Software as a Service (SaaS) delivery model. eSchoolData product offerings are either hosted in a data center located within an eSchoolData facility, or in a data center managed by a Regional Information Center (RICs) and/or an Intermediate Unit (IUs), collectively referred to as Hosting Partners. The data center controls described in this policy document relate to data centers located in eSchoolData facilities.

It is the responsibility of each Hosting Partner to develop a Data Security and Privacy Policy conforming to Federal requirements and respective state governing laws. Enforcement of Hosting Partners’ Data Security and Privacy policies is the sole responsibility of the Hosting Partner.

**eSchoolData Application Layer Security (Access Levels and Password Management)**  
The eSchoolData system automatically disables access if incorrect user name and passwords are repeatedly entered or whenever malicious activity is suspected. Once disabled, users cannot login to eSchoolData systems until the licensee’s system administrator re-enables the account. (Licensees are responsible for assigning System Administrators. System Administrators are responsible for determining the appropriate data access levels for their respective user base.)

The eSchoolData System allows system administrators to disable accounts and/or force password changes on-demand or on a scheduled basis (example: every 90 days, every 120 days, etc.). Additionally, system administrators can force password changes, disable accounts, and monitor activity from a central point. (Licensee’s System Administrators are responsible for managing user accounts and for enforcing password change policies.)

**eSchoolData Data Center – Infrastructure Security**  
eSchoolData employs extensive technological and operational measures to ensure data security. The eSchoolData infrastructure is designed in accordance with industry design standards. Web Servers facing the Internet use SSL Certificates for Authentication and 128-bit Encryption, and are protected from the Internet behind redundant firewalls. The database and document servers are isolated behind another pair of redundant firewalls.

**eSchoolData Data Center Physical Security**  
eSchoolData offices are monitored by a Central Station on a 24/7 basis and are equipped with a video surveillance system. Building access is controlled via key code, and a secondary code is required to access the Data Center.

**eSchoolData Data Center Environmental Controls**  
eSchoolData’s data center is equipped to provide power via dual independent power systems. The UPS can power the entire data center on full load for up to one hour. Each rack has dual power entry points so if one power strip fails, the other will take over. The facility is newly equipped with a Natural Gas Powered Generator that is capable of keeping the entire data center up indefinitely. A Natural Gas option was chosen over Diesel to ensure uninterrupted service even in the coldest months when diesel fuel has a tendency to gel.

_**eSchoolData may update this policy from time to time to remain in compliance with Federal and State laws and regulations.**_
