# 511.org

MTC/511 respects your privacy and recognizes your desire for appropriate protection of any Personal Information you share with us. MTC/511 has established this Privacy Notice so that you can understand the care with which we treat your Personal Information.

##  **Information Gathered**

Personal Information means individually identifiable information, such as a first and last name, a home or other physical address, phone number, or an e-mail address or other contact information, whether at work or at home.   
We assure you that we do not:

  * Collect Personal Information except when you permit it; or
  * Sell, rent, or otherwise provide any Personal Information to third parties for commercial use.



We do:

  * Use voluntarily provided Personal Information for the benefit of the 511 program and the user experience, as described in this Privacy Policy;
  * Forward e-mails and phone messages that ask questions or provide comments on services provided by rideshare programs, transit agencies, Caltrans, and other public agencies for their response;
  * Use standard web and phone technologies to generate aggregate usage statistics in order to improve the user experience and system performance; and
  * Use third-party contractors to operate our 511 services, who will have access to Personal Information solely for the benefit of the program and will be required to comply with privacy policies as provided in this Notice.



## **511 Programs**

Various 511 programs may collect and use Personal Information. The treatment of Personal Information in each of these types of programs is described in the three sections that follow.

**_511 Driving Times SM_**  
In the 511 Driving TimesSM service, MTC/511 operates a data collection system based on FasTrak® toll tags to provide better information about the transportation network to Bay Area travelers, transportation managers, and transportation planners.

In matters concerning traffic data collection, MTC/511 will take the following steps to ensure the protection of personal information:

  * The tag users' consent will be secured via a FasTrak® toll tag license agreement before the operation of any data collection system based on toll tags.

  * Encryption oftware in the central software system will mask each tag ID before any other processing is done to ensure that the toll tags are treated anonymously.

  * The encrypted tag IDs will be retained for no longer than twenty-four hours and then discarded. No historical database of the encrypted IDs will be maintained beyond that time period.

  * Every two years, or the year following any major change in the 511 Driving Times system (whichever occurs first), a comprehensive assessment of privacy protection will be performed.




**_511 Phone Services_  
**The 511 phone system records your phone number, the date, time and duration of your call, and what you asked the system. The call information is used to compile anonymous data to improve 511 services.  In addition, when callers select such functions as making comments or suggestions or voluntary participation in phone surveys, troubleshooting, contests and special promotions, they choose to provide additional Personal Information.  Calls asking about agency-specific services may be transferred to those agencies, at which point the privacy policy of the receiving agency applies to the call and any Personal Information provided or collected. 

**_511.org Web Services_**  
MTC/511 operate several web-based 511.org programs that may collect Personal Information.

  * **511 Rideshare RideMatch, 511 SchoolPool, and Bike Buddy RideMatch Services**  
In order to use the 511 Rideshare RideMatch Service, 511 SchoolPool, and Bike Buddy RideMatch service, you must first complete the online registration form. In the process of that registration, 511.org collects Personal Information such as first and last name, e-mail address, home and work address, school name, and home and work telephone numbers; and we disclose and publish your first and last name, e-mail, employer or school name, and the telephone number that you choose to share with other participants in the particular program for use as part of the services. We also publish the relative geographic locations of participants in the particular program to the other participants, such as by showing dots on a map that may show the general neighborhood or location (though not specific home or work addresses). MTC/511 will share Personal Information with (1) other government-funded rideshare agencies or (2) the employer or school administrator who is coordinating the program at the worksite or school or (3) MTC's third-party rideshare contractor for ridesharing purposes only. Personal Information will only be used to (1) facilitate ridematches, (2) provide you with coordinated information about products, services and special campaigns that encourage the use of alternatives to driving alone and (3) follow-up with registrants to research the number of successful carpools/vanpools/bike buddies established. In addition, you may receive e-mail messages from the 511 Rideshare RideMatch Service program administrators requesting you to review and update your Personal Information or phone calls to provide follow-up assistance. 511 Rideshare can provide you with a list of those with access to your personal information upon request, by submitting a request via the [511.org Suggestion form](https://web.archive.org/web/20110518155703id_/http%3A//www.511.org/suggestions/global_suggestions.asp).
  * **  
MY 511**  
In order to use the MY 511 service, you must first complete the online registration form on the 511.org website and create a user name and password; and in that process, we collect Personal Information such as first and last name and e-mail address. At your option, we may also collect Personal Information such as cell/landline phone numbers or other information to send messages to your e-mail address, cell phone, handheld device, or other mobile device. The MY 511 phone service will use registrants' phone numbers, saved during user set-up, to recognize them when calling 511.  We do not publish or disclose this Personal Information to third parties, with the exception of our MTC/511 contractors who have agreed to comply with this privacy policy.  We also save registrants' trip profiles (traffic and/or transit) to allow for prompt receipt of traveler information when accessing 511 on the phone and/or web. In addition, you may receive e-mail messages from the MY 511 program administrators requesting you to review and update your Personal Information or phone calls to provide follow-up assistance.
  * **  
Other 511.org Online Programs**  
From time to time, 511.org may sponsor online customer surveys, contests or other promotional programs, such as Friends of 511, Bike to Work Day, Team Bike Challenge, and Rideshare Rewards; and we may request Personal Information when you register for these online contests or other promotional programs offered by 511.org. This Personal Information may include your name, e-mail address, phone number, and address. As part of these promotions, we may also provide you with program updates, newsletters, and special offers. Personal Information is collected as part of online surveys only if it is voluntarily provided.



Of course, you do not need to provide the Personal Information requested as part of these 511.org web-based programs or services, though you may not be able to use some or all of the features of certain programs or services without providing the information.  The 511.org website and the services provided through it are directed only to adults and children who are age 13 and older; MTC/511 do not knowingly collect information about any person or user who is under 13.

To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, MTC/511 wish to maintain accurate Personal Information. Where we collect Personal Information from you on the web, our goal is to provide a means of contacting MTC/511 should you need to update or correct that Information or withdraw from a 511 program. You will be provided with account access to update your Personal Information through a user name and password selected by you. If for any reason you are unable to access your account, you can notify us via the comment form on the 511.org website.
