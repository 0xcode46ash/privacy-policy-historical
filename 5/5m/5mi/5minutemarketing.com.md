# 5Minute Marketing Privacy page

We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used. We promise that we will take steps to use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy. The following policies are only in effect for the Web pages, newsletters, discussion lists and opt-in mailing lists owned and operated by 5minutemarketing.com.  

The following discloses our Privacy Policy:

**What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?**  
Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the 5minutemarketing.com Network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals.

**What are cookies?**  
From time to time, 5minutemarketing.com may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to identify which areas of 5minutemarketing.com's Network of Web sites you have visited or customized, so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily accessible.

You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our site and other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.

**Do you use single-pixel gifs?**  
5minutemarketing.com **does not** use single-pixel gif images, sometimes referred to as web bugs or web beacons, to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical information.

**What other information do you request?**  
We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists or information). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. 

When you sign up for a 5minutemarketing.com forum, your name or alias is recorded solely for purposes of maintaining your own account within the forums. This information is not used to monitor your activity within a forum, nor is it used to identify you outside of 5minutemarketing.com in any way.

When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

**eMail Solicitations and Opt-Out Policy**  
5minutemarketing.com sends to existing and potential subscribers email solicitations from lists compiled from opt-in requests, existing customer contact information, contact information publicly provided on a company's web site, lists from partners, purchased from list brokers or special lists provided by event vendors. All email solicitations, in accordance with U.S. Federal law, provide both a clear email address of the sender and simple, clear instructions of how to remove your name from all future mailings. All "remove" requests are processed with best efforts prior to additional mailings in order to honor your request. "Remove" requests are tracked by the request date in a Customer Relationship Management system to make all reasonable effort to avoid mailings after the removal request date. Remove requests can be communicated to our company via phone to the phone number of our headquarters office, by letter mailed to our headquarters address or via email to [info@5minutemarketing.com.com](mailto:info@casecentral.com).

**What else should I know about my privacy when online?**  
The 5minutemarketing.com web site may contains many links to other Web sites. 5minutemarketing.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 5minutemarketing.com does not share any of the individual personal information you provide 5minutemarketing.com with the sites to which 5minutemarketing.com links,.

**Please check with those sites to determine their privacy policy.**  
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example through e-mail, discussion lists, or elsewhere - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.

**Your Consent To This Agreement**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
