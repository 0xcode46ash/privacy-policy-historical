### Privacy Policy

The following is a statement of Moody Bible Institute’s (MBI) general policies for the use of visitor information collected through our websites. Some areas may have specific policies regarding the privacy of user-provided information and may contain exceptions to this statement. Consult the statement posted under that area’s Web page for the appropriate information.

### Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

### The Information We Collect

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on Moody Bible Institute’s website, unless otherwise posted. On some pages, you may order products, register for conferences, make requests and register/subscribe to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

• Name  
• Address  
• E-mail address  
• Phone number  
• Credit/debit card information  
• Radio station call letters

On some pages you may submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift subscription and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient’s address. In this case, the types of personal information collected are:

• Name  
• Relation (if any)  
• Address  
• Phone number  
• E-mail address

Additionally, we collect certain information in our server log files, whether or not you send us a request to help us maintain and improve the performance of our web servers. This information includes the IP address, type of browser, the page you were referred from, the page you are visiting and the time of the visit. We also collect the same information when you receive an error page. No personal information is contained in these logs. We do use statistical software to analyze our logs to obtain aggregate values on how many times a page is viewed, total number of visitors by country, browser popularity and other similar totals.

When you visit any Moody Bible Institute website, we send one or more cookies—a small file containing a string of characters—to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as how people search. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Moody Bible Institute website features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

### Kids and Teens

Please be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself to us or anyone else online or over the Internet. If you are under the age of 13, you must obtain permission from your parents. They simply need to send us an e-mail indicating their approval of your participation in any of the services/resources which require the collection of personal information on our website.

### Parents

Any information collected by Moody Bible Institute from children/teens is used only for the purpose of delivering the requested service/materials. If you have a question, or would like to review or delete your child’s information, please contact us via e-mail to the Web Administrator at [webadmin@moody.edu](mailto:webadmin@moody.edu "Web Administrator e-mail") or write to us at:

### **The Way We Use Information**

We use the information you provide about yourself when using an online form only to complete that contact. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete/resolve that contact (i.e., verifying credit authorization or sending a package through a postal/delivery system).

We use the information you provide about someone else when placing a request only to mail the materials and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that request.

We offer gift subscriptions or co-registrations by which you can request a service or item for another person. Information you provide to us to create an alternate user is used only for that purpose, and it is disclosed only to the person receiving the service/item.

We use return e-mail addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. If you subscribe to an e-mail newsletter or request to be kept on a list for notification of events or information from Moody, such addresses are used for those purposes and are not shared with outside parties.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online or offline in ways unrelated to the ones described above. We do not sell, trade, or share our donor list with any other organization. If you have subscribed to an email newsletter you may log in to change the settings. If you have problems logging in or are having problems getting off a list, please contact the web administrator at [webadmin@moody.edu](mailto:webadmin@moody.edu "Web Administrator e-mail").

### Our Commitment to Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

### How You Can Correct Your Information

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request via e-mail or postal mail that credibly shows error.
