Your payment information will not be stored on our website.   We do not currently offer any on-site direct payment gateway options to complete your purchase, but if we did, then 50 states Classifieds would store your credit card data.

After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.   All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.   PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.   For more insight, you may also want to read the 2checkout.com and PayPal.com Terms of Service available on their websites.

  In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.   However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.   For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.   In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.   As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.   Once you leave our storeâ€™s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our websiteâ€™s Terms of Service.
