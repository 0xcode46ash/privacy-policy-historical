When you join our online community ("The Back Fence"), we ask for basic contact information (like your name and e-mail address) and demographic information (like your age, province and retirement status). We use your e-mail address to contact you when necessary. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We share demographic and profile information with advertisers on an aggregate basis (ie. 25% of our visitors are from Alberta and have visited 100 times in the last month). We do not share personal information with other members or any other third parties without your written permission. You can cancel your membership by e-mailing [info@50plus.com](mailto:info@50plus.com?subject=cancel%20BF%20membership)

Our site uses order forms for you to request products and services (ie. CARP memberships). We collect your contact information (like your e-mail address) and financial information (like your credit card number) in order to process your order. 

**Surveys**  
Our online surveys ask you for demographic information (like your age, sex, province or income level). This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.
