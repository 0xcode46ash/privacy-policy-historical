### What personal information does 50plus.com collect and why?

**Community**  
When you join our online community, we ask for basic contact information (like your name and e-mail address) and demographic information (like your age, province and postal code). We use your e-mail address to contact you when necessary. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We share demographic and profile information with advertisers on an aggregate basis (ie. 25% of our visitors are from Alberta and have visited 100 times in the last month). We do not share personal information with other members or any other third parties without your written permission. You can cancel your membership by e-mailing  **[support@50plus.com](mailto:support@50plus.com?subject=cancel%20BF%20membership)**

**Order forms**  
Our site uses order forms for you to request products and services (ie. CARP memberships). We collect your contact information (like your e-mail address) and financial information (like your credit card number) in order to process your order.

**Surveys**  
Our online surveys may ask you for demographic information (like your age, sex, province or income level). This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. Again – no individual information is ever released.

**Contests**  
We sometimes run contests on our site in partnership with other companies. Please see each contest’s privacy statement.

**Our E-mail lists**  
This site makes e-mail list sign-up available to its users. We do not subscribe people to these lists without their consent or sell the e-mail addresses gathered on these lists. We strongly believe that you should easily be able to unsubscribe from our newsletters if you no longer wish to receive them.

We collect non-personal identification information through the use of “cookie” technology and/or IP address tracking. Non-personal identification information might include the browser you use, the type of computer, the operating systems, the Internet service providers and other similar information.
