# Privacy Policy and Cookies | 50 Games Like

This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about the practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information that may be collected by 50 Games Like and the Group Companies (which mean the Joint Users of Personal Information as defined in Section 4(1) and together with 50 Games Like, hereinafter referred to as “50GamesLike”). Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use (the “Terms”), available here, before using or submitting information to the websites owned or operated by 50GamesLike (collectively, the “Sites”)*. 

**1\. Consent**  
By using the Sites, you agree to the Terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via the Sites, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

**2\. Information Collected**

Information Collected Automatically  
50GamesLike also automatically collects your IP address and referring website address, browser type, domain name and website access frequency. This information is intended to help facilitate your online experience on the Sites. 50GamesLike uses cookies to track usage patterns on the Sites and to control the display of ads, as well as to offer other functionalities (such as screening for age and “recognizing” you to speed up your log-in when you visit the Sites). You can turn off cookies, but that will affect your online experience. See below for more detail on cookies.

**3\. Purposes of Use of Collected Information**  
50GamesLike uses information other than Personal Information you provide for the purpose of fulfillment of your requests and improvement of the Sites and materials contained thereon and for any other purposes which we deem reasonable and necessary. 50GamesLike may, from time to time, produce reports for advertisers, sponsors, Group Companies and vendors containing anonymous, aggregate information about our users and customers, such as demographic, age and online usage information. This information allows 50GamesLike to provide content and offers that are most relevant to our users to work more closely with advertisers. We do not include any Personal Information of our users in these reports.

**4\. Sharing of Collected Information**

Sharing of Information Not Containing Personal Information  
50GamesLike shares anonymous, aggregate demographic information, and anonymous information obtained from cookies and similar technologies, with each of our distributors, our sponsors, promotional and business partners, and participating vendors. No Personal Information, such as credit card information, is disclosed to any of these third parties in sharing such anonymous information. 

**5\. Disclosure to Third Parties**  
50GamesLike will not disclose your Personal Information to any third parties without your consent; provided, however, that 50GamesLike reserves the right to use or disclose to a third party any information without a customer’s consent in the following circumstances: (i) if it is requested by any laws and regulations; (ii) If 50GamesLike deems it necessary for protection and security of human life, body or assets (including the Sites); (iii) if 50GamesLike deems it particularly necessary for improvement of public health or enrichment of children’s welfare; (iv) if 50GamesLike deems it particularly necessary for cooperation with a governmental body or other public organization or its designee in discharging its duties pursuant to the laws and regulations (including investigating breach of laws), or otherwise deems it particularly necessary for the public interest; (v) if 50GamesLike outsources the handling of personal information to the extent necessary for its business operation.

**6\. Cookies**  
Your web browser offers so-called “cookies” which, if you allow their use, store small amounts of data on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies do not contain any Personal Information about you and therefore cannot be used to identify you personally. However, cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best. Therefore, cookies enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your browser settings. Our Sites are viewable even if you disable the cookie function on your browser. However, if you disable cookies, some advanced and customized features will not be available to you. 

**7\. Web Beacons**  
Some of our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons, which are also called “single-pixel gifs”. These images allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We may also include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon. Web beacons are not used to access your Personal Information but they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about usage on the Sites. Web beacons collect only a limited range of information including the time and date of page view, cookie number and description of the page on which the web beacon resides. 

**8\. Security of Personal Information**  
We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt important information, such as your credit card data, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access during transmission of your orders over the Internet. We implement standard industry practices internally and with our service providers to maintain the security of your Personal Information depending on its sensitivity and to avoid disclosure of such Personal Information unpermitted under this Privacy Policy. 

Although we have implemented systems and procedures to secure the data maintained by us, security during Internet transmissions can never be assured. 50GamesLike employees are made aware of our privacy practices through periodic communications and training. Our policy is to limit access to Personal Information to those 50GamesLike employees or agents with a specific need to access or retrieve the information. We store data on multiple service systems, in controlled environments. To maintain security, we conduct internal reviews of our security measures on a regular basis. Please note, however, that any Personal Information you post in chat rooms or message boards is available to anyone. WHILE 50GamesLike HAS TAKEN COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS TO SAFEGUARD PERSONAL INFORMATION, 50GamesLike CANNOT AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLETE SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BECAUSE COMPLETE SECURITY DOES NOT PRESENTLY EXIST ON THE INTERNET.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

**9\. Transfer of personal Information**  
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for 50GamesLike or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. 50GamesLike will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

**10\. Third Party Advertising**  
Advertisements appearing on our Sites may be delivered to users by us or one of our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by 50GamesLike only, and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**11\. Children**  
We will not knowingly collect Personal Information via the Sites from visitors younger than thirteen (13) years of age. We encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose on websites. 

**12\. Changes in Corporate Structure**  
In developing our business, we may engage in the sale or transfer of certain assets and the company itself, or parts of it, may be sold, merged or otherwise assigned. In such transactions and changes in ownership, user information, whether personally identifiable or otherwise, may constitute one of the transferred assets. If required by law, we will notify affected users of such transfer or assignment in accordance with the procedure for changing this Privacy Policy described below.

  
**13\. Changes to our Privacy Policy**  
We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy as necessary to protect our users and to accommodate a changing environment. The changes to our Privacy Policy will be deemed to be effective from the date of posting on our Sites unless we specify otherwise. We recommend that you check the Privacy Policy when you visit our Sites to be sure that you are aware of and understand our current policy. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will make efforts to prominently post such changes prior to implementing the change. We will not make any retroactive material changes in how we handle previously collected Personal Information unless you allow us to do so, or unless we are legally required to do so, and in such a case we will make efforts to inform registered visitors of information on material changes to this Privacy Policy via email.

Please contact us if you have any questions, comments or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy, our privacy practices or our treatment of your Personal Information.
