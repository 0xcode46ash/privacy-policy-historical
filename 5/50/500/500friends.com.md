# 500Friends - Privacy Statement

**Summary**

By logging in directly to your social network, neither your username nor password is ever transmitted to us. This means that even in the unlikely event that we get “hacked,” your information will not be compromised. 

We will never post/tweet anything without your explicit permission. 

500Friends is committed to respecting your privacy and security of your personal information. You are very important to us and we want to provide you with a safe and secure online experience. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use your information and gives you choices as to how we use it. The Privacy Policy applies to "www.500Friends.com" (collectively, "the sites") operated by 500Friends, Inc. By using the sites and providing your contact information, you consent to our privacy policy. We suggest that you review this Privacy Policy periodically as we will update and change it from time to time. This policy was last updated November 2009.

We may track your visit for trends and statistics, but you will remain anonymous unless you tell us who you are. Once you choose to give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. 

We do not collect or save your social network log-in credentials.

**How do you share my information?**

On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by law, to enforce our website policies, or to protect our or others' rights, property, or safety. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes. 

We will not sell, trade, or rent personally identifiable information to other companies as part of our regular course of business. However, it's possible that we might acquire or merge with or be acquired by another company or that we might dispose of some or all of our assets. If that happens, your personal information may be disclosed to another company, but that disclosure will be subject to the Privacy Policy in effect. 

**How do I know my information is secure?**

We have a variety of security measures to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you. To ensure the information you provide online is secure during transmission, we use leading edge encryption technology and Secure Socket Layers (SSL) while processing any personal information you supply. 

This site is also tested and certified daily to pass the McAfee Secure Security Scan. To help address concerns about hacker access to confidential data, the "live" McAfee Hacker Safe Secure mark appears only when a web site meets the McAfee Secure standard. Research indicates sites remotely scanned for known vulnerabilities on a daily basis, such as those earning McAfee Secure certification, can prevent over 99% of hacker crime. 

**What if I have more questions about the privacy policy?**
