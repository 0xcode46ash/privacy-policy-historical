## Privacy Policy

####  At FIZ Karlsruhe – Leibniz-Institut für Informationsinfrastruktur GmbH (hereinafter referred to as “FIZ Karlsruhe”, “we” or “us” ) ensuring the security and protection of your personal data is a primary concern. We would therefore like to inform you on how, to what extent, and for which purposes we collect, process and use your personal data. 

### What we do:

FIZ Karlsruhe offers you web pages for information purposes and online products (hereinafter summarized as our “digital offers”). We process personal data collected from the visitors of our digital offers exclusively in compliance with data protection laws. The legal basis of data protection can be found in the General Data Protection Regulation (Datenschutz-Grundverordnung (DSGVO)), the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG)) in its valid form and the Telemedia Act (Telemediengesetz (TMG)). 

The sections below will inform you about the type and scope of data we collect, the reasons why we collect them, and the way in which they are used and processed. We use these data only for specified purposes. 

In general, you may use our web pages without providing any additional personal information. 

If you would like to use our online products, you will need a user account (individual access) for which we will collect personal data from you. In addition, different rules may apply about which you will be informed separately in the respective Terms and Conditions. 

### I. What do we know about your use of our digital offers?

#### 1\. Log Files

By default, our server will store the following user information in a log file whenever our digital offers are used: 

  * IP addresses used
  * If you have logged in: your user ID and allocation to your institution (if any)
  * Operating system used
  * Browser used
  * Pages visited
  * Search query and number of hits
  * Preferences
  * Date and time of access
  * Volume of data sent and received (bytes)
  * Address of the web page from which our page was accessed (referrer)



We use the log file data 

  1. to trace our customers’ movements through our digital offers in case of malfunctions in order to identify the malfunction, 
  2. to trace our visitors’ actions if there is specific indication that our digital offers have been used in an illegal manner, and 
  3. to generate usage statistics according to library standards for customers in accordance with the relevant laws and based on separate terms and conditions or terms of use. 



The legal basis for the usage modalities mentioned above is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. 

We will delete the log files and the information contained therein after 13 months at the latest. This does not apply in cases where there is specific indication that our digital offers were used in an illegal manner. In this case the data will be stored until the matter is settled. 

####  2\. Collection and analysis of user data for statistical purposes 

We also use the above mentioned log files to statistically analyze our visitors’ user behavior. From these files we generate usage statistics for customers according to library standards in accordance with the relevant laws and based on separate terms and conditions or terms of use. 

We do not identify the place from which you access our digital offers (geolocalization). 

#### 3\. Cookies

Cookies are text files that we store on your computer. They enable us to monitor when and how you use our digital offers over a defined period of time. We use cookies for various purposes that are described below. 

If you do not want any cookies to be stored on your computer, you must disable this function according to the instructions provided in your web browser. As a consequence, however, you will no longer be able to use certain features of our website (e.g., auto-saving of facets or language settings). 

##### 3.1 Cookies storing settings and preferences

We use cookies to store your settings, e.g., your preferred language. We also use cookies to authenticate subscribed users. A pop-up message within our digital offer will notify you that we are using cookies. If you accept this, we will store this information in a cookie on your computer. Usually, the lifetime of such cookies ranges from some months to more than one year. 

##### 3.2 Cookies required for technical reasons in order to allow for sessions

We use cookies for technical reasons to be able to unambiguously allocate the large number of simultaneous visits to the respective users. They enable us to create “sessions” during which you can perform actions built upon one another. These cookies are automatically deleted at the end of a session (by logout or by closing the tab or the browser used to access our digital offer). 

#### 4\. Sharing content through social networks

We do not use any mechanisms that automatically transmit data to providers of social networks when our digital offers are visited. Some of our digital offers allow for the sharing of pages through social networks. To be able to share a page, you have to activate the button of the social network by mouse click first. Only upon your activating the button the provider of the social network will learn that you are using our digital offer. You have to carry out this activating process for each individual page of our digital offer you would like to share.
