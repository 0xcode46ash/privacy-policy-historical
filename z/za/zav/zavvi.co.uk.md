At zavvi online (Guernsey) limited ("ZOG"), we respect your right to privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information that we ask you to supply to us. We will use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a better shopping experience. 

We and our associated companies may use your personal information to inform you about the latest changes to the site and products or services that you may find of interest but if you prefer not to receive this you can tell us either by sending an e-mail message to [customerservices@zavvi.co.uk](mailto:customerservices@zavvi.co.uk) or by visiting your account details and changing your communication options. [_Click here_](https://web.archive.org/web/20090227151940id_/http%3A//www.zavvi.co.uk/privacy/customeraccountsummary.jsf) to go to your account.

## What information do we ask for?

We will only collect personally identifiable information to the extent reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and we will maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of that personal information.

## How do we use the information?

When you place an order, we need to know your name, e-mail address and delivery address.

Your credit or debit card details will be obtained when you enter your card details to make your order. These are held on a secure server by DataCash who will be responsible for debiting the correct amount from your card. This allows your order to be processed and fulfilled and permits us to track your order status. We also ask for your telephone number, which enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your order.

When you enter a competition or other promotional feature, we will ask for your name, address and e-mail address so we can administer the competition and notify winners. We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site. We may use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can consistently improve our site to better meet our visitors’ needs. To enforce legal rights and the law, we may also disclose information to law enforcement agencies.

The information that you provide may be transferred outside of the EEA (European Economic Area) to companies in the Virgin group for the purposes of processing any orders.

When you place an order or access your account information, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, as required by the UK Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998 and relevant Guernsey data protection legislation, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given to us, to prevent unauthorised access.  
  


## Will ZOG disclose the information it collects to outside parties?

ZOG does not supply your personal information to third parties.

ZOG may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.

From time to time ZOG may employ third parties who may collect personal information on ZOG’s behalf. In such cases, such third parties will be instructed by ZOG to comply with the ZOG Privacy Policy as set forth herein.

## Review, correction or deletion of information from our records

If for any reason you are concerned that the personal information maintained by ZOG is not correct, or it changes or if you no longer desire our service we will endeavour to provide a way to correct, update or remove the data you have provided us with. This can usually be done by contacting our [**Customer Services**](https://web.archive.org/web/20090227151940id_/http%3A//www.zavvi.co.uk/help2/i.jsf) team.
