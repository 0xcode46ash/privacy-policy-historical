# Zacks Privacy Policy - Zacks Investment Research

**Zacks Privacy Policy And Terms Of Service**

Welcome to Zacks.com.  Zacks Investment Research and/or its affiliates provide Zacks.com to you subject to the following Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.  By clicking the “I Accept” button or check box presented with this Privacy Policy and Terms of Service or, if earlier, when you use or submit personal information through Zacks.com or any website affiliated with Zacks.com or Zacks Investment Research and its affiliates, you accept this Privacy Policy and Terms of Service and your use of such sites is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.  If you are accepting this Privacy Policy and Terms of Service for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have the legal authority to bind that entity.   

**Zacks Investment Research Privacy Policy**

Since our inception in 1978, we have sought to have long-term relationships with our customers. Thus, we do not wish to profit from the unwanted distribution of your private information or to inundate you with unnecessary e-mails or other material. The information you may choose to provide includes any or all of the following: email address, name, postal address, and phone number. In fact, we only disclose the information you provide us or send you information if you authorize us to do so by choosing to receive e-mail services on our Zacks.com Web site or opting into third party mailings. We use the information you provide us in the following ways:

**Zacks Investment Research Internal List**

Everyone who submits personal information to Zacks Investment Research online will receive, via e-mail, our free weekly newsletters: Profit from the Pros. Through Profit from the Pros, we provide original and exclusive content from Zacks Investment Research and Zacks.com. We also distribute commentary and investment ideas from independent third parties, who produce financial news publications and who compensate Zacks Investment Research for distributing their newsletters. From time-to-time, we will also send or contact you regarding special offers for products and services from Zacks Investment Research and our affiliates. You can unsubscribe from these e-mails at any time by going to <https://register.zacks.com/unisub.php>.

**Zacks Investment Research Opt-In Marketing List**

During the Zacks.com registration process, we include the contact information you provide us on the Zacks Investment Research opt-in marketing list. We "rent" our opt-in marketing list to outside marketers who have special offers that may be of interest to you. Please note that we "rent" our marketing list, but we do not sell your information to third parties. Zacks Investment Research controls the process through an agreement with an e-mail service provider, which handles the distribution of e-mails from Zacks Investment Research and its business partners. We keep tight control over our marketing list at all times. We only give outside marketers the right to send you an e-mail through our e-mail service provider. Additionally, Zacks Investment Research is selective about which companies we permit to send you an offer. Zacks will use names for Market Research. Our goal is for the e-mails to be of value to you. As always, you can unsubscribe from these e-mails at any time by going to <https://register.zacks.com/unisub.php>.

**Zacks Investment Research Postal and Telemarketing Lists**

Everyone who submits personal postal and phone number information to Zacks Investment Research online may receive special direct mail and telemarketing offers from outside marketers that may be of interest to you. As with our other lists, we "rent" our postal and phone marketing lists and do not sell your information to third parties. Zacks Investment Research controls the process through an agreement with a postal list service bureau and phone call centers, which handles the distribution of direct mail and telemarketing offers from Zacks Investment Research and its business partners. Outside marketers are only given the right to send you a piece of direct mail through our bureau or call you through a telemarketing firm with our approval. All phone numbers on the Zacks telemarketing list are processed through the National Do Not Call Directory to remove anyone registered there. Zacks Investment Research is selective about the companies we permit to send your offers and the offers being sent. Naturally, you can unsubscribe from these direct marketing offers at any time by calling us at 1-800-767-3771 ext. 9339 or emailing your request to [support@zacks.com](mailto:support@zacks.com).

**Zacks Premium**

If you subscribe to the Zacks Premium subscription service, you will be included in our internal email and postal marketing lists. You will only be added to the Opt-In Marketing list if you do not uncheck the offer box included as part of registration. We collect your credit card information solely for payment of your subscription. It is shared only with our credit card processor in order to complete the transaction.

**Co-Registration**

In various registration processes on the Zacks web site, we offer you the opportunity to take free offers from third-party publishers by checking an "opt-in" box by each offer. If you check any box to receive an offer, your name, email address, and/or mailing address will be shared with the appropriate publisher.

**Paid Expert Newsletters**

If you decide to subscribe to any of our paid newsletters, we collect your credit card information solely for payment of your subscription, and it is shared only with our credit card processor in order to complete the transaction.

**Other Privacy Issues**

**Cookies:**  Zacks Investment Research uses cookies, tags, pixels and similar technologies to enhance your experience on the internet. These technologies allow us to recognize your preference information, keep track of the choices you make concerning the e-mails you wish to receive, and to facilitate effective Web site administration. You may elect to refuse cookies. Please refer to your browser’s Help instructions to learn more about cookies.

**Do Not Email Lists:**  If you opt out from a Zacks.com Opt-In Marketing List, Zacks Investment Research Internal List, or unsubscribe from a Zacks offer sent by another list vendor, you will be added to our Do Not Email list, and we will suppress your email address from future mailings to the Zacks Investment Research Internal List and Opt-In Marketing List, as well as any other Zacks mailings done through a third party. This process usually completes within 72 hours but can take up to 10 days in rare situations. However, if you later register for a Zacks product again, your name will be removed from the Do Not Email list.

Please note that while Zacks will not freely distribute the information you submit, if you click to unsubscribe from mailings sent to the Zacks.com Opt-In Marketing List from a particular marketer, we are obligated to share your email address with that marketer for the purpose of being added to their Do Not Mail list. How that mailer manages your email address after that time is beyond Zacks.com control.

**Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule:**  If a child has provided us with private information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should e-mail us to remove the information and unsubscribe the child from any promotional contact opportunities. Contact Information: If you experience any privacy related difficulties on Zacks.com, please use the following contact information: [support@zacks.com](mailto:support@zacks.com).

**Arbitration Agreement**

Any and all claims arising from or relating to the use of this website and/or any good or service offered or provided by us to you shall be subject to binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"). This includes claims based on contract, tort, equity, statute, or otherwise, as well as claims regarding the scope and enforceability of this provision. It includes all claims by or against you, us, and/or any affiliated person, company, and/or agent.

A single Arbitrator shall decide all claims and shall render a final, written decision. You may choose the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service ("JAMS"), or other similar arbitration service provider acceptable to us to administer the arbitration. Consistent with the FAA, the appropriate AAA rules, JAMS rules, or other service provider rules shall apply, as determined by the Arbitrator. For AAA and JAMS, these rules are found at www.adr.org and www.jamsadr.com.

Each party to the arbitration shall pay his, her, or its own costs of arbitration. If you cannot afford your arbitration costs, you may apply for a waiver under the relevant rules.

You and us waive any right to bring representative claims on behalf of a class of individuals, on behalf of the public, as a private attorney general, or otherwise (the "class action waiver"). Except for this class action waiver, this clause may be severed or modified if necessary to render it enforceable under the FAA.  The agreements and waivers contained in this section shall apply retroactively to any and all claims and causes of action that arise or arose at any time.

There may be delays, omissions, or inaccuracies in such information.

WE SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY, CONTINGENT OR OTHERWISE FOR THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS, OR CORRECT SEQUENCING OF ANY INFORMATION ON ZACKS.COM OR OTHERWISE DISTRIBUTED BY ZACKS INVESTMENT RESEARCH AND ITS AFFILIATES OR FOR ANY DECISION MADE OR ACTION TAKEN BY YOU IN RELIANCE UPON SUCH INFORMATION OR FOR INTERRUPTION OF ANY DATA, INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER ASPECT OF ZACKS.COM.
