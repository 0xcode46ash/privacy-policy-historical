Zarca.com Privacy Statement  
  
---  
  
Zarca Interactive ("Zarca") Statement on Privacy and Security of Information. The following policy explains our information gathering and dissemination practices.  
  
  
Please be aware that the Zarca services are not intended for children under the age of 18. At Zarca Interactive, we are extremely proud of our commitment to protect your privacy. We value your trust in us and assure you that we would use the information we collect only to provide a more personalized experience. We will work hard to earn your confidence so that you can enthusiastically use our services and recommend us to friends and family. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings. This document provides a thorough description of tools that Zarca provides to help you create and administer survey, and allow users to participate in surveys, and Zarca’s practices to help you understand Zarca’s approaches to privacy. You should carefully read this Privacy Statement (the "Statement"). If you have any questions about this Statement, email [privacy@Zarca.com](mailto:privacy@zarca.com).  
  
This Statement supplements the Zarca Interactive User Agreement (the "Agreement"). Thus, this Statement is incorporated into and governed by all of the terms of the Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Agreement and this Statement, the terms of this Statement shall control.  
  
This Statement applies only to information collected on the Zarca web site. It does not speak about Zarca Interactive’ practices for information collected elsewhere or the practices of any third parties, including those who may operate sites on Zarca Interactive’ behalf and that display Zarca branding.  
  
1\. Registered Users:  If you register on Zarca, we store your preferences and passwords for your convenience, to provide you with a more personalized experience. At present Zarca Interactive does NOT use cookies to store your login sessions.  
  
2\. Your Registration Information:  When you register, Zarca asks you for a number of pieces of information. If you register through a co-branded site or co-brand marketing affiliate, the co-brand partner may be transferring to Zarca some or all of the required registration information or possibly other information about you.  
  
  
3\. Use of Information:

Zarca uses registration information internally for a number of purposes, including:   
  
       
     • email distribution as described in the Agreement, as you request on the site (such as promotional opportunities or newsletters ) and for administrative purposes (such as to notify you about changes to the Agreement or this Statement or to contact you regarding your account details, Service updates or other problems with your account). In accordance with instructions on the site, you may opt not to receive certain emails in the future, and Zarca will use reasonable efforts to honor your request.  
  
     • display banner (and similar) advertising to you in connection with the site that is more targeted to you specifically. In doing this type of targeting, Zarca or its ad server, and not the advertiser, connect you with the targeting criteria.   
Through your account page, you have some choices about whether or not to display your registration information publicly on the Site..   
  
  
4\. Deletion of Registration Information:    
You may request to cancel your registration to the site or request the removal of your registration information from member records by emailing [support@Zarca.com](mailto:support@Zarca.com) which permission may or may not be granted. However, Zarca will send you an email to confirm your request. After you respond, Zarca will in most cases, remove your information from its "live" database, but residual information may remain in archives and records. Zarca may not be able to propagate changes to your registration information to its co-brand partners who have received such information. In addition, if your account is being terminated for violations of the Agreement, Zarca may keep some of your registration information active to prevent re-registration.  
  
  
5\. Survey Respondents:   
If you are participating in a survey either through an invitation from Zarca on behalf of a Zarca Customer or an invitation directly from the Customer or any other form of invitation, you may be required to disclose demographic and personal information. Your IP Address (see section 6) may also be logged. Zarca may also store your e-mail address in its database. This email address may be used in future by Zarca to announce new product offerings, newsletter and or other forms of communication. Zarca will in all such cases, provide you with clear instruction on ways and manners to unsubscribe and delete your details..   
  
  
6\. Internet Protocol Address (IP):    
Zarca logs Internet Protocol addresses for systems administration purposes. We also log IP addresses to track a user's session so that we know which parts of our site user’s visit. , IP addresses which are linked to study responses for our customers are used solely to ensure the accuracy of our Survey data.  
  
  
7\. Internal Analyses and Reports:   
Zarca may use all or some of the information in its databases, including personal information you've submitted, and other server and usage logs, to analyze the site and user behavior, troubleshoot technical problems, resolve disputes and address complaints, and prepare aggregated reports that maybe shared with the management of Zarca.  
  
  
8\. Other Information:   
Specific uses of personal information that vary from this Privacy Statement (if any) may be found throughout the site. To the extent that, during your submission of information on the site, you are notified of privacy practices that are different from those described in this Privacy Statement, those alternative disclosures will govern that submission.

There may be situations where Zarca collects data through a survey or similar process when the page does not link to this Statement. In those cases, unless you are informed otherwise, you should assume that Zarca treats all information from such pages as it treats its other valuable business records.

Of course, there are many other ways in which Zarca could get information from or about you that are not described elsewhere in this Statement. For example, you might send email through a customer service email address, or Zarca may get a complaint about you from a third party. Zarca's practices with respect to such information are pretty much as you'd expect-Zarca uses and discloses this information in a commercially reasonable business manner.  
  
  
9\. Contractors and Third Party Service Providers:   
Zarca may use contractors to help with its operations. Some or all of these contractors may access some parts of the registration database-- user information. Usually these contractors will enter into an agreement that places restrictive provisions on their use and disclosure of all information they obtain through the relationship.

Zarca may also use third party service providers to help with certain aspects of its operations that may require disclosure of your personal information to them. For example, Zarca may use a third party service provider to mail newsletter, send out email invitations to participate in surveys, serve ads, or deliver some or all of the emails sent as part of the site's normal operation. Again, usually Zarca will place extensive restrictions on the ability of these third parties to use and disclose your personal information except as necessary to perform the services they are asked to perform.  
  
  
10\. The "Corporate Family":   
Zarca may share some or all of your information with its subsidiaries or parent company (if any in future), in which case Zarca will ask such entities to honor the promises in this Statement. In addition, as part of a diligence review, Zarca may disclose some or all of your personal information to a potential acquirer or merger partner, although in this case Zarca would try to restrict their use and disclosure of this information.  
  
  
11\. Government Relations and Lawsuits:   
In some cases, the government can compel the disclosure of information about you, and of course Zarca will need to comply. However, irrespective of those situations, Zarca can unilaterally turn over information about you to the government if it believes such disclosure to be appropriate, in which case you authorize it to do so. You also consent to Zarca disclosing information about you to actual or potential parties to a lawsuit that Zarca is or may become involved in (a) if it are required to do so, (b) if it reasonably believes that such disclosures will potentially mitigate its liability, or (c) to enforce its rights.  
  
  
12\. Limits on Zarca' Abilities:   
A site and service as complicated as Zarca is never perfect, and thus Zarca may inadvertently make uses or disclosures of your information in ways not contemplated by, or in direct contravention of, this Statement. For example, if the software has a temporary glitch, your personal information could be displayed on the site even though you've configured your preferences otherwise. Zarca might also make ad hoc uses of your information in ways it can't contemplate here. Zarca will do its best to work with you if these types of situations arise, but your sole remedy in these cases is to have Zarca try to rectify the problem as soon as it can.

In addition, although highly unlikely, it is possible for Internet transmissions containing your personal information to be intercepted by others. It is impossible for Zarca to ensure the privacy and security of all transmissions made to and from the site while in transit.

Of course, Zarca does not control the privacy practices of its advertisers and other third-party sites that it promotes or links to. If you click through a banner ad or link and submit your information to an advertiser, you will be subject to their privacy policies. Please make sure you understand these policies before submitting your information.  
  
  
13\. Security Practices:    
Zarca uses advance industry-standard methods of securing its databases of user information, such as, if and where appropriate, firewalls, security-logs and limits on who can access user information databases. However, please keep in mind that there is no such thing as perfect security on the Internet.
