Osmnez clients have the responsibility to inform the individuals with whom they interact with via the help of the Service about the cookies used by Osmnez and by themselves and should obtain individuals’ consent, if necessary. 

###  Clear Gifs and Log Files 

We and our third party advertising partners may also employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), that help us better manage content on our Website by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users of our Website. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information. 

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients open. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. 

Do Not Track. Do Not Track (“DNT”) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third parties. We do not use technology that recognizes DNT signals from your web browser. 

###  Social Media Features and Features 

Our Website includes social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button, the “Share This” button or interactive mini-programs. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the Privacy Policy of the company providing them. 

###  Links to Third Party Sites 

Our Website contains links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by Osmnez. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personal information. 

###  Public Forums 

Our Website offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at privacy@zarget.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. 

###  Single Sign-On 

You can log in to our Website using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our Website to your profile page and to share information with others within your network. 

###  Communications from the Website 

We may use your email address to send our newsletters and/or marketing communications. If you no longer wish to receive these communications you can opt out by following the instructions contained in the emails you receive or by contacting us at [privacy@zarget.com.](mailto:privacy@zarget.com)

We will send you announcements related to the Service on occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you may deactivate your account. 

###  Advertising 

We partner with third-party advertising networks to either display advertising on our Website or to manage our advertising on other websites. Our ad network partner may use cookies and Web beacons to collect information about your activities on our Website and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. 

###  Protection of Information 

The Website and Service have industry standard security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. When you provide us with sensitive information (such as credit card information or login credentials), we will encrypt that information via Secure Socket Layer (SSL). 

While there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet, we take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of your personal information in accordance with standard market practices applicable to similar businesses. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Website or via the Service and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we receive your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. 

Additionally, you retain all rights of ownership to your personal data we collect. Except as set forth herein, we will not sell or share your personal data with any third parties or use your personal data to compete with you.
