## **9.** Remintrex

Remintrex is a web analysis service deployed by Remintrex GmbH, Adalbertstraße 5, 10999 Berlin, on behalf of cooperation partners. Remintrex is only deployed if you have given your consent, e.g. when registering for an internet promotion to a cooperation partner to send advertising via E-mail and/or SMS and/or to perform marketing calls to you and if you have also – as far as essential in the respective country and mandatory by law - agreed that Remintrex is deployed. Remintrex enables the cooperation partner to send advertising E-­‐Mails and/or SMS and/or to perform marketing calls matching the user behaviour on this website.

Remintrex uses cookies that are placed by the respective organiser, for instance for internet promotions, after the participant has given the organiser of the internet campaign his explicit consent to do so, if essential in the respective country and mandatory by law. When this website is visited the cookie sends a report to Remintrex GmbH as contract data processor of the cooperation partner that you (i.e. a user with the ID stored in the cookie) have visited the page, what product interested you and whether a contract came into being. The information is then stored separately for each individual cooperation partner on a server of Remintrex GmbH as contract data processor of the cooperation partners. With the communicated information Remintrex will – assuming you have agreed to receive advertising via E-­‐Mail and/or SMS and/or receive marketing calls and as far as essential in the respective country – be able to send you advertising E-­‐Mails and/or SMS and or to perform marketing calls on behalf of the cooperation partners and which give consideration to your user behaviour and thus also your interests.

The information communicated by the cookies will be used exclusively for advertising in which the products distributed on our pages are presented.

You can use your browser settings to delete the placed cookie at any time if you no longer wish for an analysis by Remintrex. You will find instructions about how to do this in the “Help” function of your browser.
