**Zango  
Privacy Policy**

(Last Revised May 14, 2004) 

This Privacy Policy is designed to explain how Zango, Inc. (referred to in this privacy policy as “we” or “Zango”) collects and uses information. By installing Zango software, you grant permission for Zango to periodically display targeted websites, to collect certain information, including the websites you visit while connected to the Internet, and to use that information as described herein. 

**Usage Data.** While Zango software is installed on your computer it generates logs of your web browsing activity, including web pages you have visited and the order in which you visited these pages. These logs may be uploaded to Zango’s servers, along with an anonymous user ID assigned to the Zango software installed on your computer (your “Anonymous User ID”). These logs and your Anonymous User ID are referred to collectively as “Usage Data.” Zango may use Usage Data for market research purposes and to provide you with content specifically targeted to your interests at times when we think the content is most relevant. Zango may store Usage Data on our servers, for our use, and may aggregate Usage Data from these logs and share the aggregate data with third parties. Zango software will also put a "cookie" on your machine so that we are able to recognize you and display appropriate targeted websites. A cookie is a small amount of data that Zango’s servers transfer to your browser and that only Zango’s servers can read. 

While complete URLs may be collected by Zango software and uploaded to our servers, efforts are taken to strip away any information that could be used to identify you personally before URLs are stored. While we cannot guarantee that all such information will be stripped away by our systems, **Zango will not use any of the Usage Data that Zango collects to identify you personally**. 

**Opt In Anonymous Information.** Occasionally, Zango may display additional questions to you, inviting you to opt in and supply anonymous information that may include demographic information (“Anonymous Information”). This Anonymous Information may include, but is not limited to, your age, gender, geographic region and interests. Zango uses this information to learn more about its audience and may share this information with third parties. Zango may also use this Anonymous Information in connection with your Anonymous User ID, however, Zango will not use Anonymous Information or Usage Data to identify you personally. Anonymous Information and Usage Data are primarily used by Zango to provide you with content and information at times when we think such information is likely to be relevant to you. 

**Opt In Personal Information.** Occasionally, Zango may display additional questions to you, inviting you to opt in and supply non-anonymous information that is unique to you, such as your name or contact information (“Personal Information”). This information will only be used for the purpose stated upon the request of such information, and Zango will not link or connect such Personal Information with any Usage Data to identify you personally. 

**IP Addresses.** Your use of Zango software will involve the transmission of your Internet protocol address (“IP Address”) to Zango’s servers. This IP Address is necessary for communication with you via the Internet and may be used and stored on our servers. With the cooperation of your Internet service provider, it is possible for your IP Address to be used to identify you personally, however, Zango agrees that it will not use it for this purpose, unless required to by law. 

**Third Party Collection.** Zango software will display to you targeted websites and advertisements that are hosted by third parties (“websites”). These websites may place cookies on your hard drive and use the cookies to tailor delivery of content to you by profiling your use of a site or advertisements that you select. These websites may collect information such as your IP address, your browser type and the date and time that the targeted website was served to you. To learn about how certain of these third parties collect and use information visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). 

**Disclosure.** Zango uses certain third party vendors (e.g., data storage and processing facilities) to assist Zango in providing our products and services. Zango may transfer your information to such vendors who have entered into a contract with Zango that protects your information as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Zango may also disclose your information as it believes is reasonably necessary to comply with law, regulation or other governmental authority or to prevent harm to yourself or others. Finally, Zango may disclose your personally identifiable information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of Zango’s stock or assets in Zango’s line of business to which this Privacy Policy relates or upon any other corporate reorganization. 

**Linking to Other Sites.** Please note: A link from a targeted website delivered by Zango does not imply our endorsement of that website, advertiser or product. We do not control the websites to which we link and assume no responsibility for their content or privacy policies. Any information that you provide to linked websites, or other third parties, is provided directly to such third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. Therefore, you should carefully review the privacy policies that apply to any sites you access from our site or any advertisers you respond to. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by Zango. 

**Zango Changes.** Zango reserves the right to change the provisions of this privacy policy at any time. Zango will post those changes on the Zango website located at <http://www.zango.com/AboutUs/Privacy.aspx> so you can be aware of what information we collect and how we use it. Your use of Zango software following the posting of such changes to the Zango Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of any such changes.
