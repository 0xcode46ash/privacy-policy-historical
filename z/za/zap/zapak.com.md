Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g. through registration), Zapak has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the User's hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the User's browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process that Zapak does not control.

Zapak's web servers automatically collect limited information about User's computer's connection to the Internet, including User's IP address, when the User visits our site. (User's IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User -- such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the User personally. Zapak uses this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor it's site to the interests of it's users, to measure traffic within it's site and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where Zapak's visitors come.

Zapak also includes links to other websites. Such websites are governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond Zapak's control. Once the User leaves Zapak's servers (the User can tell where he/she is by checking the URL in the location bar on the User's browser), use of any information provided by the User is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site which the User is visiting. That policy may differ from Zapak's own. If the User can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, the User may contact the site directly for more information.
