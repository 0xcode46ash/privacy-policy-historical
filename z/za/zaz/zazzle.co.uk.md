Zazzle will only collect, use, disclose and store any personal information from UK based persons in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act 1998 (the "Act") and this privacy policy. We have created this privacy policy to make sure you know what information we collect and how we use it. This privacy statement (together with the Zazzle Terms and Conditions and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. By agreeing to use the Zazzle Website you agree that you will allow Zazzle to use your personal information in conformity with the processes set out in the [Zazzle Terms and Conditions](http://www.zazzle.co.uk/mk/policy/user_agreement) of Service and this privacy statement. For the purpose of the Act, the data controller is Zazzle Inc. of 1900 Seaport Blvd., Redwood City, CA 94063. Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail or dialogue box. 

#### But first, a note about uploading and posting information on the Zazzle Website:

At the time you register for a MyZazzle account, you will choose and provide us with a user name and password. When you upload a design, post a comment or message on the Zazzle Website, or join a store's fan club, your user name is visible to other users. Additionally, if your comment or message contains personal information and is posted by you in a page that is accessible to the public, third parties may make note of the information and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties as a result. Any content or information you upload is not considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy. Always use care when you post such information. 

####  What information do we collect? 

#####  Information Provided by You: 

You may provide us with certain personally identifiable information when you: 

  * register for a MyZazzle account;
  * order products or gift certificates;
  * request customer support or send us any other communication;
  * sign up for newsletters, email alerts, and special offers;
  * set up a Seller or Associates account;
  * enter sweepstakes or contests;
  * sign up for, or redeem, special offers; 
  * respond to surveys; 
  * use our Email-to-a-Friend or Refer-A-Friend features; and
  * approve your child's request to open a MyZazzle account in accordance with The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA).



Such information may include your name, email address, IP address, billing address, shipping address, and credit card number. You may also provide us with information about other people, such as their email addresses, if you email a product to a friend or refer a friend to the Zazzle Website or our promotions. 

##### Information Collected by Cookies:

Zazzle uses cookies on the Zazzle Website. A cookie is a small text file on your computer which a website sends to your computer to allow the website to store information which uniquely identifies our users. Zazzle's cookies do not collect or store personally identifiable information. Rather, the cookie stores a token which uniquely identifies a particular user at a particular time. That token is then linked to the user information in our secured databases. You can always reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to display a message when a cookie is being sent. However, we rely on cookies for the proper operation of the Zazzle Website and if you reset your browser to refuse all cookies, some of the Zazzle Website features and functionality may not be available to you. 

##### Information Collected by Web Beacons and Log Files:

Zazzle collects certain information through the use of web beacons and log files. Such information may include your operating system, browser type, site usage, and whether you opened emails you received from us. 

####  How do we secure your information? 

When you place orders or access your account information, we use commercially reasonable and generally-accepted technological safeguards to secure any information we collect about you. The secure server software (SSL) we use encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. In addition, your MyZazzle account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. You should always take steps to protect the confidentiality of the password you select. 

We operate internationally and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States. As a result, your personal data will be processed by us in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. By creating a user account with us, and expressly assenting to this privacy policy, you have consented to the transfer of all information you provide to the United States solely for the purpose of providing you the services for which you have registered or subscribed. As described in this privacy policy, we take the utmost care to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized disclosure to any third party. 

#### How do we use information?

We use the personally identifiable information you provide to: 

  * provide the features and functionality of the Zazzle Website;
  * fulfill your requests for our products and services;
  * pay royalties and referral fees;
  * communicate with you about the status of your orders and other inquiries about our products and services;
  * send you information about our products and services; and
  * provide notices about the results of sweepstakes, contest, and other promotions.



We require an email address from you when you register for our services. We use your email address to communicate with you about your account and to send you certain notification emails. You can change the frequency of those emails in your MyZazzle account settings. 

We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send marketing messages unless you have consented to us doing so. Similarly, if you email a product to a friend or refer a friend to the Zazzle Website or our promotions, we will use your friend's email to send them the e-mail you requested. You and your friend's e-mail addresses will only be used for this purpose unless permission is otherwise granted. 

We use non-personally identifiable information to monitor the use and performance of the Zazzle Website so that we can learn more about how people use the Zazzle Website and improve our products and services. 

####  Does Zazzle disclose the information it collects to outside parties? 

Generally, Zazzle does not share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies without your consent except that: 

Zazzle provides information to its agents and trusted service providers and contractors who may be associated with us to help provide services to you, such as: fulfilling customer orders and processing credit card transactions; offering certain products and services; communicating with customers; providing customer service; managing information on our behalf; and enhancing the Zazzle Website features and functionality. In such cases, we require that these parties agree to use the information solely for the purpose for which we provided it to them and in accordance with our privacy policy. 

If you sign up for a promotion (e.g., a contest or sweepstakes offer) or enroll in a service we offer in partnership with a third party, we may provide information (such as your name, email address, and account activity) to such third parties with your consent. 

From time-to-time, Zazzle may provide its sellers with the first name and city/state/country of residence of Zazzle customers who have purchased such seller's products. 

Zazzle may also release information (including your name, addresses, telephone number, and account activity) when we, in our sole discretion believe that such release is necessary or appropriate to: 

  * comply with any legal obligation;
  * comply with subpoenas, warrants, court orders, government investigations, or other legal process;
  * enforce or apply the terms of any of User Agreement, Non-Exclusive License Agreement, or Associates Agreement; 
  * investigate or respond to allegations of fraud, intellectual property infringement, or other unlawful activity
  * investigate fraud or similar claims; or
  * protect the rights, property or safety of Zazzle, our users, or others. 



Additionally, Zazzle releases certain information to report the sale of custom postage to the United States Postal Service ("USPS"). As part of our relationship with the USPS, we collect and may disclose information about purchasers of our Zazzle Stamps products to the USPS at the request of USPS. To learn more about the USPS's privacy policy, please visit the [Privacy Policy](http://www.usps.com/homearea/docs/privpol_long.htm). 

#### Information transferred as the result of the sale of business

By registering with Zazzle you agree that Zazzle may disclose your personally identifiable information to any member of our group, which includes our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and their subsidiaries, and affiliates. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personally identifiable information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets if it is specifically relevant to them. In particular, if Zazzle or substantially all of its assets are acquired by another party, your personally identifiable information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party. In the case of any transfer of your personally identifiable information, you will be required to reconfirm your consent before any material changes can be made to the way your personally identifiable information is stored and used. 

#### What about Children's Privacy?

Children under the age of 13 are allowed to upload graphics and images and to order products with their parent's consent. To order products, the child must indicate his or her age, submit his or her name and his or her mailing address and shipping address if different from the mailing address together with a valid credit card number. In addition, in order to generate custom postage, we must collect and record the following information: the date and time of the custom postage order, and a unique order identification number. This is the only information collected from a child. 

This information is used to fulfil the requested order; confirm shipment; complete record keeping including royalty entitlements and pay royalty fees, if any, and to advise the child concerning new Zazzle products, services or policies. 

Parents of children under the age of 13 have the option to consent to the collection of this information from their children or not. Such consent will not be used as consent for the dissemination of any of this information and the information will not be released by Zazzle to third parties without the parents' consent except as may be required by law or upon court order. 

Personal information at Zazzle is kept confidential and is disclosed only with the consent of the Zazzle user or as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We do not engage in the selling of the habits, behavior, buying patterns, or demographic information of our users. Zazzle does not condition a child's participation in any on-line activity on the granting of any unnecessary information beyond that actually needed in connection with that activity. 

Parents can review any information Zazzle has received from a child and the parent can have that information deleted and the parent can forbid the collection of additional information from their child. If you want to review any information obtained from your child or if you want to have any information obtained from your child deleted from the Zazzle records or to forbid any use of such information, you may send a request to Zazzle Customer Support by logging into Zazzle, going to: 

Contact Us, and sending an email relating to Parental Notification. Alternatively, you may contact the Zazzle Child Privacy Representative by email, or letter at:

####  Access to information 

The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a small administration charge to meet our costs in providing you with the details of the information we hold about you. 

####  How can I change, delete, or update my information? 

Most of your account information can be changed in the MyZazzle section of the Zazzle Website. If you have any questions about what information is stored or would like to obtain a copy of such information, please contact us at [privacy@zazzle.co.uk](mailto:privacy@zazzle.co.uk) or Privacy c/o Zazzle Inc., 1900 Seaport Blvd, Redwood City, CA 94063.
