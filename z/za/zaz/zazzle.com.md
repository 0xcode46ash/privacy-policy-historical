# Zazzle.com

At Zazzle.com, Inc. ("Zazzle"), we are committed to protecting your privacy. We have taken great efforts to keep your information confidential and secure at all times within our system. Zazzle is not an "information broker." We do not engage in the selling of the habits, behavior, buying patterns, or demographic information of our users. We use the information we collect about you to process orders, pay royalties and provide the best service possible. We may revise this Privacy Policy occasionally, so please check it frequently.

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**

 _Ordering_  
When you place an order, we need to know your name, mailing address, billing address, email address, credit card number and its expiration date. All of this information is necessary for us to complete the transaction and notify you of your order status. If you are ordering for the first time, we also require that you choose a user name and password so that we can create your account. Finally, we maintain a history of the products you have ordered. _Registration_  
When you register a MyZazzle account with us, you must choose a username and password to access your account. You must also provide your name, street address, and email address so that we may contact you, when necessary, concerning activity that is relevant to your account. Finally, in order to comply with The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), you must provide your date of birth to confirm that you are 13 years of age or older. _Children's Privacy_  
If you are a child under 13 years of age, we and COPPA require that your parents be informed of your intent to create an account at Zazzle. You will only be able to enter a username, password, and your parent's email address. Your parent will be contacted via email and must give permission for you to register an account at Zazzle. If we do not receive your parent's permission in a timely fashion, your username, password, and parent's email address will be deleted and you will not have a Zazzle account. If we receive your parent's permission, you may create a Zazzle account. As with all personal information collected at Zazzle, your data will be kept confidential and will never be sold, shared, or leased to any third party. _Royalty Payment_  
When you contribute products to a public gallery, we need to know your name, street address, and email address so that we can pay you for the royalties you have earned on your product sales.

**How does Zazzle protect customer information?**  
When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Your MyZazzle account information is password-protected for your privacy and security.

**What about cookies?**  
A cookie is a small text file on your computer which a web site uses to store information. We use cookies for the sole purpose of uniquely identifying our users and securing their personal information. Actually, the information itself is never retained in the cookie. Rather, the cookie stores a token which uniquely identifies a particular user at a particular time. That token is then linked to the user information in our secured databases.

**Will Zazzle disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**  
Zazzle does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to outside parties. Zazzle may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of Zazzle, our users, or others.

**How can account information be changed or updated?**  
Any or all of your account information can be changed in the MyZazzle section of the site under Member Account.

**Your consent and changes to the Privacy Policy**  
By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this policy and to our User Agreement. Zazzle may decide to change this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

**Who do I ask for additional questions?**  
Feel free to contact us with any additional questions that you may have at [privacy@zazzle.com](mailto:privacy@zazzle.com) or 800-980-9890.

The current version of the Zazzle Privacy Policy was adopted effective as of 7/13/2004.
