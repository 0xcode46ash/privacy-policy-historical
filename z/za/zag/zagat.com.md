**How We Use Your Information**  
We use your e-mail address and home address to send you updates and newsletters periodically about new features, special offers and targeted promotional items available on zagat.com.

We also may share this demographic information with other companies with which we do business. 

**With Whom We Share Information**  
We share your personally identifiable information with intermediaries. These intermediaries use your information in connection with processing payments for online purchases and with delivery of e-mail and postal mailings to our registered users. We do not permit these intermediaries to use, store or retain this information for secondary purposes, unless they indicate otherwise in communications to you.

You may choose not to receive these communications from our partners by so indicating during the registration process or in response to any of these communications, each of which will clearly explain how to opt out of future communications. You may also opt out of having your personal information shared with these third parties by sending a request to have your zagat.com user account deactivated to feedback@zagat.com. If you do so, however, you will not be able to take advantage of many of our features, including the right to vote online, purchase items from our store and even continue as a subscriber to zagat.com. This site makes use of certain technology designed to enhance your browsing experience and provide analytics including ClickTracks, SearchIgnite and Fireclick. These technologies, provided as a hosted service application, provide aggregate reporting information to the site owner only, through cookies that they set at zagat.com.

We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform with the law or legal process or to protect or defend our rights or property. 

**Security**  
zagat.com has security measures in place to help protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All information is stored in a secure operating environment.
