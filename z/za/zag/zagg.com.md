## Security Policy

We want your ZAGG online shopping experiences to be safe and secure. Therefore, ZAGG has invested in state-of-the-art technologies that enable us to provide the highest level of safety surrounding your personal information as you shop with us online. We utilize Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt the data you provide to us while online placing an order.

Some computers may not be able to "communicate" with our secure server. If you experience any difficulty, please feel free to call The ZAGG Team at 800-700-ZAGG (9244) to place your order over the phone. 

In addition to encrypting your credit card information while it travels over the Internet, for your security, we do not store your credit card information on our systems.

ZAGG is committed to your online security and to prove this, we offer extra protection. If, after making a purchase at zagg.com, your credit card information is compromised and fraudulent charges appear on your bank or credit card statement, please notify your bank or credit card company to report the fraudulent charges. Credit card companies may require consumers to pay up to $50 for those fraudulent charges under federal law. For extra protection, ZAGG will reimburse you up to $50.00 for any fraudulent charges your bank or credit card company may require you to pay.
