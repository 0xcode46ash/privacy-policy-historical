## Privacy Policy

When you visit Invisibleshield.com, our commitment to you as our valued customer is to provide an exciting shopping experience, as well as the elevated level of personal service that is synonymous with invisibleSHIELD. In order to do so, we may obtain information about you so that we may provide you with all of the wonderful benefits that invisibleSHIELD offers. Because we respect your privacy, we always handle this information in a safe and responsible manner.

So that you may make the most of your shopping experience, we learn about the products and services that are of interest to you when you visit invisibleSHIELD.com. In turn, we may from time to time provide you with information related to those products and services. When you provide invisibleSHIELD with information, that information is safely stored. invisibleSHIELD does not share or sell your personal information with any outside companies for the purposes of marketing. invisibleSHIELD may responsibly share some information with other members of our invisibleSHIELD family of companies and with outside companies that we ask to perform services for us, such as maintaining a database of customer information or preparing and distributing e-mail messages to our customers. We require that these outside companies agree to keep confidential all information we share with them and to use the information only to perform their obligations in the agreements for our purposes.

We will continue to find new ways to enhance your invisibleSHIELD online shopping experience. We welcome your periodic review of our Privacy Policy as we update it to reflect improved technologies and services.

## Security Policy

We want your invisibleSHIELD online shopping experiences to be safe and secure. Therefore, invisibleSHIELD has invested in state-of-the-art technologies that enable us to provide the highest level of safety surrounding your personal information as you shop with us online. We utilize Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt the data you provide to us while online placing an order.

Some computers may not be able to "communicate" with our secure server. If you experience any difficulty, please feel free to call our Customer Service at 1.801.263.0699 to place your order.

In addition to encrypting your credit card information while it travels over the Internet, for your security, we do not store your credit card information on our systems.

For extra protection, we will do the following for you. If you make a purchase online at invisibleSHIELDs online store invisibleSHIELD.com and as a result, through no fault of your own, the credit card information is stolen and fraudulent charges are made to your account, you must first notify the issuer of your credit card in accordance with the issuer's rules about these fraudulent charges. If your credit card company makes you pay any part of these fraudulent charges (under federal law your credit card company can only make you pay up to $50), invisibleSHIELD will reimburse you for the amount your credit card company required you to pay, up to $50.

If you prefer to submit your order by telephone, please call us any time at 1.801.263.0699.

Thank you for your loyalty as we continue to serve you.
