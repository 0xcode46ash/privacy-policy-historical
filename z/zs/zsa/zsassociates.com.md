## ZS Associates  
Web Site Privacy Policy  
Last Updated: May 19, 2015

## Privacy Policy

ZS Associates is committed to protecting the privacy of our clients and any other visitors to our Web site. This Privacy Policy describes our current practices regarding the personal data that we collect from you when you visit and use our Web site. Personal data is information that identifies you, such as your name, e-mail address, or mailing address.

This Privacy Policy applies to this Web site or any online service we offer that links to this Privacy Policy. Other sites and services we offer may have different privacy policies that apply to them.

If you are a current, prospective, or former ZS employee, please review ZS’s Employee Privacy Notice available when you apply to a job and on the company’s intranet. 

By using this Web site and providing us with any of your personal data, you consent to us collecting and processing your data as described below.

**Data We Collect**

We collect both anonymous and identifiable information about our Web site users. We only collect identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us. You are not required to provide us with identifiable information to use this Web site.

**Sensitive Personal Data**

We do not intentionally collect any sensitive personal data through our Web site. Sensitive personal data means the various categories of personal data identified by applicable data privacy laws as requiring special treatment. These categories can include data relating to ethnic origin or race, marital status, political opinions or affiliations, trade union membership, religious beliefs, physical or mental health, sexual orientation, or criminal record. We therefore suggest that you do not provide sensitive personal data of this type to us. If you do provide us with any sensitive personal data, you are consenting to us using this data in the ways described in this Privacy Policy.

**Anonymous Data We Collect**

We use technologies that collect anonymous information about the use of our Web site. This technology does not identify you personally. We use this information to compile statistics about our visitors and the ways they use our Web site. For example, we log which pages users access and which Web browsers and operating systems they use. We may also determine which domain you are coming from before visiting our Web site to more accurately gauge our users' demographics.

**Identifying Data We Collect**

If you choose to subscribe to one of our blogs or to receive access to some of our thought-leadership materials, you will be asked to provide us with some personal data, including your name and e-mail address. We will use this information to provide you with the subscriptions and materials you request. With your permission, we may also use this information to provide you with details about our products and services that may be of interest to you.

Portions of our Web site, such as our blogs, allow users to post comments. These comments are reviewed before appearing online, and, once posted, are publicly available. In order to leave a comment, you may be required to enter your name and e-mail address. Your e-mail address will not appear online unless you include it within the text of your comment. Please be careful about including any personal data in any comments you make.

On occasion, we may have surveys available through our Web site that you can voluntarily participate in. We will compile the results of these surveys to create reports available through our Web site or to provide to our clients or third parties. Information we collect from you through these surveys will be anonymized and aggregated so that the final reports will not include any information that can identify you. Please be aware that any information that you provide to us in survey responses will belong to us.

We will also collect your device’s IP address. This data is collected automatically when you access our Web site in order to provide the services to you. This information also helps us to diagnose problems with our server and to improve the services we offer to you. 

**Tracking Technologies We Use**

In order to collect the anonymous data described above, we may use cookies. A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser and stored in your device’s memory. You may be able to set your browser or device to notify you when you receive a cookie. This would enable you to decide if you want to accept it or not. However, some of the services and features offered through our online services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

We use cookies to deliver services requested by you, as well as to improve the quality of our online services by storing user preferences and monitoring user trends. We use several types of cookies: 

  * Authentication and authorization cookies allow access to secure areas and specific functionality of the online services. These are strictly necessary for the proper operation of our Web site and the services that we provide to you.
  * Personalization cookies allow our Web site to remember choices you make and provide personalized features. They may also be used to provide services in the way you have specified.
  * Tracking cookies collect information about how you use our Web site, what pages you visit on our Web site, and how often. We use this information to improve our Web site.



At this time due to a lack of industry standards, our Web site does not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals. 

We also use pixel tags (also known as web bugs, web beacons, clear gifs, and other terms) in the marketing e-mails we send. These non-intrusive tags help us know when you view our e-mails. We use this information to understand what kinds of content are of interest to you. You may be able to disable such tracking by setting your e-mail client to display messages as text only or by turning off image display.

**Confidentiality of Client Information**

Consistent with our client obligations, it has always been our policy to exercise the utmost discretion regarding the information our clients entrust to us. We accept and process confidential client information subject to our client’s direction and control, and we maintain reasonable and appropriate security precautions. Because we operate globally, our systems may make data related to your matters accessible from our various offices around the world, and we often transfer client data between our offices. This data is transferred in accordance with the requirements of our intra-group data transfer agreement based on the Standard Contractual Clauses defined in Directive 95/46/EC.

We never rent, trade, sell, or share your information with any unrelated parties except as necessary or appropriate to conduct our business activities, subject to appropriate confidentiality, privacy, and information security commitments provided by the receiving party; or to further your interests; or as permitted or required by law; or as authorized or directed by you. Please feel free to raise any questions, concerns or specific directions you may have regarding the privacy and security of your information to the ZS Associates Principal who is handling your matter or to [dataprivacy@zsassociates.com](mailto:dataprivacy@zsassociates.com).

If we are processing your information on behalf of a third party (such as our client), we will follow the processing instructions that the third party provided us.

We may use your information to carry out contracts or comply with applicable laws or regulations.

**Disclosures and Transfers of Your Data to Third Parties**

We do not rent, sell, share, or otherwise distribute your personal data to unrelated third parties except as required by law and in these circumstances: 

  * Your personal data may be shared with other companies within our group of companies or with contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal data confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them, per the purpose and with your consent as set out in this Privacy Policy. 
  * We may share, transfer, or disclose the information in our databases and server logs in the event of our sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar event, as well as to comply with a contractual obligation with our clients, protect your vital interests, and/or protect the security or integrity of our databases or services. We will inform you of any such transfer or disclosure as required by law.



**How to Access or Correct Your Personal Data**

If you send us a request to view, correct, or delete the personal data we hold about you, we will make every attempt to honor your request within a reasonable period of time. If we are unable to complete your request because we are unable to locate your data or due to legal restrictions, we will let you know. These requests should be sent to us at [dataprivacy@zsassociates.com](mailto:dataprivacy@zsassociates.com). 

**Location of Your Data and Transfers of Your Data Abroad**
