Zscaler has certified that it complies with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. Zscaler’s commitment to the Privacy Shield Principles is described in its Privacy Shield Policy. 

All legislation referred to herein requires that the relationship between a data controller and a data processor is covered by a contract before outsourcing related to the processing of personal data takes place. The purpose of the contract is to protect the interests of the data controller, who is the entity that determines the purposes and means of processing, and who retains full responsibility for the data with regards to the individuals concerned. The contract thus specifies the processing to be carried out and any measures necessary to ensure that the data is kept secure.

Zscaler’s obligations may vary according to the jurisdiction of our customer and their area of business. The typical obligations to ensure compliance with the most common data privacy legislation are as follows:

To ensure that we process personal data in accordance with relevant privacy regulations, we will only offer our services pursuant to a contract which defines the obligations of Zscaler and our customer according to applicable privacy legislation. We will always require our customers to comply with relevant privacy legislation as the data controller.
