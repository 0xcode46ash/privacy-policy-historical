The term data controller is defined in US Safe Harbor and EU privacy legislation as the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. The data controller retains full responsibility for the data with regards to the individual(s) concerned. The term data processor means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which processes personal data on behalf of the data controller.

## EU Safe Harbor and Swiss Safe Harbor Policy

Zscaler historically has complied with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Zscaler historically has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. 

All legislation referred to herein requires that the relationship between a data controller and a data processor is covered by a contract before outsourcing related to the processing of personal data takes place. The purpose of the contract is to protect the interests of the data controller, i.e. the person or body who determines the purposes and means of processing, and who retains full responsibility for the data with regards to the individuals concerned. The contract thus specifies the processing to be carried out and any measures necessary to ensure that the data is kept secure.

### Zscaler Obligations 

Zscaler’s obligations may vary according to the jurisdiction of our customer and their area of business. The typical obligations to ensure compliance with the most common privacy legislation are as follows: to comply with the U.S. Safe Harbor principles, EU data protection legislation or other similar national legislation as a data processor, to ensure that the data is only used for the purpose of providing our web security service and any other purposes that are authorized and/or requested by our customer, and to keep the personal data confidential.

### Customer Obligations

To ensure that we process personal data in accordance with relevant privacy regulations we will only offer our services pursuant to a contract which defines the obligations of Zscaler and our customer according to applicable privacy legislation. We will always require our customers to comply with relevant privacy legislation as the data controller. Zscaler does not control the sharing of personal information related to our service. This is governed by our customer, who is the data controller, in accordance with the customer’s privacy policy and applicable privacy legislation.

### Zscaler May Transfer Personal Data When Legally Required To Do So
