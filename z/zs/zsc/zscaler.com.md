Zscaler is a data processor which processes web traffic on behalf of its client who is the data controller.  Clients contract with Zscaler to deliver such web traffic security services.  The term data controller is defined in US Safe Harbor and EU privacy legislation as the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. The data controller retains full responsibility for the data with regards to the individual(s) concerned.  The term data processor means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.  
All legislation referred to herein requires that the relationship between a data controller and a data processor is covered by a contract before outsourcing related to the processing of personal data takes place. The purpose of the contract is to protect the interests of the data controller, i.e. the person or body who determines the purposes and means of processing, who retains full responsibility for the data with regards to the individuals concerned. The contract thus specifies the processing to be carried out and any measures necessary to ensure that the data are kept secure.   
_Zscaler obligations.   _Zscaler’s obligations may vary according to the jurisdiction of our client and their area of business. The typical obligations to ensure compliance with the most common privacy legislation are: to comply with the U.S. Safe Harbor principles, EU data protection legislation or other similar national legislation as a data processor; to ensure that the data is only used for the purpose of providing our web security service and purposes that are authorized and requested by our client; to keep the data confidential.  
_Client obligations_.  To ensure that we process personal data in accordance with relevant privacy regulations we will only offer our service under a contract which defines the obligations of Zscaler and our client according to applicable privacy legislation. We will always require our clients to comply with relevant privacy legislation as the data controller.  Zscaler does not control the sharing of personal information related to our service. This is governed by our client, the data controller, in accordance with the client privacy policy and applicable privacy legislation.  
  
_Zscaler may transfer personal data when legally required to do so.   _Zscaler will not transfer personal data to other entities without authorization or request from our client unless Zscaler is legally required to do so, for example, by a court order or subpoena.  
  
_Who should End Users contact regarding privacy?_ If you are an end-user of our service you should contact our client for any information related to information held about you and the privacy policy which governs the relationship between you and our client.  In many cases our client will be your employer.   
_Access by Zscaler employees.   _We intend to protect individual personal information and to maintain its privacy. Zscaler implements reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help us protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure. For example, we encrypt certain sensitive personal information when we transmit such information over the Internet. We also limit access to private and confidential data on our systems to only those employees with a specific need to retrieve this information.
