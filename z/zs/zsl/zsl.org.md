ZSL are committed to protecting your privacy in accordance with their obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998. This privacy policy explains what information ZSL collects about you and how it will be used. When you access and use this website you agree to be legally bound by all our terms and conditions as well as our privacy policy outlined below.  
 **Transactions**  
ZSL make every effort to maintain customer confidentiality when securing an online payment. This includes ensuring the security of your credit card details and other personal information. All of your personal information is encrypted as it travels over the internet. When you make a booking, you enter a secure internet site (indicated by the letters https:// in the address bar and or a padlock displayed in your web browser). To protect you against credit card fraud (where someone has discovered your credit card details but do not have your card), you will be asked to enter the unique security code printed on the back of your payment card. 

**What information do we collect?**  
ZSL collect information from you to enable us to provide you with the goods and services you ask for. This may include your name, address, telephone, email address, credit or other payment card details. ZSL do not retain payment card details following completion of a transaction. If any of the information you have provided changes at any time or appears to be incorrect please let ZSL know by sending an email to [hyperlink] editor@zsl.org

ZSL will use the information you enter into the website only for administration purposes and any other purposes made clear in the data entry forms themselves, in any relevant terms or conditions and on any pages or emails that link to such forms.  
ZSL may also collect internet protocol addresses to diagnose problems with our servers and for system administration, but ZSL do not link these addresses to any person’s name or identity.

Whenever ZSL ask you for information about yourself you may, by ticking the relevant box, opt out of receiving other communications. In addition, whenever you receive other communications by email you will be told how to opt out of being updated by email in the future. If you choose to opt out of being updated as described above ZSL will cease all such future disclosure of data.

Please let ZSL know if you want details of the personal information we hold about you by emailing [hyperlink] editor@zsl.org.

In no circumstances will ZSL collect any data that is not directly related to the use of this website so, for example, we will not record other sites that you have visited.

### Third Parties

In order to process ticket bookings, an order for goods, an application for membership and/or for adopting an animal, ZSL may pass your personal information and payment details to third party providers and, where it is lawfully requested to do so, regulatory authorities. Such third party providers will only have access to the personal information needed to perform the relevant service. They may not use your personal information for any other purposes and are required to process your personal information in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.  
ZSL will not otherwise provide any of the personal information you give to us to any third party for any purpose unconnected with a transaction you initiate, except with your prior express consent.

### International transfer of information

ZSL will retain the personal information you provide within the United Kingdom, and will not transfer it to any other country except with your prior and express consent; however the internet is global and it is possible that information you provide to ZSL will be temporarily transferred via a route outside the European Economic Area as it passes between you and this website or a third party provider.
