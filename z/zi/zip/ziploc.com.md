**Last Updated: December 4, 2012**

SC Johnson values the trust you place in us when you provide us with your personal information. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting it. 

This Privacy Notice applies to any personal information SC Johnson collects online. 

This Privacy Notice explains: 

  * How we collect and type of information collected
  * How we use information
  * When we share personal information
  * How we safeguard information
  * More on cookies, beacons, and how to stop automated collection of information
  * More on on-line advertising in unrelated websites (third party ad serving or targeted advertising) and how to stop its delivery
  * What laws govern the operation of SC Johnson's USA websites AND international transfers of personal information
    * Information about SC Johnson's participation in US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor
  * How we will inform you of changes to this Privacy Notice

SC Johnson websites may contain links to the websites of other companies. These websites may collect data independently of SC Johnson. Please be aware that we do not control and are not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of the websites of other companies. You should review the privacy notices of these websites before deciding whether to submit information to them. 

**PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR WEBSITES ARE NOT INTENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13\. IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 13, PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION OF ANY KIND. WE DO NOT COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM ANY PERSON WE ACTUALLY KNOW IS AN INDIVIDUAL UNDER THE AGE OF 13.**

**PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY NOTICE CAREFULLY, BECAUSE BY USING OUR WEBSITES YOU ARE ACKNOWLEDGING YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY NOTICE.**

**How we collect and type of information collected**

We collect information in three ways: when _you_ provide information to us, when information is collected _automatically_ , or when information is _shared_ with us by a third party. 

  * **Information _you_ provide to us through one of our websites or the website of one of our promotional or advertising partners**



We do not collect personal information through the use of automated technology such as "cookies" or "beacons" (more on cookies, beacons, and how to stop automated collection later in this Privacy Notice). 

We collect personal information such as name, date-of-birth, mailing address, and email address when you provide it through registration to receive emails, request information, submit comments or participate in a promotion (e.g., contest or sweepstakes) or survey. For example, if you are on the website of a TV network, viewing SC Johnson content such as a product promotion, and you _opt-in_ to receive information from SC Johnson, the TV network website will submit to us the information you provided so we may contact you as requested. 

If a SC Johnson website offers shopping or other commercial services, you will use an order-form to request information, products and services. The order-form may ask you to provide financial information like account or credit card numbers. This information is transmitted to us through a secured browsing session. Do not send us any financial information outside the secured browsing session. 

  * **Information we collect _automatically_ when you visit one of our websites or the website of one of our promotional or advertising partners **



We _do not_ collect _personal information_ through the use of automated technology such as cookies or beacons. 

We _do_ use (place in your browser) cookies or beacons to automatically collect _general non-personal information_ when you visit one of our websites (more on cookies, beacons, and how to stop automated collection later in this Privacy Notice). 

In cases when you are on the website of one of our promotional or advertising partners, our cookies or beacons are placed in your computer via SC Johnson content that you may be viewing (e.g., a product promotion or advertisement). The practice of displaying advertisements on the websites of unrelated companies is called "Third Party Ad Serving" (more on on-line advertising in unrelated websites (third party ad serving or targeted advertising) and how to stop its delivery later in this Privacy Notice). 

The type of information we may collect automatically includes: 

  * internet browser type 
  * computer type 
  * IP address** 
    * NOTE**: An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) so you can access the internet. Some ISPs assign a new IP address every time you access the internet while other ISPs assign you the same number every time you access the internet. In instances when you are assigned the same IP address, it is possible for information about your browsing habits to be associated with your individual personal computer. 
  * operating system 
  * webpages visited 
  * links clicked 
  * date and time of visits 



This information helps us provide a better website experience by diagnosing problems with our servers, evaluating site navigation and better understanding the demographics of our site visitors so we can provide more relevant content, functionality and offers. 

We also may receive information about you from social networking sites if you or other users (e.g., your "friends") give us access to your profiles, comments, "connections", if you "like" us, or if you choose to participate in a SC Johnson sponsored page or program residing in a social networking site (e.g., SC Johnson's Facebook page). The type of information that we may receive includes lists of your friends, comments you have shared, groups and location. 

  * **Information _shared_ with us by a third party**



We may receive information about you from other sources such as public databases, data aggregators or companies/websites where you have consented to have your information shared with other companies. For example, if you are on the website of a TV network viewing content from a TV show, you may have an opportunity to sign-up to receive periodic communication/news about the TV show. While you are registering, the TV network also may ask you if you would like to have your information shared with the TV network's partners. If you decide to do so and SC Johnson is one of the TV network partners then we may receive some of your information. 

**How we use information**

We use information as follows: 

  * respond to your questions and requests 
  * provide you with information about our company, our products, services, promotions and other special offers 
  * personalize your website experience through tailored content, ads and offers 
  * communicate with you about your account and, in our discretion, changes to any SC Johnson policy that may affect you 
  * make our websites easier to use with better content by understanding how people use our sites, products and services 
  * process transactions 
  * implement other activities disclosed at the time you provide your information and consent 



To the extent that you provide us with financial information in connection with shopping or commercial services, we will use the financial information to bill you for products and/or services. By submitting your credit card and related personal information, you are authorizing our store to give that information to the merchant and credit card company for order confirmation and fulfillment. 

**When we share personal information**

We will not provide your personal information to third parties without your consent _except_ for the situations described below. 

  * **Your agreement to have your personal information shared with third parties**



While on our websites, you may have the opportunity to opt-in to receive information and/or marketing offers from another company or consent to the sharing of your information with a third party, including social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter. If you agree to have your personal information shared, your personal information will be disclosed to the third party, and the personal information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and business practices of that third party. 

  * **SC Johnson affiliates**



We may share your personal information with affiliates in the family of companies controlled by SC Johnson, primarily for business and operational purposes. 

  * **Third parties providing services on our behalf**



We may share your personal information with unrelated companies that help us carry out your requests, make various features, services and materials available through our websites and respond to your inquiries. We require that these unrelated companies do not share your personal information and that they comply with our instructions on the security and use of your personal information. 

  * **Legal proceedings**



We may share your personal information with third parties to comply with a legal obligation such as: at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; to verify or enforce our websites' terms of use or other applicable policies; or to protect the rights, property, safety or security of visitors to our websites, the public or third parties. 

**How we safeguard information**

We take information security seriously and use industry-accepted security measures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, loss, or misuse. For example, we store personal information on computer systems with limited access and these systems are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit very confidential information (e.g., a credit card number) over the internet, we protect it through the use of data encryption methods. 

Please remember not to ever send your credit card numbers, social security, or any personal passwords through unsecured email. Also remember not to ever share your passwords, never leave your computer unattended, and always log-out when you are done using it. 

**More on cookies, beacons, and how to stop automated collection of information**

SC Johnson uses automated technology only to collect general non-personal information. Automated collection of information occurs mainly through the use of two technologies: cookies and web beacons. 

  * **More on "Cookies"**



**_What is a cookie_** \-- A cookie is a small file that a website you are visiting places in your computer through your internet browser. Cookies have the ability to identify your computer and store information like web pages visited, advertisements viewed, frequency, and type of browser used. 

Cookies are usually managed through your internet browser. 

If the website you are visiting provides free content (e.g., espn.com) then it is likely that you will also see advertisements of other websites/companies. If so, the website you are visiting and the companies that sponsor the advertisements may place their own cookies in your computer. Displaying on-line advertisements in unrelated websites is primarily accomplished through a practice called "Third Party Ad Serving" (more on on-line advertising in unrelated websites (Third Party Ad Serving or targeted advertising) and how to stop its delivery later in this Privacy Notice). 

**_How are cookies used_** \-- Cookies are normally used to help with security (e.g., time you out of a secured browsing session after a certain period of inactivity), site navigation (e.g., remember your preferences so that you don't need to reenter information like language preference), and improve your browsing experience (e.g., deliver content, advertisements, or offers that are consistent with your browsing habits). 

Cookies can remain in your computer for the duration of a browsing session or for a predetermined period of time. Cookies that remain in your computer for the duration of a browsing session are called "session" cookies (e.g., the contents of an online "shopping basket" will disappear at the end of your browsing session). Cookies that remain in your computer for a predetermined period of time are called "persistent" cookies (e.g., selecting English in a website that offers content in multiple languages so that the content is displayed in English when you return to the website even weeks or months later). 

**_How to delete cookies_** \-- Please be aware that deleting cookies will likely have a negative effect on the performance of the websites you visit and, consequently, you may not be able to see content or use applications offered through the websites. 

To delete cookies that have been installed in your computer, please refer to your browser's help menu. Normally, you will need to take the following actions: 

For Internet Explorer: 

  * Click on Internet Explorer 
  * Select the "search" button on the tool bar 
  * Enter "cookie" into the search box field for "folder and files" 
  * Choose "my computer" in the "look in" drop-down menu 
  * Click "search now" 
  * Select and open the folders that are retrieved 
  * Click to highlight any cookie file 
  * Click the "delete" key to erase the cookie file 



For other browsers: 

  * Click the "help" function of your "start" button and enter "cookies" to search for information on how to locate the folder that contains the cookie files you want to delete. Below are links to some of the most popular internet browsers where you can find additional information on managing cookies: 
    * [Internet Explorer](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/internet-explorer9-plus.html)
    * [ Firefox](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/firefox2-plus.html)
    * [ Chrome](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/google-chrome.html)
    * [ Safari](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/safari.html)
    * [ OperaM](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/opera.html)

  * **More on web "beacons"**



**_What is a web beacon_** \-- Web beacons are small pieces of computer code placed in transparent graphic images displayed in websites you may be viewing or emails you may receive. Web beacons are not noticeable since they are usually placed within a very small portion of an image being observed. Web beacons are also known as pixel tags, clear GIFs, and web bugs. 

**_How are web beacons used_** \-- Web beacons are normally used to monitor website traffic. Web beacons can also be used with cookies to gain an understanding of how website users navigate and process the content contained in websites. For example, a company owning a network of websites may use web beacons to count and recognize users travelling through its multiple websites. Being able to recognize users allows the website owner to personalize users' visits and make them more user-friendly. 

**_How to delete web beacons_** \-- To delete web beacons, you will need to delete cookies from your browser (see the section above on "how to delete cookies"). 

You can learn more about web beacons at: 

<http://www.allaboutcookies.org/faqs/beacons.html>

**More on online advertising in unrelated websites (Third Party Ad Serving or targeted advertising) and how to stop its delivery**

**_What is third party ad serving/targeted advertising_** \-- Third party ad serving is the most common practice of delivering advertisements in the websites of unrelated companies. For example, when you visit the website of a sports' network such as espn.com, you may see advertisements from unrelated sporting equipment companies. 

**_How does third party ad serving/targeted advertising work_** \-- Third party ad serving utilizes technology such as cookies and web beacons to assemble usage information from websites you've visited. This information is utilized to guess your potential interests and match them with potential suppliers of related product and services. If one of these potential suppliers has contracted with a website that you are visiting to deliver its corresponding advertisement, your internet browser will assemble appropriate ad information and deliver it to you while you are browsing on the unrelated website. 

**_How to limit Third Party Ad Serving_** \-- If you prefer to limit or not receive third party advertising, look for an "AdChoices" icon in or near to the advertising you are viewing. By selecting this icon, you should be redirected to a website that should allow you to limit or stop the delivery of advertisements to your computer. However, you should know that the "AdChoices" icon can only help you limit advertisements from companies that have signed-up to use the "AdChoices" icon to manage Third Party Ad Serving. 

To the extent an advertisement does not include the AdChoices icon, you should visit the website where you are receiving the third party ad (espn.com in the example above) or the actual advertiser's website to view its privacy policy and learn how to stop receiving third-party advertisements.

Please note that SC Johnson has no control over this advertising network or the companies that belong to the network. 

**What laws govern the operation of SC Johnson's USA websites AND international transfers of personal information**

Our USA websites are governed and operated in accordance with the laws of the United States and are intended for the enjoyment of residents of the United States. 

Because we are an international business, the computer servers that support our USA websites and process your personal information may be located outside the country from which you accessed our websites, in a country that does not have the same privacy laws as your country of residence. Consequently, the personal information that you provide may be transmitted abroad. If so, we will handle your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice. 

Be aware that by using our websites or providing us with information, you are: (a) agreeing that our websites are subject to the laws of the United States, and (b) consenting to the collection, processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States or another country. 

**Information about SC Johnson's participation in US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor**
