# Privacy Policy – Zipcar

## R-E-S-P-E-C-T!

**Zipcar respects your privacy.** This Privacy Policy describes the personal information we collect from you and how we use that information. This Privacy Policy covers both our collection and use of information when you use zipcar.com and related websites, as well as the kinds of information we collect when you join Zipcar and use our services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to other internet sites even if accessed via our websites. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us in one of the ways provided below.

## What is personal information?

Personal information means information that identifies you as an individual, or that we can combine with readily available information to identify you as an individual.

## What personal information we collect and how we use it

The principle purposes for which we collect and store your personal and financial information are to process your application, allow you to reserve and use Zipcars, authorize payment, bill you, respond to your inquiries, improve our products and services and maintain your account with us.

**When you visit the Zipcar websites,** our servers automatically log certain information about your use of our websites, such as your IP address, your browser type, operating system, browser language and service provider. We also collect information about your activities on our websites, such as the pages you visit or the ads or links you click on. The first time you visit a Zipcar website, Zipcar assigns you a unique number, which is stored in one or more cookies on your computer's hard drive. These cookies help us distinguish new visitors from returning visitors and enable us to measure the effectiveness of content on the website and refine and tailor that content to suit our visitors' interests. If you have joined Zipcar or provided other personal information about yourself (for example, if you send us an email), your cookie ID can be associated with you personally. To learn more about cookies and how Zipcar customizes the content and offers for you, please see " **Advertising and Personalized Content** " below.

**Zipcar collects information that you voluntarily submit to us** , such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number, if you include that information in an email, or text message sent to us or that you tell us over the telephone, in an instant message or by other means. Your telephone calls and email correspondence with us may be recorded or monitored for quality control, training and similar purposes. By using these communication methods you are consenting to the recording or monitoring of your calls and emails with Zipcar.

**If you apply to join Zipcar** , we collect personal and financial information as you proceed through the stages of our online application, membership agreement and reservation process. In addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect your driver's license number and the jurisdiction in which you are registered and credit card or other payment information. We may also collect information such as your driving record from regulatory bodies where you live, and from third parties. This information is used to process your application and, if you are approved, for the purposes described below.

**If you join Zipcar and use our services** , we collect information about your reservations (dates, times, locations, etc.) and your use of the Zipcar service (return time, mileage, accidents, etc.). We use this information to bill you, respond to your inquiries, provide and improve our products and services and maintain your account with us, to personalize your Zipcar experience (i.e., by understanding your preferences), and to provide content and offers that we think may be of interest to you. To learn more about how Zipcar customizes the content and offers you please see "Advertising and Personalized Content" below.

**Zipcars may be equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) vehicle tracking technology.** GPS is a network of satellites that allows us to determine the location (latitude and longitude) of Zipcars. This information is transmitted to Zipcar and temporarily stored (including while it is hired to you). Zipcar uses this information for a variety of important purposes. For example, we use GPS data to help you find a car you have reserved, to provide roadside assistance when you need it, to ensure that a car is available at the place and time you have reserved, to alert us when a Zipcar is likely to be returned late and to locate lost or stolen Zipcars. We do not actively track or monitor vehicle location, and we do not store historical GPS data regarding vehicle location – we use GPS data only to determine the last reported location of Zipcars.

## Children's privacy

We do not knowingly solicit or collect individually identifying information from children under the age of 13.

## Where we hold personal information

Zipcar maintains servers within the European Union and in the United States of America. Please note that the laws governing the processing of personal information in the United States of America may not be as rigorous as they are in the United Kingdom or Canada. By joining Zipcar and using our services, you consent to the transfer of your personal and financial information outside of the European Economic Area and Canada, as applicable, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

## To what third parties might we transfer personal information?

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, Zipcar will not share your personal information with third parties outside the Zipcar group unless it is necessary to provide the Zipcar service, fulfill a transaction you have requested, or in other circumstances with your consent. We do however disclose your personal information within the Zipcar group and to contractors, advisors, consultants and service providers acting on our behalf or under our instructions, including for purposes relating to the operation, maintenance, administration, improvement, and oversight of our services, websites and advertising services, or to fulfill your requests for information or service. If you apply for Zipcar membership, some of the information you supply must necessarily be shared with regulatory bodies where you live and/or service providers we utilize to obtain your driving record from such regulatory bodies. We do not share your personal information with such regulatory bodies or service providers beyond what is necessary to approve your application. In addition, if you are associated or affiliated with another, primary account (for example, if you are an associate member or affiliated with a business's or university's account), the primary account holder or administrator of that account may have access to limited information regarding your use of our services.

We may disclose your personal information in connection with a corporate transaction, proceeding, or reorganization involving the business activities for which the information is maintained. In the event that ownership of Zipcar or its business was to change as a result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company, your personal information may be transferred. If such a transfer results in a material change in the way your personal information is used, we will provide notice about the choices you have to decline to permit such a transfer.

Zipcar may disclose your personal information, including location/GPS data, in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena) or requests from law enforcement authorities; in other circumstances in which Zipcar believes the website or the Zipcar service is being used in the commission of a crime; when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or another person; or when necessary to protect the rights or property of Zipcar or third parties.

Zipcar may also use third party ad network providers and other service providers to help present customized content and offers on our websites. These providers use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer to help present, better target, and measure the effectiveness of their content and advertisements, using data gathered over time and across their networks of web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audience. We may share certain non-personally identifiable information about you (such as age and zip code) with certain ad network and service providers to help them deliver more relevant content and advertisements through their networks. **The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by content and ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.**
