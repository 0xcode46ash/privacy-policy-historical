# Privacy Policy

**ZipDial Mobile Solutions Pvt. Ltd.**

ZipDial knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting ZipDial's web site [www.zipdial.com], submitting information or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.

**What does this privacy policy cover?**  
This Privacy Policy covers ZipDial's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that ZipDial gathers when you are accessing ZipDial's web site and when you use ZipDial's services. The types of Personal Information collected may include your full name, address, e-mail address, phone or other communication device number and other data related to your account (including contact lists and preferences). Also, this Policy covers ZipDial's treatment of any Personal Information that ZipDial's business partners share with ZipDial. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ZipDial does not own or control, or to individuals that ZipDial does not employ or manage.

**What personal information does ZipDial collect?**  
The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers. 

**Personal information you provide to us.**  
We may receive and store any information you enter on our web site or in connection with our services or that you provide to us in any other way. It is important to note that we only store personal information provided to use ZipDial services and not personal information related to services of other third parties. For example, if you link your mobile number to your Twitter account through ZipDial, we do not store your Twitter password, it is only used by Twitter to authorize a one-time linkage with ZipDial.   
The Personal Information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about the services. 

**Personal information collected automatically.**  
We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our web site or services. ZipDial may choose to automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. ZipDial may also choose to automatically collect information from your use of the services, including account activity (e.g. storage use, number of log-ins, number of calls, phone numbers dialled), data displayed and clicked on, and other usage information (e.g. the identity of your mobile operator, your mobile subscriber circle, subscription and response data while using ZipDial services). This type of data allows us to improve and personalize our services and content delivered to you. ZipDial will not share your mobile number, individual profile information or individual usage data with any third party. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate, not individual, information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site and mobile services and about the collective responses and opinions of our customers as expressed through use of our services. 

**Communications**  
We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail or text message if your computer or phone or other communication device supports this type of program. We may also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you have subscribed to any ZipDial services and you wish to discontinue receiving SMS communications for a particular ZipDial service, then you should dial the subscription number for that particular service. Dialing once activates your subscription, and dialing again initiates the unsubscribe activity; however, please be aware that you may not be able to use the services. 

**What About Cookies?**  
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site and on our service are visited and by how many people. ZipDial cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or to identify your screen name or e-mail address. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. 

**Will ZipDial share any of the personal information it receives?**  
Personal Information about our customers is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only with your consent or to business partners and affiliates as described below:

You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purpose.   
**Business partners:** In some cases we may enter into business partnership arrangements wherein we will share your information with such partner. Unless previously notified, all business partners will treat your information in the same manner as this policy.   
**Business Transfers:** In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if ZipDial, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of ZipDial may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.   
**Protection of ZipDial and Others:** We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with any law or regulation; enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of ZipDial, our employees, our customers, or others.   
Compliance with law enforcement and judicial authorities: We shall be bound to disclose Personal Information in response to a request/summons from a law enforcement authority; a court of law; or a quasi-judicial body.
