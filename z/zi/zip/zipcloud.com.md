By Using ZC Products or Services, you expressly consent to the collection, processing, and use of your Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy. 

Our Terms and Conditions of Use discuss how we handle, encrypt, and protect the data you choose to store on our servers (and any related data) ("Backup Data"), as well as other matters. All provisions of the Terms and Conditions of Use are incorporated into this document by reference. 

  * #### Definitions

All of the terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as are defined in our Terms and Conditions of Use. 

  * #### Why ZC Collects Personal Information

ZC collects your Personal Information at a variety of points, including when you place an order, download a new product or update, register a license, request services, store Backup Data, confer with one of our customer support technicians, or take part in other activities on our Website. During these interactions we will collect Personal Information relevant to your transaction with ZC, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, employment information, and credit card, banking or billing information, along with information about the ZC Products or Services you license, such as the activation code, date of purchase, and information relating to a support issue. ZC will use your Personal Information to send you messages through desktop alerts, SMS/Text messaging, email, etc. concerning updates to ZC Products or Services. Please be aware that if you choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, make ZC Products or Services available to you. 

  * #### Regarding Children

ZC Products or Services are not marketed to or intended for use by individuals who cannot legally bind a contract. Accordingly, ZC does not intentionally gather any Personal Information about visitors or customers who are under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18 or otherwise lack the capacity to enter into a binding contract, do not use our Website or services yourself. Please ask an adult to establish an account with us instead. 

  * #### Cookies and Other Technologies

ZC uses "cookies" and other technologies to collect data that enable us to better understand and improve the usability, performance and effectiveness of our Website. Cookies are files sent to your browser and stored on your computer. If you do not want ZC to send cookies to your browser, you can set your browser options to reject cookies or to notify you when a Website tries to put a cookie into your browser software. Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use some features of ZC Products or Services. 

ZC gathers general information about visits to our Website, the files you have marked for backup, the configuration of your computer and your computer’s interaction with ZC, and stores this information in log files. ZC uses this information to understand traffic and downloads on our Website, enabling us to improve the site, provide the best online experience possible, and improve our ability to serve our customers. 

To install ZC Products or Services on your computer, you must be an "Authorized Administrator." By installing ZC Products or Services on your computer, you grant ZC the right to back-up any and/or all of the files on the computer regardless of who might be the creator, originator, editor, or otherwise the owner of those files. You assume sole responsibility for ZC receiving access to and backing-up those files. 

  * #### Sharing Your Personal Information

ZC will not provide unaffiliated third parties with access to your email address or other contact information. ZC or the ZC Affiliates may, from time to time, share with you information about other products and services that we think you may find to be of interest. If you wish to change the types of communications you receive from us, you may do so by modifying your profile at www.MyPCBackup.com, by emailing your request to us at [support@zipcloud.com](mailto:support@zipcloud.com), or by clicking on an appropriate link in any ZC email communication to you. 

ZC may disclose your Personal Information to third parties if we believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with a law, regulation, or governmental or judicial warrant, rule, or order; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of ZC; (3) enforce the ZC Terms and Conditions of Use and/or this Privacy Policy. ZC may also provide access to your Backup Data to government authorities if ZC suspects or believes that the data contain child pornography or other prohibited data, or that the data or the ZC Products or Services are being used for illegal purposes. ZC will provide access to your Backup Data to your surviving spouse and/or your executor upon presentation of a death certificate and identification which ZC reasonably believes to be valid and sufficient, or in response to a court order, warrant, subpoena or other judicial or administrative legal process. 

  * #### How We Communicate with You

ZC may, from time to time, send you emails, or desktop alerts or other communications containing the following types of information: notifications of detected problems with your service; notifications concerning the expiration of your account; activity status reports; service and software upgrade notices; notices concerning new or related products or services from ZC or other providers, enhancements, and price changes, notifications regarding suspected unlawful or inappropriate use, and requests for feedback on your ZC Products or Services. 

  * #### Security for Your Personal Information

ZC has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your Personal Information in our customer database. Personal Information provided to ZC is stored in secure facilities with access restricted to authorized personnel only. Although we make good faith efforts to store the Personal Information we collect in a secure operating environment that is not accessible to unauthorized users, we cannot guarantee complete security. 

To provide secure credit card processing when ordering from us, orders placed on our Website are processed through a payment gateway which operates under its own privacy policy. If you choose to purchase or license ZC Products or Services online using a credit card, the credit card information is sent to ZC using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, an industry-standard method for protecting data as it travels over the Internet, or a similar encryption technology that may become accepted as an industry standard or better encryption method, in the future ("Transmission Encryption"). To learn more about our credit card processing vendors and their respective privacy and other policies (which are incorporated by reference into the ZC Privacy Policy and Terms or Use by reference) email us at [support@zipcloud.com](mailto:support@zipcloud.com). 

ZC encrypts the files that we process before they leave your computer. ZC uses SSL or similar Transmission Encryption technology before sending your files to our data centers. Your encrypted backup files transmitted to our servers are stored in facilities with access restricted to authorized personnel only. ZC does not encrypt the file names or file type information. 

By Using the ZC Product that permits you to download your backed up files to any computer that has a connection to the Internet you understand that ZC will be decrypting these files before they leave ZC’s servers and that once decrypted these files can be reviewed by anyone who may be able to access them. 

ZC will not decrypt your files unless i) it reasonably believes that it must do so to troubleshoot problems with the ZC Products or Services or ii) it reasonably believes it must do so in order to comply with a law, subpoena, warrant, order, or a certification requirement, such as the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 2703. 

However, if you elect to Use ZC Products or Services that permit you to access Backup Data from an Internet enabled computer other than by using ZC Software on your registered computer, then your Backup Data will be decrypted by ZC in its data center and sent to you in a decrypted form via public infrastructure. You election to use such products or services may make the contents of these files to accessible to individuals or entities other than you and those you intend. By using such products and services, you knowingly accept this risk. 

  * #### How You Can Access Or Correct Your Personal Information

You can access selected Personal Information that we collect online by selecting the "My Account" tab on our home page and logging in. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. You can correct factual errors in your Personal Information on our Web site or by sending a request (to [support@zipcloud.com](mailto:support@zipcloud.com)) that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. 

  * #### European Personal Identifiable Information

The Personal Information we collect from individuals or equipment located in the European Economic Area ("European Personal Information") may be processed on servers in the United States.

    * CHOICE. Where ZC collects Personal Information directly from individuals in the EEA, ZC will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their Personal Information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For Sensitive Personal Information, ZC will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. ZC will provide individuals with commercially reasonable mechanisms to exercise their choices. 
    * ONWARD TRANSFERS TO AGENTS. ZC will obtain assurances from its agents that they will safeguard Personal Information through measures consistent with this Privacy Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, the agent registering to participate in the Safe Harbor mechanism, or another method of assurance deemed adequate by the European Commission. Where ZC has knowledge that an agent is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner contrary to this Privacy Policy, ZC will take commercially reasonable steps to prevent or stop the unauthorized use or disclosure. 
    * SECURITY. ZC will take commercially reasonable steps to protect Personal Information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. 
    * DATA INTEGRITY. ZC will use Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. ZC will take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current to the extent appropriate for its intended use. 
    * ACCESS. Upon request, ZC will grant individuals commercially reasonable access to Personal Information that it holds about them. In addition, ZC will take commercially reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete.
