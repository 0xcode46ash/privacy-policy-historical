Privacy Policy

At Zip.ca we respect and are committed to protecting your privacy, and we support a general policy of openness about how we collect, use and disclose your personal information.

This Privacy Policy informs you how Zip.ca collects, uses and discloses the personal information that you provide to us through use of our website and subscription to our DVD rental services. By subscribing to the Zip.ca DVD rental service, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy.

This Privacy Policy also explains how you can contact us if you have a question about our Privacy Policy, want to change or update your personal information or change your preferences concerning our use and disclosure of your personal information.

We recommend that you take the time to read this Privacy Policy so that you understand how we handle and process your personal information. As we develop and expand our services, this Privacy Policy may also change. We will include a "last amended " date on the Policy as displayed on the website. We strongly encourage you to refer back to the Privacy Policy periodically. 

For the purpose of this Privacy Statement, "personal information" means information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization.

How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information   

Processing of Orders and Subscriptions

When you subscribe to the Zip.ca DVD rental service, we ask for your email address and a password, for your name, postal address, telephone number and a valid credit card number. We use this information to process your rental requests and to ship requested DVDs to you. We use your telephone number for the sole purpose of contacting you in the event of shipping or order-related issues, and not for marketing or other purposes. We request that you provide a valid credit card number during the Free Trial Subscription period in the event that DVDs shipped during this period are not returned and charges for unreturned DVDs assessed. If you are paying by credit card, we continue to use the credit card number provided by you initially for billing purposes should you not cancel and continue as a Zip.ca member. If you select the automatic debit payment option for your subscription, we will ask you for the name of your bank, your account number and other bank identifiers.

We use your email address to notify you that DVDs in your rental list have been shipped to you, to answer inquiries that you send to us, and to communicate with you when necessary concerning billing, the administration of your account and the processing of your rental requests. As these functions are necessary to the proper administration of your subscription account, we do not offer an opt-out from such email communication.

Rental History

We track and retain your order history so that you can access the DVDs you have rented previously, and to remove shipped titles from your rental list. You can access your order history in the Your Account section of the website. This information is available to you alone and is not disclosed to other users, members or third parties.

DVD Ratings and Recommendations

Our website contains a "Rating" feature where you can, at your option, rate any DVD in our library on a scale of 1 to 5. If you rate a movie you have rented, we use this information to personalize the Recommendations feature of the website that is accessible to you when you log in. If you do not wish to receive personalized recommendations, please do not use the "Ratings" feature. Subscribers who do not use the Ratings feature will receive standard Recommendations issued by Zip.ca.

Affiliate Program

Zip.ca also offers an Affiliate Program, where affiliate members direct customers to Zip.ca through links on their Web sites. We ask affiliate members for their site name (URL), mailing address, primary contact, pay-to address, technical contact, and other site-related information to determine whether a site will be included in our Affiliate Program. You can go to the Affiliate Program area for more details. The information collected from our affiliates is used strictly for that program; none of this information is used for general marketing purposes. In order to administer the Affiliate Program we log information from the URL of a referring website when members subscribe to Zip.ca. We do not use this information for any other purpose, nor do we disclose any Zip.ca member information to affiliate members.

Share With a Friend Feature

You can use the Share With a Friend feature on the Zip.ca website to inform others about our services or website. We provide an email transmission for you to send for this purpose. While we facilitate this email transmission, we do not retain any text or the email address(es) to which you send when using this feature. 

Email for Marketing Purposes

When you register with Zip.ca, we offer you an opportunity to opt-out of receiving email communications from us that inform you about new DVDs, promote new or additional services or contain special offers from Zip.ca and our corporate affiliates in the Internet services sector. If you do not opt-out, we will use your personal information for these purposes and may also disclose your email address and/or name to our corporate affiliates so that they can send you such information directly. To exercise the opt-out at any time, visit the Your Account section.

Rental and Subscription Services Analysis

Zip.ca may also generate aggregate information about rentals, requests for titles and use of the subscription services to assist it in assessing and improving the subscription service. Zip.ca does not use personal information in generating such analysis, nor does it relate this information to any individual member.

When We Disclose Your Personal Information

Zip.ca will not sell, license, trade or rent your personal information to or with unaffiliated third parties. Zip.ca will not otherwise disclose your personal information except as described below.

Zip.ca may also disclose personal information about its members to a third party if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order legally requires or authorizes us to do so, to enforce and protect the terms and conditions of our agreement(s) with you or the Terms of Use applicable to our website, or to collect on outstanding accounts. 

Zip.ca also reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal or financing of all or any portion of Zip.ca or of any of the business or assets or shares of Zip.ca, provided the third party represents that it will continue to use the information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with applicable privacy protection laws. 

Retention of Your Personal Information

We retain your rental history for the period that you remain a member, for the purposes described above. We do not retain this information once your subscription is terminated. We retain your contact account and shipping information for the periods required by applicable laws or limitation periods.

How We Protect Your Personal Information  

Zip.ca makes all commercially reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from loss, unauthorized access, misuse or theft. We use a secure server (SSL) and encrypt all transmissions of personal information by you. We limit access to your account information with login and password protection features. We encourage you to change your password regularly and to provide us with accurate information through the Your Account section feature.

Only those Zip.ca employees who have a legitimate business purpose for accessing the personal information collected by us are authorized to do so. Unauthorized access to or use of personal information by an employee is prohibited and constitutes grounds for disciplinary action. In addition, our management systems are configured so as to block or restrict employee access from those without access privileges.

This website may offer links to other third party websites. You should be aware that operators of linked websites may also collect your personal information (including information generated through the use of cookies) when you link to their websites. Zip.ca is not responsible for how such third parties collect, use or disclose your personal information, so it is important to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of these websites before providing your personal information on those sites.
