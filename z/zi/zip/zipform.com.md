# ZIPLOGIX PRIVACY AND SECURITY STATEMENT

ZIPLOGIX PRIVACY AND SECURITY STATEMENT
Effective May 21, 2012.
This document was previously updated October 26, 2011.
zipLogix (“we” “us” or “our”) appreciates your interest in and use of our products and services. The
protection of your privacy and the security of our products and services are important to us. We have
created this Privacy and Security Statement (“Statement”) to demonstrate our firm commitment to
privacy and so that you will be aware of the uses made of information that may be generated through
your use of our website and products and services. Please take a few minutes to read the complete
Statement.
TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Personal Information
Personal information is information that permits direct association with a specific individual.
Personal information, such as your name, broker affiliation, mailing address, email address, and
phone number is either requested or required at different points during your use of our website or
products and services to complete your order, create your account and/or ensure that you are
authorized to use certain intellectual property (e.g., form libraries in zipForm®) that may be licensed
to us. Depending upon the libraries to which you request access, your current association
membership status or broker affiliation may be verified by asking you to log into other websites. You
may also enter personal information relating to yourself or others into certain fields when you use our
products and services in your real estate business. For example, you may enter personal information
relating to a client, customer, purchaser or seller into a form in zipForm® during a real estate
transaction.
Non-Personal Information
We also collect non-personal information. Non personal information is information that does not
permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use and disclose non-personal
information for any purpose except as prohibited by law. For example, we may collect information
relating to your activities on our website, your use of our products and services and information you
enter into certain fields within our products such as a zip code. If we combine your non-personal
information with your personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal
information.
Cookies and Other Technologies
Our website and some of our online products and services, email messages and advertisements may
use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of our website, products and
services. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal
information, except when combined with personal information or as provided by law. We use
cookies and other technologies to verify user information, to make your use of our website, products
and services more convenient and to assist in understanding your use of our website, products and
services. Most internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you may set your
browser so that it refuses cookies or alerts you when cookies are being created on your hard drive.


You should be aware that by not accepting cookies you may impair your ability to use certain
portions of our website, products and services.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION
Personal Information
Primarily, we store and use personal information to make our products and services easier for you to
use by not making you enter personal information more than once, help manage your subscription,
provide technical administration and support for you and add security to our products by printing
your name, and your broker’s name and address, on your transaction forms in zipForm®. We also
store and use personal information to collect information about your zipLogix product and service
usage for auditing and data analysis purposes. This helps us determine how to best improve our
products and services and what other products and services may be valuable or of interest to you.
Non-Personal Information
We gather non-personal information to understand and analyze trends in your use of our website,
products and services, to gather information about our user base and the real estate industry as a
whole, to administer our website, products and services and to help us determine how to improve our
products, services and advertising. We may store and use non-personal information to create, use,
license and sell general analytic databases that may provide insight into subjects including, but not
limited to, real estate market practices, industry trends and general economic conditions. We may
also use this information in our marketing and advertising services, in our creation of new products
and services and for our internal business purposes.
DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES
We occasionally hire other companies to provide services on our behalf, including development,
testing, hosting, and answering customer questions about our products or services. We will provide to
those companies only the personal information they need to deliver support to us, and we prohibit
them from using that information for any other purpose. We may also provide your personal
information, but not the non-public personal information you enter into zipLogix products and
services related to your clients and customers, to our parent company and its subsidiaries or to third
parties that we feel offer other products or services that may be valuable or interesting to you.
Finally, we may provide non-personal information to third parties for general analytic purposes
related to real estate market practices, industry trends and general economic conditions.
We will disclose personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good
faith belief that such action is necessary to protect and defend the rights or property of zipLogix.
When you subscribe or otherwise give us personal information, we do not share that information with
third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions listed above.
SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
For website security purposes and to ensure that our products and services remain available to all
users, our servers employ industry-standard methods to monitor network traffic to identify
unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized
attempts to upload information or change information on our servers are strictly prohibited and may


be punishable by law, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National
Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996. We use technical and organizational security
measures in order to protect the data we have under our control against loss, misuse, unauthorized
access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Inside the company, data is stored in password-
controlled servers with limited access.
You also have a significant role in protecting your information. Do not share your password or allow
others to use your account. It is good practice for you to change your password regularly.
REVIEW/CORRECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We market and sell several products and services. Our products and services that collect and use
personal information provide, where appropriate, a method that allows you to inspect whether your
personal information is correct and current. To reduce the possibility that some subscribers may
attempt to share their access to and use of our products and services with non-subscribers, some of
your information - once it is entered - may not be directly changeable by you.
If you wish to review, correct or update any personal information about you collected through our
website or through your use of our products and services, please click on SALES, or write us at:
zipLogix LLC, 18070 15 Mile Road, Fraser, Michigan 48026.

third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please click on OPT OUT, or write us at: zipLogix,

CHANGES TO THIS STATEMENT
We reserve the right to alter this Statement as our business needs require. In the event we make any
material changes to this Statement, we will notify you by updating the Statement’s effective date and
indicating the previous effective date. As you use our website, products and services, we encourage
you to periodically check back with this Statement for changes that we may make. Your continued
