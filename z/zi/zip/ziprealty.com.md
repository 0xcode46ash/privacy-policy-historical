Your Password should never be shared with anyone.

**What general information is collected and how it is used.**

When you visit zipRealty, our computer system, like most, will automatically log some basic information about you and your computer, including, but not limited to, your IP address, operating system and browser software. We use this information for routine maintenance and to gather broad demographic information to help us decide how better to implement our web site.

We use cookies. Cookies are used to store a session ID for tracking users as they move through the web site after logging on. The cookies are not linked to personally identifiable information. If a user does not accept cookies, they will not be able to register on our web site or re-log in as a registered user.

**With whom personally identifiable information is shared.**

We recognize that the information we collect from you may, in itself, or when tied together with other information, identify you as a specific individual. Your account information and personal data is maintained by zipRealty in order to fulfill our legal and regulatory requirements and to provide you with the information, products and services you have requested. As a general rule, zipRealty will not disclose your personal information to any third party except with your permission or under special circumstances, as discussed below.

zipRealty will disclose to interested parties information pertaining to the sale of a house listed in our database. This information will be posted on our web site and in the local Multiple Listing Service (MLS) for the purpose of marketing the home to the greatest number of potential buyers.

By requesting information or services from zipRealty, you give zipRealty permission to transfer your information, as necessary, to the appropriate parties, such as the title insurer, loan underwriter, appraiser, or inspector you select, so that they can fulfill your request and provide you with the services you require. All Online Agents are employees of zipRealty. All personally identifiable information you provide to zipRealty will be made available to your Online Agent. Generally, your Online Agent will coordinate the disclosure of your information to third parties. This will be done in much the same way as a traditional Real Estate Agent shares information with third parties. For example, your Online Agent may disclose your name and the address of the property you want to purchase to a building inspector when you request our assistance in arranging an inspection of the property. Your Online Agent will also share certain information with zipRealty Field Service Agents who will assist you in viewing properties.

The various lending institutions, title companies and other service providers involved in your real estate transaction may each have their own privacy policies governing how they handle your personally identifiable information. We endeavor to review these other policies in order to ensure that the philosophies and values of our affiliates are in alignment with our own. However, zipRealty accepts no responsibility or liability for third party privacy policies or the actions of any third party with respect to your personally identifiable information. 

zipRealty does conduct research on our users' demographics, interests and behavior based on the information provided by the user and from our server log files. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis only. For example, we may review how many users are women, or the average price range of our users. zipRealty may share this aggregated data with our business affiliates or, if required by law, any government agency. However, we will not sell or lease personally identifying information to any third party.

If you came to our website through a link on eBay's website ("eBay Referred Users"), zipRealty may provide eBay reasonably requested aggregated and personally identifiable data. zipRealty has also agreed to provide eBay reasonable access to its database of eBay Referred Users in order to support communication with and surveys of the eBay Referred Users.

zipRealty may disclose personally identifiable information in certain circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to contact, identify or bring legal action against someone who may be intentionally or unintentionally causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, our users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose personally identifiable information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative or other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain and improve our products and services.

Our web site provides links to other web sites. Please be aware that when you click on one of these links, you are going to another web site even though the zipRealty logo, banner, or tool bar may still be visible. Information you enter on these other web sites is being collected by that site, not zipRealty. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their privacy policy may differ from ours.

**User choices regarding collection and use of information.**

On occasion, we may use your e-mail address to send you communications with information about your transaction, valuable tips, or services and product information that we believe may be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive such communications from zipRealty, simply contact us at [team@zipRealty.](mailto:team@zipRealty.com)

You are free to not provide any of the information requested on the zipRealty web site However, certain information may be necessary or required by law in order for you to obtain some zipRealty services. Therefore, if you choose not to provide the requested information you may not be able to access certain zipRealty services.

Your zipRealty account can be deleted or de-activated at any time by contacting [team@zipRealty.com](mailto:team@ziprealty.com) **.** However, you will not be able to access any of the products and services offered by zipRealty if you choose to delete your account. Please note that we may be required by law to retain certain personally identifiable or demographic information about you even if you choose to delete your account. For example, some loan programs are governed by state and federal law and require the disclosure and retention of certain information regarding loan applicants. However, we will only retain or use such information as is required by law. Please note that zipRealty will never share or sell your information.

**User access and ability to update information.**

You may edit your preferences and the information you have provided at any time by sending e-mail to [team@zipRealty.com](mailto:team@ziprealty.com) or mail to zipRealty, Inc., 2000 Powell Street, Suite 1555, Emeryville, CA 94608. You may also visit www.zipRealty.com. You will need your Login ID and Password to access your account information online. If you have lost your password, you may request a new one by sending an e-mail to [team@zipRealty.com](mailto:team@ziprealty.com) **.** You may also contact your Online Agent to edit the information you provide to zipRealty.

**Security measures used to protect personally identifiable information.**

We restrict access to the zipRealty server and the personal information we store there by using a log-in process. When you enter the zipHomeManager area of the web site, which is designed for account holders only, you are required to provide your selected Login ID and Password. Other than our System Administrator and your Online Agent, only **you** have access to your account. Your password should never be shared with anyone. zipRealty will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or e-mail. 

E-mail is an important communication channel for our online customers. E-mail sent to Online Agents, Buyers or Sellers are carefully routed to the intended party. Unfortunately, no e-mail transmission over the Internet is guaranteed secure. While we strive to protect your information, zipRealty cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us from our online products and services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our system. 

Finally, we store all data on our system in a password protected database system, which is protected by our corporate firewall.

If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, or privacy issues in general, please feel free to contact us.
