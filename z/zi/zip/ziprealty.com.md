# Homes for Sale, MLS Listings Search, Real Estate Agents -- ZipRealty

Last updated: February 19, 2014 

ZipRealty Inc.'s ("ZipRealty" or "we") Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect, use, and share information provided by users to ZipRealty via the ZipRealty website (defined to include web, mobile, or otherwise) (the "Site") and mobile applications (the Site, mobile applications and the services we offer via the Site, collectively the "Services"). This Privacy Policy doesn't apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. 

**By registering on or using the Site, you are acknowledging and accepting this Privacy Policy.** We may from time-to-time, modify and revise this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we'll notify you of such changes by posting them on the Services, and we'll indicate the date of last revision. **Your continued use of the Services after changes have been posted to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.**

**_The Information We Collect_**

**Account Information.** Personal Information is information that others can use to identify, locate, or contact you, including but limited to, your name, email address, postal address, phone number, and, to the extent such comments include personally identifiable information, comments you make to forums and blogs available on the Site (collectively, "Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII"). When you register and create an account on our Services ("Account"), use the Services or contact ZipRealty, we may collect certain PII from you. We may also collect certain information that is not PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you, including, without limitation, information about whether you plan on buying and/or selling real estate, home search criteria, information about financing for the purchase of real estate and other information related to the sale and/or purchase of real estate. ZipRealty does not request or collect social security numbers, credit card numbers, or driverâ€™s license numbers. If you register or log on to the Site through Facebook, you may have to provide use with your username so that your identity can be authenticated by your Facebook account. When the authentication is complete, we'll be able to link your Account with your Facebook account and access certain PII, including your name, email address, profile picture, gender, user ID, list of friends and any other information that you have made publicly available on Facebook. We don't receive or store passwords for your Facebook account. Please refer to Facebook's privacy settings to determine how you may adjust the permissions and manage the interactivity between ZipRealty and Facebook. 

**Information Related to the Use of the Services.** ZipRealty's servers automatically record information sent by your browser or created by your use of the Services, regardless of whether you are an Account holder or a visitor (either, a "User"). Such information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users' needs and preferences. We may use a person's IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used. 

**Information Collected Using Cookies.** A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. When you access our Services, ZipRealty sends one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identifies your Internet browser. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you've logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. We use cookies to collect, store and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the Services. If you are an Account holder, we will use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most websites automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options by adjusting its privacy and security settings to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Browsers are different, so refer to instructions related to your browser to learn about cookie-related and other privacy and security settings that may be available. Please note, however, that if you don't accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own cookies on your computer. You acknowledge that ZipRealty has no control over the placement of cookies by such third-party services providers. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties. 

**Location Information.** In some cases, we collect information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. 

**Device Identification Information.** In some cases, we may assign an identification number to your device ("Device ID Number"). Device ID Numbers are not linked to any PII. We may use such device identification information to improve and personalize our Services for you. 

**Information from Your Communications.** When you send email or other communication to ZipRealty, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Services. 

**_How We Use Information_**

Depending on your use of the Services, we may use your PII for the following purposes:

  * To facilitate all aspects of the sale and/or purchase (or potential sale and/or purchase) of real estate.

In the future, we may sell some or all or our assets. 

**_Sharing Of Information_**

We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:

ZipRealty may disclose your PII: (i) to another entity that we engage as a third-party services provider for purposes of outsourcing one or more of the functions described in the previous "How We Use Information" section; (ii) to confirm or update information provided by you; (iii) to inform you of important information; (iv) in connection with a business transaction as described below in the "Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions" section; (v) with other companies for the purposes of marketing products to you after obtaining your consent; and/or (vi) as otherwise authorized by you. 

**Information Shared Based on your Opt-In.** ZipRealty may provide you with opportunities to opt-in to share certain information with ZipRealty and/or third parties in exchange for certain information to be provided by ZipRealty and/or a third party ("ZipRealty Information") to you. For example, our Site may have prompts asking you if you would like to receive updates regarding mortgage rates or other similar types of products/services relating to real estate. If you opt-into receiving such information, you may be asked to provide some information in order to receive ZipRealty Information. You may at any point withdraw your consent to share information with ZipRealty or third parties by sending an email with the subject "Do Not Share Information" to [privacy@ziprealty.com](mailto:privacy@ziprealty.com). Additionally, if you wish to opt out of emails received directly from third parties, you can follow the opt-out instructions in the emails they send you. ZipRealty will stop sharing your information within ten (10) days after receiving your request; provided, however, that information shared prior to that time will remain in the possession of ZipRealty or third parties and may continue to be used consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

**Information Shared in Connection with Real Estate Transactions.** ZipRealty may share your PII with third parties involved with your sale and/or purchase (or potential sale and/or purchase) of real estate. These third parties include, but are not limited to, third-party real estate agents and brokers, insurance providers, lenders, appraisers, home warranty providers, or inspectors. 

**Information You Share with Third Parties.** In connection with your real-estate transactions you may choose to work with third parties who are not affiliated with or related to ZipRealty, including without limitation lending institutions, title companies, insurers, appraisers, home warranty companies, real-estate agents, real-estate brokers and other service providers. These third parties may each have their own privacy policies governing how they handle your PII. ZipRealty has no responsibility or liability for third-party privacy policies or the actions of any third party with respect to your PII. 

**Information Disclosed for Protective Purposes.** We may also share your information (including PII) in response to a subpoena, legal order or official request of government and law enforcement officials, when, in our sole discretion, we believe you have acted in violation of the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/footer_pages/terms_of_use.jsp), or when we believe that doing so may protect our safety, your safety or the safety of others. 

**Sharing De-identified Information Shared with Third Parties.** We may share freely with any other party and for any reason information that is de-identified (for example, including, but not limited to any information stripped of information that could be used to identify you and/or hashing). This information is usually aggregated (i.e., combined with information from many other users), and may include information such as Site traffic patterns, trends, demographics, search patterns and other information. 

**Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions.** In the future, we may sell some or all or our assets. In such transactions, customer information (including PII) generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event of a sale of our assets including our database, customer information (including PII), will be transferred. Such a transfer may also occur if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy or are acquired in a transaction such as an acquisition or merger. 

**_Pre-Populated Accounts_**

We may collect information about you, including but not limited to, your name and email address, from ZipRealty agents or other third-party real-estate agents (each, an "Agent") whom you have previously contacted or with whom you have an established relationship ("Agent Information").

If you consent to this and provide Agent Information to an Agent, you will be notified via email that a ZipRealty account has been created on your behalf. If you choose to finalize the creation of an account, you will also be instructed to review and accept ZipRealty's Terms of Use and to review this Privacy Policy. You may choose not to finalize the creation of an account and may opt-out of all future communications from ZipRealty by following the instructions in the account creation notification or by contacting us at [privacy@ziprealty.com](mailto:privacy@ziprealty.com).
