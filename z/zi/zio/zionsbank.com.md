# Zions Bank: Privacy Policy

| 

Privacy is one of the most important services we provide our customers. The safeguarding of your information is a priority to us. This is true whether we are working with networks, paper files or computers. We look for ways to increase the security of your information that you entrust with us. As we do this, we also intend to provide the best possible financial products and services for your needs. We want to tell you more about how we protect your information and encourage you to read the following. If you have any questions, please contact your local branch or office location.

This Customer Privacy Policy only applies to individuals and families. It does not apply to any other type of client, for example businesses or corporations.

Customer Information We Collect  
We refer in this policy several times to "customer information." This means the data you give us to open various accounts at your request, such as name, address, Social Security number, telephone number, income and asset information. It also includes your experience with Zions Bank and our affiliates regarding your accounts, loans, and other banking services. Additionally, "customer information" includes information that was gathered via credit reporting bureaus, identity and check review agencies, and the like. 

What We Do With This Information  
Zions Bank uses your customer information to provide the products and services you request. We also use your customer information to provide products and services from our affiliates and various third parties as permitted by law. 

Our affiliates include banks, insurers, financial advisors and various electronic companies. We are allowed to share certain credit information with our affiliates, such as account history and customer experience (i.e., experience information.) Additional non-experience information about you can be shared with our affiliates unless you tell us otherwise. 

We may also use companies that are not our affiliates to perform services on our behalf. Such companies may be given customer information to enable them to perform these services. All companies hired to perform services on our behalf are prohibited from disclosing or using the information in any manner other than to provide the products and services requested by our customers. Examples of these companies include ATM switchers, data processors and check printing companies. 

At times we become aware of companies that offer products and services that may be of interest to you. If so, we may share your customer information, including transaction experience with these companies for purposes of marketing their products or services to you. 

Information Security  
Only employees who need access to customer information to perform their jobs are authorized to access customer information. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural security measures to safeguard information. 

E-mail Offers  
We may send you e-mail offers for our products and services, or those of our affiliates and other companies we work with. We don't share e-mail addresses with other companies for them to market their own products and services to you. Included with each e-mail are directions you can follow to discontinue any further e-mail offers from us. 

For Vermont Customers Only  
If any of your accounts with Zions Bank or our affiliates has a Vermont billing address, we will automatically treat your account as if you had checked boxes (1) and (4) on the attached My Privacy Choices form. If you want to select choices (2) and/or (3), please call our Customer Service toll-free line at **1-866-299-3338** between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm (Mountain Time) Monday through Saturday, or return the complete form to the address indicated in the "Your Choices" section. 

Former Customers of Zions Bank  
Zions Bank provides the same privacy services for customer information provided by applicants and former customers as it provides for existing customers. 

Your Choices  
Zions Bank offers a wide range of financial products and services to help you meet your needs and achieve your financial goals. We recognize, however, that you may want to choose how we contact you. If you have already talked with one of Customer Service Representatives and explained your choices, you do not need to call or send us anything. We will continue to honor your choices. 

If you have not already contacted Customer Service or if you want to change your choices, you can notify us by calling our Customer Service toll-free line at **1-866-299-3338** between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm (Mountain Time) Monday through Saturday.
