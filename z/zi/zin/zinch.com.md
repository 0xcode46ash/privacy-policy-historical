We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the other websites to which you choose to link from Zinch.com, including the Zinch Sites, so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.

High school students participate in Zinch voluntarily. Participation in this website enables students to receive information which is related to their educational needs and helps them plan for the future. The most important benefit of participating in Zinch is the information students and their families will receive from colleges and universities. Zinch also uses student data for research purposes to enable colleges, universities and other educational institutions to have a greater understanding of the current pool of potential applicants.

Zinch allows full access to our online information free of charge when users of Zinch.com (“Users”) register with Zinch through our Zinch.com service. This service allows prospective students to create profiles on our servers. Data collected can then be accessed and purchased by educational institutions such as, but not limited to, universities and colleges.

 **Cookies**

We use cookie technology within Zinch.com. We use cookies for remembering User names and passwords and for tracking click streams.

Cookies cannot obtain personally identifiable information such as your e-mail address, or any other information stored on your hard drive. Cookies are pieces of data normally stored by your browser, and you can quite easily prevent cookie data from being sent by adjusting your browser settings; however Zinch.com will not function properly if Cookies are not enabled. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page.

 **Information Protection and Security**

When you submit your information to Zinch, whether it be your name, address, email or phone number, we do our utmost to ensure that information is protected against loss, misuse, alteration, destruction or unauthorized access. Zinch uses standard encryption tools such as SSL (Secure Socket Layer) to help protect your personal information and to keep information collected secure.

Encryption can be used after your data has left your internal system. Encryption renders your data unreadable using a mathematical formula known as the key. Your data is turned back into readable form, i.e. deciphered, by applying the correct key.

Due to the nature of this technology, there is always a remote danger of information interception no matter what barriers are in place.

Our system does provide for profiles to be sent via un-encrypted email, and may be susceptible to intercept at this point. 

Employees within Zinch with access to your information provided are instructed to utilize such information only in adherence to this Privacy Policy. Employees who utilize information for any reason other than the reasons stated within this Privacy Policy may be subject to reprimand or even legal proceedings.

Third parties which access your data are instructed and agree to utilize such information only in adherence to this Privacy Policy; however Zinch is not responsible for the actions of third parties.
