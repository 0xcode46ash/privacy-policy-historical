# Zing Education - US Education Sites

We take the privacy concerns of our users very seriously. We strive to ensure that businesses and their websites are fairly and accurately represented on this website. 

As the listings shown on this website come from a number of sources, we understand that there may be times when businesses or websites that are listed here may wish for their details to be changed or even removed completely. Should that be the case, authorised representatives of websites may supply their updated details via the "Update these details" button on their listing page or may [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20081222080337id_/http%3A//www.zingeducation-us.com/ContactUs.aspx) directly should they wish their listing be removed. We will act promptly to make sure that the changes are made as quickly as possible. In the case of a listing removal request, we will also ensure that relevant search engines (eg. Google) are asked to remove the listing page from their cache. 

We will never display personal information about a website's authorised representative(s). Authorised representative(s) of websites may supply their name and contact details to us to assist us in maintaining a business relationship with them, however such details will be held in strict confidence and will never be displayed on this website, nor passed onto any third party. The only exception to this may be if the authorised representative(s) place such personal information within the website description section of their listing, in which case it will be displayed on this site. 

Users who list their business or website on this site are not obliged to provide their email address. If an email address is suppled, we will never pass that email address on to any third party. We also will not use it to send you marketing and/or advertising material, unless such material is required as part of the normal business relationship between a user and us. 

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that any information we collect is stored in a secure manner and protected from unauthorised access. 

Should you have any enquiries about this Privacy Statement, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20081222080337id_/http%3A//www.zingeducation-us.com/ContactUs.aspx).
