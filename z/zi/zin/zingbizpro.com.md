# Privacy Policy

ZingBizPro.com (“ **ZingBizPro.com** ” or “ **Site** ”) is owned by Zing, LLC (“ **Company** ” or “ **we** ” or “ **us** ”), a Florida Limited Liability Corporation, based in the State of Florida. Our mission is to help you connect with other people on personal and professional levels. We work to fulfill this mission by helping you, your connections, and all members of ZingBizPro.com to meet, have fun, exchange ideas, learn, make deals, find opportunities or employees, work, and make decisions in a network of trusted relationships and groups. Therefore, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors, users and subscribers (individually and collectively, “ **you** ” or “ **Members** ”), and we have created ZingBizPro.com’s Privacy Policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ” or “ **Policy** ”) to demonstrate our commitment. 

Being a Member means sharing information about you with other people, communicating with them on personal or professional levels. But, the amount and type of information you decide to share, and with whom you share it, is up to you. We do not release or share personally identifiable information about our Members without their permission. 

Please note that we review and modify our privacy practices from time to time and those practices are subject to change. We encourage you to visit this page frequently to stay informed. We will notify our Members, through their last known email address on file with ZingBizPro.com, of any material changes to our Privacy Policy.

Changes to this Policy may affect our use of the information that you have provided to us prior to our notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your information, you must notify us that you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your information, or deactivate your account immediately upon learning of such changes. The changes to our Privacy Policy become effective at the moment they are posted on the Site. If you continue using your Services after any changes to our Privacy Policy have become effective, we will deem your continuous use of this Site or any of its Content to represent your consent to such changes and agreement to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.

  2. _**Information We Collect**_ **.** When you become a Member or when you contact us, and at other times, such as when paying Subscriber’s fee, we will collect ''personally identifiable'' information and ''non-personally identifiable'' information from you. Only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be eligible to utilize our Services.

    1. **Personally Identifiable Information.** ''Personally identifiable'' information is information that we collect from you such as your name, employer, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address. As a Subscriber, your personal information will include billing information such as postal address and a credit card number. Unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal information, is a violation of this Privacy Policy, and is strictly prohibited.

We use your information for registration and customer service, such as to provide you with information you may request, and to send you our e-mail publication, or other correspondence or information that we think may be of interest to you, and to contact you regarding your account with us. We may also use the information that you provide to communicate information about new products and services. We also use your information for internal research purposes. This allows us to better understand your needs and to provide you with better service. 

You have the ability to change or correct certain information in our records, such as contact information, by signing into your account and going to your profile page. You also can deactivate your account with ZingBizPro.com. After the deactivation of your account, we will remove your name and other personally-identifiable information from our publicly-viewable database. However, your personal information will be stored in our internal, non-publicly available database for the period of twenty-four (24) months for the purpose of averting account fraud. The stored information will not be shared with the public and will be used internally only, within the Company, as a check mechanism that prevents the same person from creating two separate accounts. If you have any questions about correcting or changing your personal information, or account deactivation, please contact us by sending an email to _[privacy@ZingBizPro.com](mailto:privacy@ZingSocial.com)_ or by writing to the following address: ZingBizPro.com, 500 64th Street S, Saint Petersburg, Florida 33707, U.S.A. 

We do not collect any personally-identifiable information from you unless you knowingly and willingly provide it to us. 

    2. **Non-Personally Identifiable Information.** ''Non-personally'' identifiable information is information that we collect from you that cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as your site-browsing patterns or demographic information.

We collect non-personally identifiable information to help us, among other things, to monitor our internal operation. When visitors come to our Site, we may collect and aggregate non-personally identifiable information, indicating such information as the pages that they visited the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks they clicked. We, sometimes, use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of the Site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze how visitors and Members use and navigate our Site, as well as to offer you products, programs, or Services

Collecting non-personally identifiable information involves the logging of an Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, a numerical label that is assigned to the computer, which you have used to log into our Site. IP address does not personally identify the visitor because it only provides the geographic location of the visitor’s point of connectivity and his or her Internet Service Provider.

We also collect non-personally identifiable information from you by tracking your use of the Site, often through the use of cookies. A ''cookie'' is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server that you access and which is stored on your computer's hard drive. This data file may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that a web site may use to track certain things. Once you have logged in, cookies will provide information to the Site so that you will not have to re-enter your password each time that you access a password-protected area of this Site. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information. However, once you choose to furnish the Site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data, stored in the cookie. 

Preference and options configurations in your browser determine if and how a cookie will be accepted. You can change those configurations on your computer if you desire. You can do this through settings in your web browser (like Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox or Opera). Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s “Help” menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. By changing your preferences, you can choose to accept all cookies, or have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you will be required to re-enter your information frequently when you navigate our Site, or the Site may not work for you at all.

As part of their basic functionality, most browsers provide information about the operating system (e.g., Windows Vista or Mac OS X), web browser version (e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape), and Internet Protocol address of the computer station they are running on and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., Verizon, AT&T). This information is available to every website, which a user visits. 



  3. _**How We Use Your Information**_

    1. **Registration; Creation of an Account.** When you join ZingBizPro.com, you will register on our Site by providing your actual name, valid physical mailing address, valid return email, your date of birth and gender. When you register as a business, we will ask you to provide the name of the business, a valid email address, associated with this business, mailing address, the type of business, and your checking account or a credit card number. The name on the checking account or on the credit card must match the name of the business entity which you used to register on our Site.

We advise you to be cautious when you post any personal information in newsgroups, chat rooms, or other public forums because this information will be open to all participants of the public forums. 



  4. _**How We Share Information With Others**_

    1. **All Accounts.** We may hire agents and contractors to perform services on our behalf including, without limitation, facilitating some aspects of our web site, sending e-mail to you, and handling our billings, collections and renewals. These other companies may be supplied with or have access to your personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf.

Agents and contractors of the Company who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the Services that they are performing for the Company and as otherwise required by law.

We may disclose and use your information in special circumstances when we believe in good faith that such disclosures: (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena; or (b) will help to enforce our agreements with you; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of this Site, our Company, and/or third parties, including the safety and security of property that belongs to the Company or third parties.

In the event that all of our business assets are transferred to or acquired by another company, your information may be one of the transferred assets.

    2. **Links.** This Site may contain links to other sites that may have information practices dissimilar to ours. We are not responsible or liable for the information collection practices or content of such linked sites. You should consult the other sites' privacy policies, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

    3. **Opt-Out Option.** You have the opportunity, before the time your personal, non-public information is initially disclosed to a non-affiliated third party, to direct us that such information not be disclosed to such third party. We will notify you at the last email address that you have provided to us about our intent to disclose your personal, non-public information with a non-affiliated third party. You will have five (5) business days to notify us that you would like to “opt-out” from the disclosure by sending your request to _[opt@ZingBizPro.com](mailto:opt@ZingSocial.com)_ , with “Opt-Out” as a subject line. If we receive your request in a timely fashion, within five (5) business days, we will honor it. However, if you fail to exercise your “opt-out” option within five (5) business days after receiving our notification of intent, we will interpret your silence as consent to the disclosure.

This subsection shall not prevent us from providing nonpublic personal information to a non-affiliated third party to perform services or functions on our behalf, including marketing of our services or products, or services or products offered pursuant to joint agreement(s) between us and the non-affiliated third party, when we enter into a contractual agreement with the third party that requires the third party to maintain the confidentiality of such information.

    4. **Advertising and Web Beacons.** To support the services we provide to our users, as well as provide a more relevant and useful experience for our users, we serve our own ads and also allow third party advertisements on the site. These advertisements are targeted and served to Members, by both ZingBizPro.com and other companies, called ad networks. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.

Advertisements on the Site may target Members, who fit a certain general profile category (e.g., “product managers in Florida”) or may be based on anonymous information inferred from a Member’s profile (e.g., industry, compensation bracket, gender, age, ethnic origin, nationality, religion, or other aspects of your life) in addition to the Member’s use of our Site. The Company does not provide personally identifiable information to any third party ad network.

To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may include a file, called a web beacon, from an ad network within pages served by the Company. The web beacon allows the ad network to provide non-personally identifiable, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers. Web beacons also enable the ad networks to serve ads to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

You may opt-out of use of web beacons in ZingBizPro.com pages that you view and of placement of a cookie by ad networks in your browser. To opt-out, please, email to _[optout@ZingBizPro.com](mailto:opt@ZingSocial.com)_. If you opt-out you may lose certain functionality of our services, as well as the potential benefit of receiving ads that are targeted to your interests which, in turn, may limit your ability to fully realize the benefits of our Services to build and leverage your professional network.

    5. **ZingBizPro.com’s Message Boards**. If you provide any testimonials about the ZingBizPro.com Services or place advertisements through the Site’s Message Boards, we may post those testimonials and examples of advertisements you place in connection with our promotion of these services to third parties. Testimonials and advertisements may include your name and other personal information that you have provided. 

    6. **Security.** While at ZingBizPro.com, your information can be accessed through your username and password or, if you selected the ''auto login'' feature, you will be able to log into your account through the unique identifier stored on your computer. 

The personally identifiable information that we collect about you is stored in limited access servers, password protected and accessible by only a limited number of our personnel. We will maintain additional safeguards to protect the security of your personally identifiable information. Although we take these measures to protect the security of your information, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us. You transmit such information at your own risk and agree that we will not be liable for any damages or injury that may result from unauthorized access to or use of your information. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
