ZDNet Australia collects personal information about our users only during voluntary registration for ZDNet services, from our use of "cookie" technology as you use the site and during entry into a ZDNet contest.

ZDNet Australia respects your right to privacy. As part of the registration process, we give you the opportunity to decline to receive any mailings from either ZDNet Australia, our parent company ZD APN Partners or other parties to whom ZDNet may provide such information.

The data we collect from cookies is used only in the aggregate to give us demographic information about the entire ZDNet Australia audience in order to improve our service. The personal information you provide - name, address, etc. -- allows us to inform you about updates to the service and to notify you of products and services of ZDNet Australia and its affiliates that we believe may be of interest to you. We also share aggregate information -- not individual data --with our advertisers to help them better understand our services and to monitor the reach of their advertising on the service.

ZDNet Australia uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security. ZDNet also links to a wide variety of other sites. We are not responsible for their privacy policies or how they treat information about their users.
