# ZDNet UK Privacy Statement

  
|  This overall Privacy Statement for ZDNet UK discloses the privacy practices for the entire Web site. Our aim is to be open about how we collect personal information and what we do with it. We have applied for independent scrutiny of our privacy policies by an independent body. 

Because this site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed and audited by an external body (to be announced here shortly). This statement describes:- 

  1. What information the site gathers/tracks about you 
  2. What this site does with the information it gathers/tracks. 
  3. With whom this site shares the information it gathers/tracks. 

ZDNet UK collects personal information from you from our use of 'cookie' technology and IP address logging as you use the service, during entry into competitions, and from your participation in optional online surveys. We may exchange some of this information with business partners who offer co-branded services as part of ZDNet UK - for example QXL, Monster, RadioSpy. The information you provide allows us to inform you about updates to the service and to notify you of products and services from ZDNet UK, its affiliates, and third parties that we believe may be of interest to you. As part of the entry procedure for competitions, we give you the opportunity to decline to receive any mailings from ZDNet UK and other companies to whom we may provide such information. All of our Newsletters contain unsubscribe information in every mailing. 

The data we collect from cookies, IP addresses and optional online surveys give us demographic information about the entire ZDNet UK audience, which we use to improve the ZDNet UK service. We also share aggregate information -- not individual data -- with our advertisers to help them better understand our services and to monitor the reach of their advertising on the service. ZDNet UK also may disclose or exchange with others information you have provided to us if we believe in good faith that the law requires us to do so or if it is necessary to protect the rights or property of ZDNet UK or of our users. 

ZDNet UK uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed to us secure and to disclose such information only to third parties we believe to be responsible. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties which receive the information. ZDNet UK also links to a wide variety of other sites and contains advertisements from third parties. We are not responsible for advertisers' privacy policies or how they treat information about their users. 

If you have questions, you should direct them to the ZDNet UK site Privacy Coordinator, [eugene_lacey@zd.com](mailto:eugene_lacey@zd.com).
