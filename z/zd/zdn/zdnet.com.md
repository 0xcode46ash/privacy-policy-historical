# ZDNet: Privacy

   
Your Privacy Matters To Us

[](https://www.truste.org/validate/381) This Overall Privacy Statement verifies that ZDNet is a member of the TRUSTe program and is in compliance with TRUSTe privacy principles. This statement discloses the privacy practices for the entire Web site. 

TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit initiative whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of disclosure and informed consent. Because this site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed and audited for compliance by TRUSTe. When you visit a Web site displaying the TRUSTe mark, you can expect to be notified of: 

1.What information this site gathers/tracks about you  
2.What this site does with the information it gathers/tracks  
3.With whom this site shares the information it gathers/tracks 

ZDNet collects personal information from you (name, postal address, e-mail address, and other data) during registration for the ZDNet service, from our use of "cookie" technology and IP-address logging as you use the service, during entry into a contest or sweepstakes, and from your participation in optional online surveys. We may exchange some of this information with business partners who offer co-branded services as part of ZDNet, such as eCircles, Deja.com, Techies.com, onebox.com and others. The information you provide allows us to inform you about updates to the service and to notify you of products and services of ZDNet, its affiliates, and third parties that we believe may be of interest to you. As part of the registration process, we give you the opportunity to decline to receive any mailings from ZDNet and other companies to whom we may provide such information. 

The ZDNet service is directed to teenagers and adults and is not directed to children under the age of 13. ZDNet complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and does not permit registration by and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. This requirement will be posted wherever ZDNet collects data within the ZDNet service, such as during the registration process. 

The data we collect from cookies and IP addresses gives us demographic information about the entire ZDNet audience, which we use to improve the ZDNet service. We also share aggregate information -- not individual data -- with our advertisers to help them better understand our services and to monitor the reach of their advertising on the service. ZDNet also may disclose or exchange with others information you have provided to us if we believe in good faith that the law requires us to do so or if it is necessary to protect the rights or property of ZDNet or our users. 

Advertisers on ZDNet may deliver their ads via third-party advertising networks. One of these networks, Engage, is used on ZDNet occasionally for serving and/or targeting of banner ads, promotions and other marketing messages. Engage collects anonymous data, typically through the use of cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out of the Engage system, go to: <http://www.engage.com/privacy>

ZDNet uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed to us secure and to disclose such information only to third parties we believe to be responsible. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties which receive the information. ZDNet also links to a wide variety of other sites and contains advertisements of third parties. We are not responsible for their privacy policies or how they treat information about their users. 

Users of the ZDNet eCircles service should be aware that eCircles may also collect information about you and may exchange that information with other business partners to verify your identity and to give you access to their services. On ZDNet eCircles, the content sent to a circle is posted and available to all of the other members of that particular circle but is not publicly available on the Web. When you are voluntarily participating in and sending information to your circles, the information disclosed by you could be collected and used by others who visit that circle. 

You may correct your member information or select the option not to receive ZDNet mailings by going [here](http://members.zdnet.com/edituser). If you have questions, you should direct them to the ZDNet site privacy coordinator at [privacy@zdcommunity.com](mailto:privacy@zdcommunity.com) or [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/) for clarification.

For more information about the company, go here: <http://www.cnet.com/aboutcnet/0-13612-7-309130.html>.

This privacy policy applies to the U.S. operations of all brands and services within the CNET Networks family.

**Overall Privacy Statement**  
CNET Networks takes your privacy seriously. Because we gather certain types of information about our users we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. These privacy practices apply to the Web site that you were viewing when you clicked through to this policy, which is operated by CNET, its partner or affiliate.

**1\. What Personally Identifiable Information Does CNET Networks Collect?**  
CNET's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services. Because CNET derives its revenue mainly from advertising, collecting information is essential to keeping our services free to users.

CNET collects personally identifiable information when you provide it to us, such as when you register on one of our sites, when you subscribe for a print magazine or an e-mail newsletter, when you use certain products or services, such as our CatchUp software, and when you visit CNET pages and read newsletters. Several of the services that we offer on our sites, such as auctions and message boards, may require registration as a condition of use. Once you register with one of our CNET sites you are no longer anonymous to us. CNET may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us.

**2\. What Anonymous Information Does CNET Networks Collect?**  
_Cookies_  
Your Internet browser has a feature called "cookies" which store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of our sites. However, cookies tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit most CNET sites, although active participation in certain areas of our sites may require cookies. In addition, you may elect not to allow cookies to be collected by selecting certain options on your browser.

_Web Bugs & Servers_  
We use electronic images known as Web bugs - sometimes called single-pixel GIFs, transparent GIFs, or clear gifs- that allow us to track general user traffic patterns. CNET also automatically receives and records information from our servers and from your browser including your IP address, the time, and information about the page you requested.

We use tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including: 

  * keeping count of return visits to our site or our advertiser' or partners' sites 
  * accumulating and report anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical information on Web site and advertisement usage 
  * determining which features users like best 
  * saving your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites 

_Third-Party Advertisement Servers_  
Some of our advertisers use third-party companies to serve their advertisements on our sites and, in some cases, in our HTML-formatted newsletters. Often, these third-party advertising companies employ cookie and Web bug technologies to measure advertisement effectiveness. We do not give any personally identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Use of their tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies. If you would like more information about the privacy policies of the third-party advertising providers including information on how to opt out of their tracking methods, check: http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp.

**3\. How Does CNET Networks Use The Information?**  
CNET uses the information we gather for four general purposes: 

  * to customize the advertising and content you see, which helps keep our services free to users 
  * to enhance the user experience in our network of sites. We use tracking information to determine how well each page performs overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns to those pages. This helps us continue to build a better service for you 
  * to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, such as sending out electronic newsletters and enabling users to participate in polls, contests, message boards, and auctions 
  * to send you information you agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to you 

**4\. How Does CNET Networks Share The Information?**  
_Personally Identifiable Information_  
CNET will make your personally identifiable information available to other companies or people when: 

  * we have your consent to share the information 
  * we have engaged companies to work with or on behalf of CNET to provide a product or service that you have requested, such as opt-in e-mail announcements 
  * you use co-branded services. When you use a co-branded service within our network of sites you grant us permission to pass your registration information back to that service partner. Their use of your information is subject to their applicable privacy policies. 
  * we respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or we believe that your actions violate applicable laws, CNET's Terms of Use or any usage guidelines for specific products or services, or threaten the rights, property or safety of CNET, our users, or others 

_Aggregate Information_  
CNET aggregates personally identifiable information and discloses such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional and other purposes. We do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.

_ChannelOnline Data_  
Companies that use our ChannelOnline services may enter account data for third-party services. This information is necessarily passed on to those third parties when their ordering system is accessed. ChannelOnline users may also enter data about their customer orders. This information is shared only in aggregate form with third parties.

_Business Transfers_  
We are always seeking to improve our network of Web sites and our business. In accomplishing these objectives, we may buy or sell a company, or one or more of the companies in our corporate family may merge with or be acquired by another company. If we sell a business, we may transfer some or all of your information as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may continue or for other business purposes.

**5\. What Are My Options?**  
Users who would rather not provide any of the user data requested by our registration process do not need to register with us. You can still view much of the content and use many of the services offered by our sites without registering.

We also give users the following options: 

  * opting not to receive our electronic newsletters or those of third parties when registering. Users who opt-in may remove themselves from mailing lists at any time through the subscription management pages or by following the instructions at the end of the e-mail they received from us; 
  * opting not to provide certain personal information when registering for a site.

**7\. How Will I Know If The Privacy Policy Is Changed?**  
Any modifications to our privacy practices will be reflected first within this area of our network of Web sites. If there is a material change in our privacy practices, we will indicate on our sites that our privacy practices have changed and provide a link to the new privacy statement. If we are going to be using the information collected from users in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will send affected users written notice of the change.

**8\. Privacy of Children**  
Our network of sites is not directed to children under the age of 13. We operate our network of sites in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and do not permit registration by, and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13 years of age. This requirement is clearly posted during the registration process.
