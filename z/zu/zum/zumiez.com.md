From time to time our privacy policy may change; our most recent information will be posted on our Site. Look for the revision date; it will inform you on the latest day of modification.

Privacy of Children on Our Site

The Childre's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age; and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certail features of our Site. Below we explain how we comply with COPPA. When we use the term "parent" below, we mean to include legal guardians.

Information should not be submitted to or posted at Zumiez.com by guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. If Zumiez.com learns that a guest under 13 years of age has submitted personally indentifiable information online Zumiez will take reasonable measures to delete such information from its databases and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required by law).

Children can browse Zumiez.com without any personal information being collected. We do not collect personal information from children unless they register with our Site. Children may register in order to participate in sweepstakes or contests or to participate in an activity. We will not condition a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. The only information we collect from children during our registration process is:

  * Full name
  * Email address
  * Phone number



We collect birth dates to validate the ages of our guests, including children. We do not collect any other peronally indentifiable information from children during our registration process. We also will collect a child's e-mail address from a parent for the purpose of sending the child e-mail related to a subcription.

If a child registers for a sweepstakes or contest, we use the parent's e-mail address to notify the parent of the child's registration request and to get the parent's permission to allow the child's registration and entry. We may collect a child's e-mail address from the parent in order to send the child a newsletter. In addition, we may share a child's personal information with third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security of integrity of our Site; to take precautions against liability; to respond to judicial process; or to the extent permitted under provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety. Information is shared with third party service providers to manage our customer information, including shipping, name and address verification, email distribution, market research and promotions management. Those parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the information. Parents have the right to consent to Zumiez's collection of their children's information without agreeing to allow Zumiez to disclose the information to third parties.

Parents always have the right to review personal information that we have collected from their children. At any time parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their child and can request that any personal information we have collected be deleted from our records. Parents may review, change or delete the personally identifiable information that we have collected from their children by logging on to the child's account at the [My Account Home Page](https://www.zumiez.com/modcustomer/account/login) located at https://www.zumiez.com/zshop/MyAccount/Login.aspx. The parent will need to have their child's member name and password. There are instructions on the My Account home page explaining how to recover a password if the child has forgotten it. Parents can also contact our customer service department to review, change or delete the personal information that we have collected from his or her child by sending an e-mail to [help@zumiez.com](mailto:help@zumiez.com)

We will provide parents notice via email of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and/or share children's personal information. Parents should consistently update their personal information to provide us current e-mail addresses. We will apply material changes in our Privacy Policy only in conformance with applicable law, including any applicable provisions of COPPA that require parental consent.
