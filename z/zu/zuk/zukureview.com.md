**ZUKU PRIVACY POLICY**  
We at Zuku respect the privacy of your information.  We are providing this policy as an explanation about our online information practices and as a show of our commitment to protect your privacy.  
Upon your registration with us for access to our test taking materials or to purchase other products and services, we will only ask you to provide information that we need in order to deliver the service, product or other information that you have requested from us.  We do not sell or rent personal information collected during your use of the Zuku web site without your permission.

**Personal Information That You Give Us:   **If you register with us through our web site for access to our test taking materials or to purchase other products and services, you provide us with and we will collect and store:

We need your personal information to provide, and, in some cases to authorize our retail partners and service providers to provide, or to process orders for, the services and products that you request from us.  We also need this information to facilitate customization of your individual test results and to access stored information if you intend to utilize our test taking materials.  In addition to providing personalized results, the information that you supply at registration and through other communications with us is important for providing you with specific instructional information related to our test taking materials, for us to be able to communicate with you or to otherwise service your account.  We may also ask you to participate voluntarily in our follow-up surveys so that you can rate the effectiveness of our test taking materials and our web site’s features. 

We may share the information that we collect about you with third parties from one or more of the following categories:

(1) Retailer partners  
(2) Service providers

  1. Credit card companies
  2. Transaction processing companies
  3. Banks
  4. Government Agencies



**Automatic Collection of Statistical Information:**   In addition, we automatically gather general statistical information about the Zuku web site, visitors to our site and members who have registered to receive our services or products such as IP addresses, browser type, pages viewed, number of visitors, etc., but in doing so we do not reference you by individual name, e-mail address, mailing address or telephone number.  We use this data in the aggregate to determine how much our visitors or members use portions of the Zuku site so we can improve our site.  We may provide this statistical information to third parties, but when we do so, we do not provide your personal information without your permission. 

**Information from Cookies:**   A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive.  We use cookies to allow you to move quickly through the Zuku site, to allow you to take advantage of our site’s special features and to collect information about your use of our site.  We use cookies to remind us of who you are and to enable us to access your account information so that you do not have to re-enter it; gather statistical information about usage by visitors and members, research visiting patterns, and help target advertisements based on visitor and member interests; assist our retail partners, service providers and advertisers track visits and process orders; and track the progress of and participation in giveaways, contests and promotions.  In some instances, our retail partners, service providers and advertisers may use their own cookies.  Preferences and options configurations in your browser determine if and how a cookie will be accepted.  You can change these configurations in your computer if you desire.  By changing your preferences, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a cookie is set, or you can reject all cookies.  If you decide to disable all cookies, you may be required to re-enter your information more often and certain features of the Zuku web site may not be available to you.  

By registering to become a member of the Zuku web site, you have expressly authorized us to use your personal information to contact you regarding administrative notices and communications relevant to your use of the Zuku web site. 

We may also use your personal information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as our daily question e-mails that may include information on our sponsorships or new services, products, giveaways, contests and promotions.  You can check the appropriate box and elect to **“opt in”** to receive daily question e-mails by so indicating on your membership page accessed by clicking on the “Edit My Profile” icon.  In the event that the giveaway, contest or promotion is sponsored by a third party, by **“opting in”** to receive the daily question e-mail, you give us your express permission to provide your name and e-mail address to the third party sponsoring the giveaway, contest or promotion.

We use your personal information to customize the Zuku web site’s content, layout and services, to improve our content and service or product offerings, to statistically analyze site usage data and to improve our marketing and promotional efforts. 

If you place a request for products or services, we use your information for purposes of enrollment; to complete, process and, if applicable, ship your order or otherwise service your account.  If the products or services are from a retail partner or service provider, we may provide your relevant information to that retailer or service provider for purposes of completing the transaction.  If you establish a credit account with Zuku or our providers, we collect additional information, including billing information; credit card number, authorization code and expiration date and tracking information from any checks or money orders. 

We may also access and use information to resolve disputes, investigate problems or enforce our member agreement.  At times, we may review status or activity of multiple visitors or members to do so.  Additionally, we may access information whenever we believe in good faith that the law so requires or if we otherwise consider it necessary to do so to maintain our services or improve our products and services.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to manage the Zuku web site and to enhance our site based on the usage pattern data that we receive. 

We employ reasonable and current methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use of information.  All users must have a unique username and password combination to gain access to the member portion of the web site.  The login will employ SSL encryption across https.  All user data will be stored in a mySQL database on a secure server at our service provider’s hosting facilities.  All passwords are encrypted in the database. 

You need to keep your password secret so that the personal information you have entered on the Zuku web site remains private.  Our personnel will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail.  You should sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your session.  This is to help ensure that others cannot access your personal information if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place where others may have access to it.  Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example on message boards or in discussion forums, through e-mail or in other areas, that information can be collected and used by others, as may the username and e-mail address that you use.

No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure.  As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information that you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. 

We have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who access our web site, and so we carry out the same Privacy Policy for individuals of all ages.  If a child has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove this information.  Additionally, the parent or guardian should attempt to access the child’s membership page through clicking on the “Edit My Profile” button and uncheck the box for daily question e-mails to **“opt out”** of promotional opportunities.

If you are located outside of the United States, please note that the personal data you provide to us will be transferred to the United States.  Whenever you submit any personal data to us, you consent to this transfer.

The privacy policy of a third party advertiser, service provider or promotional service appearing at our site may differ from our own Privacy Policy.  When you click on links and ad banners that take you to third party web sites or otherwise access another web site to purchase products or services or to complete transactions, the use of any information that you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.  We encourage you to read the other party’s privacy policy before responding to an offer for a product or service or otherwise completing a transaction. 

We may occasionally release information about our site visitors and members when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our member agreement; or to protect rights, property or the safety of visitors to our sites, our members, the public, or our company and its employees, agents, partners and affiliates.  As our business grows, we may purchase or sell various assets.  In the event that we choose to sell our company or the bulk of our assets relating to this site, information on our visitors and members would be among the transferred assets.

This Privacy Policy became effective on September 25, 2006.  If we choose to update or modify this Privacy Policy, such updated or modified policy shall become effective five (5) business days after its posting on our site.  Accordingly, we encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy and our site to keep apprised of our current privacy practices.

If you are a registered member of our site, you may review, correct, update or delete your personal data by clicking the “Edit My Profile” icon on your membership page.  Alternatively, you can contact us at the mailing address, e-mail address or fax number as noted below.  Your account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will result in your not being able to access member services. ****
