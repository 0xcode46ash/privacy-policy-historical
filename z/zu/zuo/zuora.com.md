# On-Demand Subscription Management - Zuora Privacy Statement

### Zuora Privacy Policy

Founded in 2007 by SaaS industry veterans from [salesforce.com](http://www.salesforce.com/ "salesforce.com") and [WebEx](http://www.webex.com/ "webex.com"), Zuora has created an on demand platform designed to simplify the way online subscription services are purchased, billed, and provisioned. Zuora, Inc is backed by Benchmark Capital and located in Redwood City, California. For more information about Zuora, Inc. visit [www.zuora.com](http://www.zuora.com/) or email [info@zuora.com](mailto:info@zuora.com).

### Collected Information

We require people who register to use a Zuora online application (the "Services") to give us contact information. Depending on the services chosen, we ask for contact and account information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, e-mail address, password and the number of users in the organization who will be using the Services, in addition to financial and billing information, such as billing name, address and credit card number. When you express interest in additional information, when you register for the Services, or after you become a user, we may ask for additional personal information, such as title, department name, fax number or additional company information, such as annual revenues, number of employees or industry. You can opt out of providing additional information by not entering it when asked.

Zuora does not distribute or share customer e-mail addresses, except as noted in its Terms of Service, or as may be required by law.

Zuora uses the information we collect to set up the Services for individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information to contact customers and prospects to further discuss their interest in our company, the Services we provide and ways we can improve them, and to send information such as announcements of promotions and events regarding our company or partners. We may also e-mail a customer newsletter and updates about the Services or the company. You can opt out of receiving these communications by replying to them at the time they are distributed or at any time by e-mailing [support@Zuora.com](mailto:support@Zuora.com "mailto:support@Zuora.com").

### Correcting and Updating Your Information

To update or change registration information, to update billing information, or to discontinue the Services, log on to the Services at a Zuora Web site, click the Setup tab, and click links to these tasks. You can also correct and update information by e-mailing [support@Zuora.com](mailto:support@Zuora.com "mailto:support@Zuora.com").

All financial and billing information that we collect through a Zuora Web site and the Services is used solely to bill for the Services. Zuora does not use this billing information for marketing or promotional purposes. Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as provided for in the Zuora Terms of Service, we do not disclose to any third party the information provided.

Zuora has referral relationships with third-party companies and individuals ("Referral Partners") who refer their customers to Zuora. Customers who become paying users of a Zuora online application through a Referral Partner are considered customers of both Zuora and the Referral Partner. Zuora and a Referral Partner may share customer contact as well as account, financial and billing information with respect to their joint business relationship with the customer. The sharing of this information allows Zuora and the Referral Partner to establish the identity of the shared customer and determine referral fees owed. This sharing also allows Referral Partners to provide consolidated billing services to the shared customer. Shared contact and account, financial and billing information is governed by the Zuora Terms of Service. Zuora does not share your business data with Referral Partners.

Zuora has integration relationships with third-party companies and individuals ("Integration Partners"). These relationships extend the functionality of the Services and the Integration Partner application or service ("Integrated Service") by allowing the Services and the Integrated Service to exchange customer data and to establish linked business processes between the two. Customers who pay Zuora for use of the Services and use this Integrated Service are considered customers of both Zuora and the Integration Partner. Zuora and an Integration Partner may share customer contact, account, financial and billing information, and business data with respect to their integrated business relationship with the customer. The sharing of this information allows Zuora and the Integration Partner to establish the identity of the shared customer and determine referral fees owed. This sharing also allows the Integration Partner to provide consolidated billing services to the shared customer and allows for the enhanced functionality of the integrated service. Shared contact, account, financial and billing information, and business data is governed by the Zuora Terms of Service.

Zuora uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.

Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide information on a Zuora Web site, but they are not permitted to collect any information, nor does Zuora share any personally identifiable user information with these parties.

Zuora customers use Zuora online applications to host data and information. Zuora will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such data except as provided in the Zuora Terms of Service, or as may be required by law. We will view or access individual records only with your permission (for example, to resolve a problem or support issue). Of course, users of the Services are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and passwords.

Zuora may also collect certain information from visitors to a Zuora Web site and customers of the Services, such as Internet addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems and to administer the Zuora Web site and Services in order to constantly improve quality. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.

### Cookies

Cookies are files Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive. They are used to help us authenticate clients and provide timesaving shortcuts and preferences. Zuora uses a persistent encrypted cookie, if the client requests, to save and retrieve individual authentication information as well as other per-client device preferences. When a visitor follows a link to the Zuora Web site from an affiliate or promotion, Zuora stores information about that affiliate or promotion in a session cookie. Acceptance of these cookies is optional. Zuora issues a mandatory session cookie to each user of the Services only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session. If you reject this cookie, access to and usage of the Services will be denied.

### Third Party Sites

The Zuora Web site and online applications contain links to other Web sites. Zuora is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other Web sites. Customers and visitors must check the policy statement of these others Web sites to understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information. It is your responsibility to keep such information private and confidential.

### Security

Zuora has security measures in place for the Services to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the data under Zuora's control. When the Services are accessed using Netscape Navigator, or Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0 or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure data is safe, secure and available only to you. Zuora also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications and hosts the Services in a secure server environment using a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, Zuora requires unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of data.

### Opt-Out Policy

Zuora offers you a means to choose how we may use information you provided. If, at any time after registering for information or ordering the Services, you change your mind about receiving information from us or about sharing information with third parties, send us a request specifying your new choice. Send your request to [support@Zuora.com](mailto:support@Zuora.com "mailto:support@Zuora.com").
