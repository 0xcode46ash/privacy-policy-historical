When you express interest in additional information, when you register for the Services, or after you become a user, we may ask for additional personal information, such as title, department name, fax number or additional company information, such as annual revenues, number of employees or industry. You can opt out of providing additional information by not entering it when asked. Zuora Services users, while you are logged into your account you will have the ability to provide us with third party personal information, such as name, email address, phone number, street address and password. This information is used to set up accounts of your customers so that you may bill them for the services that you provide them and so that you can keep track of the payments that have been made and/or are past due.
