### Collected Information

We require people who register to use a Zuora online application (the "Services") to give us contact information. Depending on the Services chosen, we ask for contact and account information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, e-mail address, password, and the number of users in the organization who will be using the Services, in addition to financial and billing information, such as billing name, address and credit card number. When you express interest in additional information, when you register for the Services, or after you become a user, we may ask for additional personal information, such as title, department name, fax number or additional company information, such as annual revenues, number of employees or industry. You can opt out of providing additional information by not entering it when asked. Zuora Services users, while you are logged into your account you will have the ability to provide us with third party personal information, such as name, email address, phone number, street address and password. This information is used to set up accounts of your customers so that you may bill them for the services that you provide them and so that you can keep track of the payments that have been made and/or are past due.

### Communications from the Site

Zuora does not distribute or share customer e-mail addresses or any other personal information, except as noted in its [Terms of Service](http://www.zuora.com/company/msa.html "MASTER SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT"), or as may be required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.

Zuora uses the information we collect to set up the Services for individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information to contact customers and prospects to further discuss their interest in our company, the Services we provide and ways we can improve them, and to send information such as announcements of promotions and events regarding our company or partners.
