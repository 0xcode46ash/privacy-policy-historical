# Zeeks | Privacy Policy

|  | 

Zeeks.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to explain our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site. 

We do not require that children become members of our site, and many of our activities are available to children who do not join. We offer additional features to children who join; the membership process, and those features, are described below. We do not require a child or parent to disclose more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in any activity. 

MEMBERSHIP PROCESS   
Zeeks.com does not collect personal contact information from children, such as name or physical address. To Zeeks, all children are anonymous. Zeeks' membership collects only nickname, password, gender, zip code, and birth date. We also collect a parent's email address, which we use solely to mail a notice to parents. Once the notice is emailed, we delete the email address from our system, and do not retain it. The general demographic information collected is used solely in aggregate form to report demographics to advertisers and to better target the activities we offer on Zeeks.com, and will never be used to try to identify your child. 

Parents have the right to review their child's personal information. At their request, we will also terminate and delete the child's account. To review or change the Zeeks.com information your child provided at registration, parents can use our online form at [ (http://www.zeeks.com/members/zeekedit.asp)](https://web.archive.org/members/zeekedit.asp). To review or change additional personal information we have about your child, contact us at 1-800-856-8979. To delete a child's Zeeks.com account at any time, parents can send a request in writing or call our toll-free number. 

INTERACTIVE FEATURES  


Members are given access to our interactive features. As with all such features, children can disclose personal information to their correspondents. All users should practice safe computing, and parents should advise their children not to give out any personal information without their parent's permission. 

By posting messages, submitting works, or sending email to Zeeks.com, you are giving Zeeks.com permission to publish, modify or use those communications. 

Game Reviews  
ZeekGames, with over 150 child-appropriate games, is one of the most popular areas of our site. In our Game Reviews, children can write their own reviews of the games. All the reviews are pre-screened for personal information and any other inappropriate content. We strip out any personal information submitted to us and delete it from our system, and we do not post any personal information. 

Calendar  
ZeeksCalendar lets children keep track of their appointments and schedule events. This information is only available by the child when they sign in. 

Factory  
Through our multimedia authoring tool, children can create and submit projects to us that are posted at our Web site. All the projects are pre-screened for personal information and any other inappropriate content. We do not publish any projects with personal information or inappropriate content; these projects are just left in the child's private folder. We strip out any personal information submitted to us and delete it from our system, and we do not post any personal information. 

Contests  
From time to time, we offer contests and sweepstakes to our visitors. We collect only the child's email address which we use only in order to enter them in the contest -- and their parent's email address, so that we can alert the parents that their child has entered the contest and give them a chance to ask us to remove their child's entry and information. We will only use this information to contact potential contest winners. If we need additional personal information, we will obtain that from the parent. Once a contest has ended, we will delete all the personal information collected from children. 

ADDITIONAL FEATURES   


These features are open to all children that visit Zeeks.com and do not need membership. 

ZeekCards  
Children can send ZeekCards, which are electronic postcards, including our Tell-A-Friend postcards.

Nikki's Place  
Children can submit questions or comments to the Zeeks family of characters. Some of the comments and responses are publicly posted, and some are responded to only via email. We delete all email and do not save it in a database. Messages that are to be publicly posted are pre-screened for personal information and any other inappropriate content.
