# Privacy Policy

**GENERAL INFORMATION**  
Zeeks.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to explain our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site. 

We do not require that anyone become a member of our site. We do not require a child or parent to disclose more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in any activity. 

**CLUB ZEEKS**  
Zeeks.com does not collect personal contact information from children, such as name or physical address. To Zeeks, all children are anonymous. Zeeks does however invite its users to provide their email address that we use solely to mail a notice to parents (in order to be made aware of new feature introductions, special offers or other information pertinent to the web site). Once the notice is emailed, we delete the email address from our system, and do not retain it unless you, the user, has requested to be kept informed. 

**INTERACTIVE FEATURES**  
All visitors to Zeeks are given access to our interactive features. All users should practice safe computing, and parents should advise their children not to give out any personal information without their parent's permission. These features are open to all children that visit Zeeks.com and do not need membership. 

**Game Reviews**  
ZeekGames, with hundreds of child-appropriate games, is one of the most popular areas of our site. In our Game Reviews, children can write their own reviews of the games. All the reviews are pre-screened for personal information and any other inappropriate content. We strip out any personal information submitted to us and delete it from our system, and we do not post any personal information. 

**Contests**  
From time to time, we offer contests and sweepstakes to our visitors. We collect only the child's email address which we use only in order to enter them in the contest -- and their parent's email address, so that we can alert the parents that their child has entered the contest and give them a chance to ask us to remove their child's entry and information. We will only use this information to contact potential contest winners. If we need additional personal information, we will obtain that from the parent. Once a contest has ended, we delete all the personal information collected from children. 

**ZeekCards**  
Children can send three different types of cards; Emoz, Animated Cards and Zeeks Cards, which are electronic postcards, including our Tell-A-Friend postcards. Children may choose from a variety of pre-approved messages when sending cards, and may send them to anyone. The ZeekCards are available on our Web site only to the recipient, who is given a link to view the card. The user is required to enter a nickname but nothing more. No personal information is collected. The recipient's email address is removed once they have viewed their card. 

**Nikki's Place**  
Children can submit questions or comments to the Zeeks family of characters. Some of the comments and responses are publicly posted. We delete all email and do not save it in a database. Messages that are publicly posted are pre-screened for personal information and any other inappropriate content. We strip out any personal information submitted to us and delete it from our system, and we do not post any personal information. 

**ZeekSearch**  
Our search engine allows children to search appropriate Web sites. In addition, a word filter keeps children from searching other sites for information deemed inappropriate or harmful for children. 

**Feedback**  
We offer a feedback feature for all our users. There is a text box for users to write whatever they want to tell us. Also, users have the option of providing their email address, so that we can respond to them. Once we respond, we delete the email address and the feedback form from our system. 

**LINKS TO OTHER SITES**  
We try to provide as safe and private an environment as possible at Zeeks.com. For the enjoyment of your child, we also link to other sites. We are not responsible for other sites, and we advise you to check their privacy policies as well. 

**COOKIES AND OTHER INFORMATION**  
Zeeks.com does not store any personal information in cookies. Our cookies simply contain a unique number for each member that identifies who is visiting our website. The information that the cookie number relates to is what we have gathered from members when they join, and related information gathered from parents during the permission process. The cookie number does not relate to any kind of personal tracking, surfing, browsing, clicks, etc. Some features of Zeeks.com may not function properly if you disable cookies in your browser. 

**ADVERTISING**  
At this time we target ads by the content area of Zeeks such as Games, Nikki's Place, etc. We do not track any personal information on Zeeks and therefore do not provide any such information to advertisers. We can provide advertisers with aggregate information such as "30% of users did this...". 

**IP Addresses**  
We do not attempt to use your IP address to identify you personally. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information.
