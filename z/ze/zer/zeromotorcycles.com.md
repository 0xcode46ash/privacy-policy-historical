## What kind of information does Zero collect?

When you signup for our newsletter or a demo ride, purchase items at a dealer, request a quote in our online store, contact us with a question or concern, send diagnostic information using the Zero app, or participate in a contest, promotion or survey, we may collect information such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address and contact preferences. 

When you visit our website, we collect information sent to us by your computer. This information includes standard web log information, including your IP address, browser type, and the pages you accessed on our site with the time and date. 

We collect personal information you choose to enter when you submit a form, including your first name, last name, email address, phone number, street, city, state, country, postal code, product interest, questions and whether or not you want to subscribe to our newsletter. Additionally, when you submit a form, we record how you got to our site (e.g. email link, search terms, ad campaign, referral site, etc.). 

The Zero Motorcycles App gives you the ability to email diagnostic information to the Zero Motorcycles Customer Service Group. This will include the motorcycle’s settings (VIN, model, etc.) along with information from your motorcycle’s event and error logs, which may include time/date of rides along with the motorcycle state during these rides: speeds, temperatures, charging events and other measures of performance significance. Statistical data about your ride and usage of the app, including but not limited to distance travelled, average speed and energy consumption may also be submitted. If you choose to email the bike log information to Zero Motorcycles, it will be associated with your name and email address and may be shared with dealers, distributors and Zero Motorcycles personnel. We use this diagnostic information to resolve issues with your motorcycle and to help us improve product quality. 

The Zero Motorcycles App includes technology from Flurry Analytics which provides us with information about usage patterns and helps us determine the best areas for improvement. Flurry also records the types of devices and operating systems used, general geographic information, as well as events that occur within the Zero App, such as how often it is used and other anonymous data. This information helps us determine which mobile devices and languages we should support. For more information about Flurry, its privacy policy and how to opt out of this service, please go to [www.flurry.com/user-opt-out.html](http://www.flurry.com/user-opt-out.html).

## How does Zero use my information?

We may use your personal information in the following ways:

  * To communicate with you. Upon your request, we send you information about Zero’s latest products, services, upcoming events and special promotions. You may opt out from our mailing list by selecting the “One-Click Unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of each Zero newsletter.
  * To answer any questions or concerns you may have about our products, services, and website.
  * To connect you with a nearby Zero Motorcycles dealer if you are interested in signing up for a demo ride or making a purchase. If you have selected a specific dealer, you will be connected with that dealer; otherwise you will be connected with the dealer who is located nearest to you.
  * For internal purposes such as data analysis and research to improve our products, services and customer communications. When you request information from Zero or one of our dealers or partners, you will be asked to participate in a follow-up survey. We want to make sure you are receiving good service.
  * To run a promotion or contest. Entering Zero promotions and contests involves either submitting a form on our website, mailing an entry form to Zero, or giving an entry form to a Zero dealer. For select promotions and contests Zero Motorcycles may share your entry information with a third party.
  * To send you important updates about products that you have purchased. These updates are for your benefit only and are not marketing related.
  * To resolve issues with your motorcycle and to help us improve product quality. The Zero Motorcycles App gives you the ability to email diagnostic information to the Zero Motorcycles Customer Service Group.
