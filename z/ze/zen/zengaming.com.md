# IndoHot.com - indohot Site Policy

  
**I N D I A S P I D E R    P R I V A C Y**

Most people don't want everyone to know their personal information. For example, your real name (people usually use nicknames), home address, phone number, or email address. Still, many web sites collect your personal information when you go online, even without your knowledge. 

_indohot’S POLICY_   
indohot’s policy on all our Internet sites is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. indohot will never disclose any individual information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer's permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. 

indohot shares information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. However, in most cases, we talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we will say indohot’s audience is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize indohot content and advertising for our users.

When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. For example, we may want to post the names of contest winners on our site or send you materials via email or regular mail at your request. In case you change your mind or some personal information may change (such as your marital status), we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us.

_USE OF COOKIES_   
indohot uses cookies in some of our web sites. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It stores personal preferences and user data.

For example, if you choose to customize your news page, indohot will store your choice of selections. The next time you login to the news page, your customized topics will show up automatically.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of the indohot service may not function properly if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set customized news preferences.

_LINKS TO OTHER SITES_   
indohot has many links to other web sites. These links can be our sponsors, advertisers, partners or search site listings. Information collected by external sites is beyond our control. We cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.

We reserve the right to make changes to this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
