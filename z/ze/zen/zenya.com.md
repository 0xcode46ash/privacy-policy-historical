Your privacy and the safeguarding of your personal information are very important to us. To better protect your privacy, we adhere to industry best privacy principles with respect to the data collection practices on our web site.

This processing entails the use of cookies or tags (defined in section 2.3 below) on a computer or using information in any way including (but not limited to) the collection, storage, deletion, use, combining and disclosing information, all of which will take place in the United States. If you reside outside of the US, your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the US and processed and stored in the US under US privacy standards. By visiting our Site or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions, comments or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the use of your personally identifiable information, please contact us at privacy@zenya.com.

2\. Receipt and Collection of Information

We receive and/or collect information from you in the following ways:

2.1. General Access to the Site

We do not currently require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to general information available on our Site. If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you may be required to become a registered user and to submit certain personally identifiable information to us.

2.2. Purchases 

If you choose to use a service or product from us (including a free trial),we will require sufficient information from you to be able to provide that service or product. Such information could include a credit card number and related account and billing information, invoice related information, and other data . We may also update such data should you grant us permission to bill you or your credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly or other types of periodic payments. We may use the tools, software or services of third-party service providers to process transactions on our behalf (but we require that these parties too provide a Privacy Policy).

2.3. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Cookies

Some of our Site pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that is transferred to your computer that may be used, for example, to collect information about Site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Site user. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and with and any services or Promotions we provide via the Site including our Subscription Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve usability and performance of the Site. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. You may block cookies, delete existing cookies or ask to be prompted before accepting a cookie from this Site and any web sites you visit by adjusting the appropriate setting on your browser. Please consult your browser’s Help tools to learn how to do this. If you block or delete "cookies" you may find the usefulness of our Site to be impaired. Please note that blocking cookies is a global setting and will apply to any web site you visit and not just our Site.

Tags

In addition to cookies, we implement tags on our Site for tracking purposes. A tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, embedded on a web page also known as “tracking pixels”, “pixel tags”, “clear GIFs” or “web beacons.” Tags are used to monitor the activity of a web site and are not typically visible to the user. We use third parties to assist us in carrying out and measuring the effectiveness of our Site and external advertising campaigns. Our tags do not enable third parties to collect your Personal Information. Rather, when you visit the Site, these tags will direct your browser to these third parties who may thereby set or read a cookie on your computer and collect information about your visit. This information may include your IP address (unique identifier of your local computer), cookie ID, elements of the Site that are viewed and/or clicked, referring site, information on searches you perform, time spent on pages on the Site, date/time information and other statistics that might help us improve our site design and content in an effort to serve you and your needs in the future.

The information inside the log files includes the IP address from which you access the Site, the type of browser and operating system you use to access the Site, the date and time you access the Site, the pages you visit, and the addresses of pages from where you followed a link to the Site. We may use such information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement around the Site, and gather demographic information. Such information is not linked to any information that is Personal Information, with the exception of the IP address which might be used to identify spamming attempts.

2.5. Personal Information Collected - Order History

With the exception of credit card info, we store the information from your order history to allow us to provide you with accurate data for purchasing and reporting purposes, track issues or refer to a previous order to help provide some customer service. You may elect to have your information completely removed from this system by e-mailing us at privacy@zenya.com with your request.

3\. Publicly Available Information

Any information, video, image, data, text, documents, or other content posted at your direction onto a public area of the Site, such as Magento Forum, becomes publicly published content and will be available to all users of that public area of the Site, even if such content contains Personal Information. Please note that if you publish your contact information, you may receive unsolicited messages from users and visitors to the Site. We encourage you to publish only information you are sure you want to be accessible to anyone.

Your email should include adequate details of your request and also show the subject of "Access Request". We will provide initial responses to access requests within a reasonable period of time.

8\. Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites

Our Site may use a reputable third party to present or serve advertisements that you may see at our Site. These third party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons, clear gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy.

9\. Links to Other Sites

Our Site contains links to other sites. Other sites may also reference or link to our Site. Our linking to another web site is in no way an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party web sites. These other web sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other web sites you visit.

10\. Children's Privacy

The Site is not intended for or structured to attract children under the age of 18. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 18 years of age. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us at info@zenya.com. If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will remove such information from our files.

11\. In the Event of Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy

In the event that Info.com is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your Personal Information is treated, transferred, or used. In any of the circumstances described in this paragraph, the information will be subject to the privacy policy of the purchaser or assignee.

12\. Security

We employ advanced administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on the Site, you can contact us at info@info.com.

We will disclose any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

13\. Commitment

Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and accordingly we are constantly evolving the Site to meet these demands. If you have any comments, concerns, complaints or questions regarding our Privacy Policy or the Site, please contact us at info@zenya.com.
