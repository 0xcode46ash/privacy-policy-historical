#### Information Collection and Use 

Zenefits is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Zenefits collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

#### Registration

In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration/employee profile form. During registration, employers are required to grant Zenefits access to their payroll system, from which Zenefits imports information such as name, email address, date of birth, home address, and social security number for the company's employees. This information is used to quote prices for insurance products and other benefits. It is also used to enroll the company and employees in those products if they choose to enroll, and, if the employer chooses to enroll in a benefit program, to contact employees about enrollment and if they have problems. Zenefits cannot process a user's order without the registration information or allow access to the secure portion of the website, as we need this information to quote rates. 

#### Product Orders/Benefit Elections

We request information from the user on order forms. To make an order or benefit election, the user must have logon access to our site, and must have provided contact information (like name and shipping address) and possibly financial information (like checking account numbers). In some cases, we may import this information automatically from the payroll system. This information is used to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

#### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. After you enter your username and password and click the **Log On** button, we will use a session ID cookie to indicate the beginning of your employee session with Zenefits and make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. If you reject cookies, you will not be able to log on to our site. 

#### Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

#### Sharing

We will share aggregated information with our partners such as purchase trends and demographic data. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

With the exception stated in the next paragraph, we use outside companies to ship products to a user's home or office. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

Some providers require us to provide certain personal information, such as your name and address and other application information, in order for us to enroll you in benefits. YOU SHOULD NOT EXPECT ANY MORE PRIVACY OR SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MERELY BECAUSE IT WAS PASSED TO THOSE ENTITIES THROUGH Zenefits. Zenefits MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ABOUT THESE ENTITIES AND HOW THEY WILL TREAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. IF YOU CANNOT ACCEPT THIS RISK, YOU SHOULD NOT USE OUR SERVICES. 

#### Links

This website contains links to other sites. Please be advised that Zenefits is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website. 

#### Surveys

From time to time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user also has a choice to fill out the survey anonymously. Information requested may concern Zenefits processes, website usage, planned purchases and requested features. Contact information will be used to verify the validity of the input. Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this Zenefits website or for future product development.

#### Security

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.

When our registration imports sensitive information such as date of birth, home address and social security number, that information is encrypted using SSL. During this process, the user creates a username and password that establishes their account. Once the account is established, users must log on to update their profile, place orders or review account status - all of which are done on secure pages. While on a secure page, such as the registration or 'My Account' page, the icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Internet Explorer will show a 'locked' status. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information offline. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific function - such as customer support - are granted access to personally identifiable information. 

All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we use to store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. 

If you have any questions about the security of our website, you can send an email to [support@Zenefits.com](mailto:support@Zenefits.com). 

#### Confirmation Email and Selected Correspondence

We send all new members a confirming email to verify user information and purchases. Established members may periodically receive information on products and service enhancements or survey requests regarding the use of our site. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option of not receiving these types of communications. Please see our opt-out statement below. 

#### Updating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes such as the delivery address, we provide a way to correct, update or remove personal data that is provided to us. This can be done at the Employee Profile section of the website or via email to [support@Zenefits.com](mailto:support@Zenefits.com). User's personal information can also be updated based upon data provided to Zenefits from their employer, and via syncs with their employer's payroll system. 

#### Opt-in/Opt-out Choices

Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications not directly related to our site. For example, we may survey our users for information about their use of our site and services or about their interest in possible new products and service enhancements. Information on how to opt-out is included in our user agreement and can be made by contacting our customer service center.

Users who no longer wish to receive our correspondence or promotional materials from us or any partner acting on our behalf may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line of the email or by emailing us at [support@Zenefits.com](mailto:support@Zenefits.com). 

#### Legal Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.
