# Fitness Scheduling Software - Privacy Policy | Zen Planner

You do. All of the information that you store on Zen Planner – student records, schedule, attendance, billing, and payment information – belongs to you. We will make it as easy as possible for you to put information in and out of our software.

The only exception is credit card and bank account information. To be fully compliant with the credit card industry’s security standards, we are not permitted to export this data from our systems in any format. 

  


No. Our entire team is expressly forbidden from accessing your private information without your consent. This means that we may log in to your account in order to provide you with technical assistance, but we do not monitor the private information that you store on Zen Planner.

Our support team does monitor and create aggregate reports regarding general system usage – such as your ability to log into the website, server response times, and pages visited – in order to provide the best possible service for you. If you request it, we may also check in with you from time to time to see how we can better serve you. 

  


Absolutely not. We will not sell your information to any unrelated third parties. We respect your privacy and will limit our communications to the following situations. We will only send you email messages that are necessary to keep you informed about the status of your account, to provide you with customer service that you’ve requested, or to inform you of relevant services or offers that Zen Planner or our partners are providing. We will never sell or lease information from your account to unrelated third parties.

We will only allow your private information to be seen by another person in order to comply with a warrant or subpoena from the appropriate authorities in a legal investigation. We do not give out your private data to other private companies or government entities under any other circumstances. We will never ask you to share information about your students with our “marketing partners” or provide them with other “valuable offers.” 

  


About Cookies All modern web browsers support cookies, which are small, temporary pieces of information that are saved on your computer by your browser. Some are concerned about the potential for sneaky companies to abuse cookies, to save sensitive data on their computer that they do not know, or to monitor their online behavior. Please know that our use of cookies is governed by our customer service philosophy, and that they are never used in a misleading, or intrusive way.

Like most secure web applications, we use cookies to allow you to “log in” to our site because they are the most secure way of ensuring that your private data stays private. We will never store any personally identifiable information in cookies; they are only random numbers and letters that our servers use to keep track of which information you can access. 

We also use cookies to identify the computers that connect to this website. This is done to provide better customer service and to prevent fraud. For example, if a suspicious user attempts to log in to your account from an unknown computer in a distant country, we may block that computer from doing so.

Zen Planner uses cookies on our marketing website (www.zenplanner.com) to optimize our investment in our search engine optimization and search engine marketing programs. 

Specifically, Zen Planner has implemented Google Display Advertising and Remarketing. These Google Analytics features we’ve implemented are based on Displayed Advertising (e.g., Remarketing). 

Zen Planner and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to your website.

Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Preferences Manager.

Additionally, we also encourage visitors to explore the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. 

In all things, we constantly aim to do the right thing, and to do better than in the past. If we need to update this policy, we will do so to be more clear, open, and honest with you. If so, we will notify you about significant changes via email, or by posting a notice on the website.
