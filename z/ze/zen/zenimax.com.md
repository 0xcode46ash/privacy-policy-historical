## Information Collection By ZeniMax

ZeniMax collects information about you, including personal information, directly, automatically and through third parties.  For some activities, we combine personal information and other information, such as usage and demographic information.  For example, in some of our products or websites, we may ask you to create a username and password and provide personal information such as your age and date of birth. For certain products, ZeniMax may enhance or merge the personal information you provide with data from our third party partners in order to perform market analysis, better target users, or to improve its products, services, or systems. 

Depending on the ZeniMax website or product that you are using, certain of the activities described below may not be available; as such, the personal and other information (e.g., usage or demographic information) we collect varies depending on the website, product or service you are using.  Additionally, we do not require you to submit personal information to gain access to our websites; however, you will not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.

Below, we discuss the types of information we generally collect.

## The Information We Collect About You 

**_Personal Information.   _**Generally, personal information is information that identifies you or that can be used to contact you online or offline.  As noted, the information that ZeniMax collects from you varies depending upon the product, service, or system.  This information may include your name, credit or debit card information, email address, phone number, home address, zip code, country, birth date, mobile phone number, IP or MAC addresses, mobile device identifiers (e.g., UDID), and console device identifiers (e.g., XUID and PUID).

**_Automatically Collected Information._** We also may automatically or indirectly collect information from you and your computer or mobile device (such as when you use our services, through pixel tags embedded within email we send, from social media, and otherwise through our  products and services).  ZeniMax may combine this information with the other personal information we have collected about you in the context of online and mobile activities, such as online and mobile purchases, registration, or use of a product, service, or our games.  We (and our third party providers) may use cookies, pixel tags, local shared objects, java script, log files and other mechanisms to collect this information about you, which may include: location information; game capabilities; game data processing; browser, platform, system/console; software version; connection information; information about the date and time you access our websites and services and your activities within the services; IP address and other device information. 

**_Usage and Demographic Information_**. We may also collect other information such as demographic information (age, gender, occupation), username, user ID or persona, nickname, language, gaming preferences, game play statistics, scores and achievements, user rankings, time spent playing our games, click paths and other data that you submit to us, such as in surveys, account preferences, friends’ lists or purchases.  We may combine this information with the other information we have collected about you.

**_Third Party Accounts._** We also may allow you to log in to our websites or services through certain third party accounts, including via sign-in services such as Open ID, or through your social networking accounts, including Facebook (each a “Third Party Account”).  In order to login via a Third Party Account, you must agree to share certain information with us (including your user id and certain profile information) as stated on the permissions page when you login in with the Third Party Account.  You may also have the option to share other personal information with us, such as your name and email address.  The providers of these Third Party Accounts may also give you the option to post or share information or other content within our site and services, and they may also allow you to share information about your activities within our website or services to your profile page or with others within your network. These third parties’ information collection and sharing practices are subject to their own privacy policies.

**_Guest Players._** ****  Some of our games may allow you to play without creating an account and/or registering with us.  In such cases, we may assign you a guest user ID so that we can keep track of your game play, scores, stats, purchasing data and usage data for your current and future sessions.  If you later decide to register or create an account with us, we may associate your guest ID and the data from your guest session(s) with your account.

## More Information About How We Automatically Collect Information

  * Cookies



ZeniMax and its third party service providers may use cookies, beacons, scripts, e-tags, and other technologies to improve the use of our websites, products and services. A “cookie” is a small file or record-keeping device that websites often store on a user’s computer, mobile device or other device.  Storage of cookies provides an easy and convenient method for a personalized experience. For example, cookies allow you to log in, allow us to remember your screen name, tell us that you have visited our website before, and may contain information that will make your next visit to our website more enjoyable.  You can disable or delete cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer. For information about how to control cookies, consult the “Help” portion of your internet browser or visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). 

  * Log Files



As is true of most websites, we gather information automatically, which is stored in the form of log files.  This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, and operating system, website activity, and includes how many “hits” a particular webpage is getting (a.k.a., “click-through data”). We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.  This information helps us to understand trends, view and analyze overall website activity, and evaluate and improve the website, including troubleshooting technical issues.

  * Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)



We also work with third party advertising partners that employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our websites, products, and services by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on webpages and are about the size of a period at the end of this sentence.  They cannot be disabled through your browser’s hard drive. 

We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  You may opt-out of future communications by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the promotional email.

  * Flash LSOs



We use local shared objects (LSOs), also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control or high game score, and to display content based upon what you view on our website to personalize your visit.  Third parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your website browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Our Privacy Notice does not apply to their collection and use of your information.

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data, and how that data is stored.  Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.  To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, visit <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html>.

  * HTML5



We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. 

  * Analytics



In some of our products and websites, as well as on our mobile applications, ZeniMax may generate usage, activity, and game-related statistics and other information about our user community through the use of internal, as well as third party analytics tools; some of these tools may allow us to collect and aggregate user analytics across multiple channels, including web, email and mobile. For example, we may use [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) and Google Analytics360, offered by Google Inc. (“Google”)’ [Oracle analytics](https://www.oracle.com/legal/privacy/privacy-choices.html) services, [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/legal/privacy) analytics services”) [Swrve](https://www.swrve.com/company/privacy) for mobile analytics, which collect information when you use some of our online products and services and/or play our games on your PC.  We also use other providers, and may add or amend the providers we work with at any time. We also may use third party tools to collect information regarding your interaction with us on social media sites, as well as publicly available information on social media sites that users post about us and our games and other products and services. 

These tools and technologies use cookies, log files, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and analyze certain types of information including: IP addresses; location information; browser type and language; referring URLs; platform type; click information; usage and activity logs and related data; page views (including length of time spent on a page or feature); date and time stamps; and other information about how you use our games, including game metrics and statistics, activity and usage information, and similar information.

The third party analytics companies we work with may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online products and services relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online and/or mobile products and services.  Their collection and use of information is subject to their own privacy policies.

  * Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies



In an effort to provide a safe and fair gaming environment to players of its games, and to protect against payment fraud, ZeniMax employs “anti-cheating” and fraud prevention software or applications during the use of certain online products and services to prevent fraudulent activities and behavior that may negatively affect the experiences of a player, some of which may be operated by third party providers.

ZeniMax, on its own and through third parties, may collect certain “device-identifying data” about your personal computer or mobile device, such as system information, IP address, screen resolution, device type, (e.g. PC, MAC), operating system (e.g. Windows, OS X, Linux), device time zone, MAC address, general geolocation information, and other system or network information to create a digital identifier of your device.  This information may be combined with other information from our providers who assist us in conducting these activities. 

The third parties we work with for fraud prevention may maintain the device information collected about your computer or mobile device as part of their services for other customers. 

## Push Notifications

In some mobile products, ZeniMax may send push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about the game, events, or promotions that we may be running.  If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.

## Third Party and/or Social Features

We use social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Twitter Share This button, as well as Instagram, Tumblr, YouTube, Twitch and other social media sharing buttons. These widgets buttons, features and similar interactive mini-programs run on our website or within our services, and are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

## Tell-A-Friend Feature

From time to time we may allow you to tell-a-friend about our website and we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  By providing your friend’s name and email address, you confirm that you have obtained your friend’s consent to send such email.  At your direction, we will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.  ZeniMax does not store this information and uses it for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

## Sweepstakes and Contests

We may also run contests, sweepstakes or other events or activities (collectively, “events”) on our Sites.  Information collected for these events may include personal information such as your email address and may be collected by or shared with a third party sponsor, co-sponsor, or other third party (e.g., marketing or promotional partner, contest administrator, software licensee, or game developer). While we have no control over the third party’s use of such information, our contracts with these third parties require them to agree to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of any personal information we share with them (or that they collect through our Sites).  **If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these events at the time the information is collected.**

## Third Party Advertising

We may partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other websites.  We and our ad network partners use cookies, web beacons and other tools to collect information about your activities on this and other websites, as well  as  your IP address and location information, to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests and to evaluate the success of their advertising. 

For example, we may work with Facebook (see their [privacy policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php), and [ad preferences](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads) page) to display targeted ads to you in Facebook. We may also work with others, such as Google Ads and DoubleClick (see their [privacy policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/), and [ad preferences](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated?hl=en) page), and Weborama (see their [privacy policy and opt out page](http://www.weborama.com/e-privacy/our-commitment/)), to display ads to you on other third party sites, based on your use of our products, activities on our sites and services, or other interactions with us. We may also, unless you have opted out, share certain information (such as your email address) with these and other third parties to assist them in better targeting our users within their services; you can opt-out of our sharing your personal information to target you this way by emailing us at [ads@zenimax.com](mailto:ads@zenimax.com). We will process your opt out in a reasonable amount of time; please note, that your opt out is only effective on a going-forward basis and not with respect to any information we have previously shared for these purposes. As noted above, you may also control how Google, Facebook and other third parties display certain ads to you, as explained further in their respective privacy policies and ad preferences pages.

You also may also get more information about targeted advertising, as well as opt-out of receiving targeted ads from many third-party ad networks (including Facebook and Google), through the following:

For U.S. Users:

You may also continue to receive targeted ads on other websites, from companies that do not participate in the above programs.

## Do-Not-Track Requests
