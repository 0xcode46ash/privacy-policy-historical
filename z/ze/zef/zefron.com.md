# About IUMA - Privacy Policy

|  |   


IUMA is committed to honoring the privacy and integrity of your personal information. We deeply respect your right to keep your information to yourself. But in order to provide you with services through this web site, a certain amount of your personal information is required. 

All of the information that is requested from you is used to improve the services that IUMA provides. The variety of information that we request, except for email address, is optional. It helps us to better understand our audience. We do not distribute your personal information to any third parties without your consent. 

Information collected from you may be used for the following purposes: 

**FANS**

  * We collect your credit card information, address and billing information so we may process your order and charge your account for products that you purchase. 
  * We collect information about your computer and connection speed to improve the performance and usability of our site. 
  * You need to submit your email address when you request to be on one of our mailing lists. If at any time you no longer wish to receive IUMA mailings, simply reply to the email with "unsubscribe" in the subject line and your email address will be removed from that specific list. 
  * We collect and will occasionally release aggregate demographic information about user trends to third parties, such as sales based on zip code or concerts seen in a given month by a certain user demographic. However we do not give out individual sales information unless required to do so by law.



**ARTISTS**

  * We collect information about you and your music to create your web site. Some of this information, like your biography, is displayed on your web page. Other information, like your influences and bands you sound like, is used to help fans find your music. 
  * We will always ask you before we send your information to a third party, such as a record label, etc. 



All personal information is stored in our secure databases. Access to that information is strictly controlled and limited to certain individuals within IUMA. We want to protect the integrity of your personal information that we may have in our database. If your email address changes and you would like to continue receiving any of our mailings, please notify us at [support@iuma.com](mailto:support@iuma.com) so we can update our records accordingly. 

This privacy policy is subject to change. If you have any questions about this privacy policy or any matter pertaining to the use of your personal information on this site, please email [privacy@iuma.com](mailto:privacy@iuma.com) for further information.
