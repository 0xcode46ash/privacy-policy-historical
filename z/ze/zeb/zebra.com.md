| Foreign Visitors  
---  
If you are located outside of the United States, please note that this Site is hosted on our computer servers in the United States and operated by Zebra Technologies Corporation ("Zebra U.S."). By submitting any personally identifiable information to the Site, you are transferring such information to the United States, and other jurisdictions that might not provide an equivalent level of protection as the data protection laws in your home country. Your use of the Site or submission of any personally identifiable information will therefore constitute your consent to these transfers. 

In addition, Zebra U.S. adheres to the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce (<http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>) ("EU Safe Harbor") with respect to personal data that it receives in the United States from the European Union. Specifically, Zebra may obtain such personal data in the United States about Zebra end users, distributors, or other partners ("EU Customers"), Zebra suppliers and other vendors ("EU Suppliers"), and Zebra employees ("EU Employees"). By its adherence to the Safe Harbor, Zebra offers a level of protection equivalent to that granted within the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Further information about Zebra’s EU Safe Harbor privacy practices are described in a section on EU Safe Harbor below.   
  
Active Information Collection   
---  
Personally identifiable information may be collected through the Site, including name and salutation, job title, physical address and time zone, telephone number (including work or home office, mobile, and fax numbers), e-mail address, and other contact information, and other information that is combined with your name or identifiers, such as the products or services ordered, credit/debit card and other financial and payment information, name and nature of your business, site activity data, product preference information, marketing permissions (phone, email, postal mail, fax, and SMS), language preference, password and user IDs, and delivery and fulfillment information ("Personal Information"). This Personal Information is collected where required or appropriate in connection with the purchase and delivery of Zebra® products and services, the user’s creation or maintenance of a user profile for future product ordering, to allow Zebra to contact customers when necessary in response to inquiries, to tailor the user experience, and to protect Zebra from fraud or other inappropriate conduct.  
  
Passive Information Collection  
---  
The Site may "passively" collect certain kinds of Personal Information during your visit, including through the use of:

Cookies: "Cookies" are small text files sent from a Site to the hard drive of a user's computer to store bits of information related to that user. Cookies can store information about users, including IP addresses, navigational data, server information, data transfer times, user preferences, and passwords needed to access the special areas on the Site. We use cookies for the purpose of keeping track of items in your shopping cart, to assist with the downloading of documents from the Site, to create a more personalized experience on our Site, for standard Site traffic analysis, and to improve our Site content and display. If you choose to create a user profile, we will use cookies to store the Personal Information in your profile. You may configure your Internet browser, using the "help" function, to be notified when a cookie is sent (giving you the option to decide whether to accept it or not), and to reject cookies or remove cookies. However, if you reject or remove cookies, you might not be able to access certain pages or use important functions on the Site, including downloading documents and establishing a user profile.

Other Passive Site Tracking. This Site also uses Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and log files to identify server problems, to improve site content, and compile aggregated statistics about Site usage and click-stream data. We also use Web beacons to help personalize your experience and perform standard Site traffic analysis in a manner similar to how we use cookies. In particular, Zebra utilizes, to the extent allowed under applicable law, Web Trends Analytics and Google Analytics services to track Site usage for statistical purposes. Zebra also reserves the right to introduce new passive tracking technologies and techniques related to the use of the Site, although we will do so subject to and in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations.  
  
Use and Disclosure of Information   
---  
We use, disclose, transfer and otherwise process Personal Information in several ways on the Site. When you place an order online, we use the Personal Information you provide, including the credit/debit card or payment information, to provide the products or services requested. If you create a user profile, we will store your Personal Information as requested to manage your profile. If you later decide that you do not want us to store such information, you may [contact us](https://web.archive.org/id/zebra/na/en/index/forms/en/contact_me_selections.html "Contact Me") and ask us to delete the Personal Information in your profile.

Zebra may also disclose and transfer Personal Information to resellers or distributors for marketing purposes who can provide you with further information about Zebra’s or their own products or services via phone, email, postal mail, fax and SMS. Zebra may also engage in joint offerings with its alliance and technology partners; however, Zebra will not share your Personal Information directly with such alliance and technology partners. Zebra does not conduct direct sales to end users in many situations, and therefore, depending on your location and the nature of your request, Zebra may need to share your Personal Information with its resellers and distributors in order to fulfill your request. The aforementioned resellers and distributors may be located within the EEA or elsewhere, including countries which may not offer a level of protection equivalent to the country in which you are located.

Zebra also may disclose and transfer Personal Information to IT providers, fulfillment houses, and other subcontractors that assist with the operation of the Site and/or the associated business transactions, which may be located within the EEA or elsewhere, including countries which may not offer a level of protection equivalent to the country in which you are located. All such parties will be required to keep Personal Information secure and only process it in accordance with our instructions. 

Personal Information may also, subject to the requirements of applicable law, be used, disclosed and transferred to law enforcement personnel and other persons in situations where we believe that it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal proceedings against someone who may be misusing the Site, using the Site without proper authorization, interfering with the rights of Zebra, or when Zebra reasonably believes that the law requires such disclosure. 

We may also disclose and transfer Personal Information, subject to the requirements of applicable law, where necessary or appropriate to protect the security of the Site, to protect Zebra and our affiliated companies against liability, and/or in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business. In addition, the information may be used and disclosed to verify your compliance with the Zebra Site Terms of Use.   
  
Additional Communications  
---  
Persons who submit Personal Information on the Site will be added to our internal mailing list and may be provided with product information from Zebra via email, telemarketing, fax, SMS, and postal mail, where permitted by applicable law. If you do not wish to receive such information, please [unsubscribe](https://web.archive.org/id/zebra/na/en/index/forms/en/unsubscribe_pages/unsubscribe.html "Unsubscribe: Zebra Mailing List") as described in the individual communication, or contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Statement. We will remove your name from our subscriber list within ten business days. Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Statement, Zebra does not sell or rent internal lists to other companies or vendors.  
  
Data Security  
---  
Pursuant to applicable regulations, we maintain reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. When you place orders or access your account information, we usually offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software receives encrypted information through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) of your Internet browser. Unfortunately, no information security system can be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of the Personal Information against any possible loss or unauthorized access.  
  
Access and Correction of Personal Information  
---  
If you wish to access or update the Personal Information you submit through this Site, or to make any inquiries (including requests of cancellation or opposition) about the processing of such information, please contact us as described below in the section "Contact." If you have created a [user profile](https://web.archive.org/id/zebra/na/en/index/my_profile.html "My Profile"), you may also access and revise the Personal Information in your user profile. In addition, Zebra provides individuals with access to their Personal Data where you are entitled to access and review Personal Data under applicable data protection and privacy laws.  
  
EU Safe Harbor  
---  
As noted above, Zebra U.S. adheres to the EU Safe Harbor with respect to EU Customer Data, EU Supplier Data, and EU Employee Data that Zebra receives in the United States. EU Customer Data is handled in accordance with the descriptions of the handling of Personal Information in this Privacy Statement. In addition, Zebra may obtain EU Customer Data through other authorized sources beyond this Site, such as through trade shows, business partners, and other offline resources. Zebra uses and handles such EU Customer Data for the purposes and in the manner described in this Privacy Statement.

Zebra provides its EU Employees with more detailed information about its data handling practices through internal company policies.

With respect to EU Supplier Data, Zebra obtains such data in connection with its procurement operations, including name and salutation, job title, physical address, telephone number(s), e-mail address, and other contact information, and other information that is combined with such data, including products or services provided by the supplier, performance information, and related details. Zebra uses this information in connection with its procurement activities, to protect Zebra from potential fraud, and for other legitimate business or legal compliance purposes. Individuals about whom Zebra gathers EU Supplier Data can contact Zebra to ask questions or request access, rectification, cancellation or opposition to the processing of their own personal data using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Statement. 

Individuals in the EU about whom Zebra maintains personal data in the United States may contact Zebra with any questions, or to request access to their own data, by contacting Zebra as described below. If Zebra cannot answer or resolve such questions directly, the individual concerned may contact the data protection authorities in their home country in the EU for further information.
