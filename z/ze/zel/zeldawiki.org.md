### From Zelda Wiki, the Zelda encyclopedia

[](https://web.archive.org/File:Zwlogo2dsmall.png)

All content on this site is freely distributed and open to all to edit. However, all edits are logged within the database. In addition, our site trackers collect information from you, such as screen resolution, operating system, web browser and location. We use these statistics to better the wiki in every way possible, and we never distribute this information to anybody. 

Please be reminded that if you register on the wiki, we will obviously collect additional information about you that you entered during registration. Zelda Wiki will not under any circumstances share details about its individual members with any third parties, but reserves the rights to use collected information as a basis for site demographics, which may, in given situations, be proposed to potential advertisers and sponsors. 

Do note that if you decide to post personal information (age, name, address, etc.) on your user page, you are doing so at your own risk. Zelda Wiki is not responsible for anything that occurs as a result of this information being posted, and recommends that you not reveal too much personal information. 

Zelda Wiki may not be held responsible for, or under any circumstances be associated with the opinions expressed by, the content of all editable pages, as these are community endeavors and their directions sometimes make unexpected, and inappropriate, detours from their original intent. Zelda Wiki staff, however, pledges to moderate these pages to the best of its abilities and ensure inappropriate content and opinions are not displayed on the website, as our intentions are to be a web site suitable for people of all ages. 

In a similar fashion, we cannot be held responsible or directly associated with the advertisements shown at our site, as they are served through a third party network. We will, however, do everything in our power to limit these ads to those which are suitable for people of all ages and, in the event that Zelda Wiki is informed of inappropriate advertising, certainly bring such an issue up with the advertising companies that sponsor it. 

If you have any questions regarding Zelda Wiki's privacy policies, please use the [Administrators](https://web.archive.org/Zelda_Wiki:Staff "Zelda Wiki:Staff") page to get in touch with one of Zelda Wiki's many knowledgeable owners, who will be happy to answer them for you.
