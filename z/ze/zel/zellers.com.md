Customers who choose to voluntarily opt in to receive a **hbc.com** eNewsletter will receive occasional eMails that outline store and site specials, plus other information.

 **Security**

For security of transactions, **hbc.com** uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts any information you send to us electronically.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Once **hbc.com** receives your transmission, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems.

We may also report to other organizations about improper or unlawful user activities on **hbc.com** and this reporting may include disclosure of personal information relation to those individuals conducting such improper or unlawful activities.

In addition, in order to protect you and **hbc.com** from fraudulent transactions, **hbc.com** may provide your online shopping related information to a reputable third party organization to perform address verification. This address verification is intended to ensure that the �bill to� address that you provide matches your credit card address. The third party organization does not store any personal information that **hbc.com** provide from shopping transactions.

 **hbc.com** offers membership as a value-added optional service for its visitors.

To join, **hbc.com** will request personal information such as billing and shipping address, which is then stored on our secure servers.
