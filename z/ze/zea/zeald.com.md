  * **Jointly provided services:  **In some cases we may provide services jointly with other businesses or organisations.  For such ‘co-branded’ offerings in which a third party is involved, we may share or jointly collect customer information with that third party.  In such cases we will make it clear at the outset who is collecting or receiving the information and whose privacy statement governs its use.

Also, in the event that Zeald or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, our customer information will be one of the transferred assets.  In that case, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and will give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
