Privacy Policy

Last Updated: January 20th 2004

Zeald.com has established a privacy policy to outline how it protects and manages the personal information that it collects from you (the customer) online.

  1. Consent to collect and use personal information



Your use of the Zeald.com site and/or your registration for Zeald.com products and services constitute your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Zeald.com site. 

Zeald.com may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When it does, Zeald.com will also revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. In addition, Zeald.com will seek a customer’s prior consent, by email, for any new uses or proposed disclosures of information collected from the customer prior to the change. ****Zeald.com will notify customers by email ****of changes to this policy that will affect information collected from them in the future. In certain circumstances, however, Zeald.com will not inform and obtain the consent of the customer, such as in connection with an investigation of a breach of an agreement, contravention of laws, an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual is threatened, the collection of a debt or in compliance with the request of a law enforcement agency or a court order.

A customer may withdraw his or her consent for collection, use and disclosure at any time by sending an email to unsubscribe@zeald.com. Please note that, if you do, Zeald.com may suspend its provision of products and services to you. When you unsubscribe, if you fall within the guarantee period for any Zeald.com product or service and you request a refund, the guarantee will be honoured. 

  2. Accountability



Zeald.com collects, at the time of your registration for products and services through its web site, certain “personal information” (information that personally identifies you) including but not limited to your name, email address, home or work address, telephone number, and information about your computer hardware and software ( _e.g._ , IP address, operating system, browser type, domain name, URL, access times, and referring web site addresses). 

Zeald.com has implemented this Privacy Policy to protect personal information received from its customers, and to respond to any inquiries. The Privacy Policy also provides that Zeald.com will use appropriate contractual means to establish a comparable level of protection for personal information which is sent for processing by third parties on Zeald.com’s behalf. 

  3. Purposes for Collecting Personal Information



Zeald.com collects and uses personal information for the following purposes

    1. to develop and provide our website and products and services for our customers
    2. to communicate with customers and site visitors, when necessary, and to inform customers of upgrades, as well as of other products and services available from Zeald.com, its affiliates and third parties
    3. to fulfill your requests for products, services or information
    4. to understand its customers needs
    5. to allow customers access to limited-entry areas of Zeald.com’s site
    6. to personalize some of our services and products for you and to deliver targeted advertisements and offers from Zeald.com and third parties
    7. to bill accounts and maintain payment records
    8. to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or government request
    9. to respond to a legitimate claim, or to address our reasonable belief, that you are violating the rights of any third party or any of the agreements or policies that govern your use of the Zeald.com site or any Zeald.com product or service
    10. to protect the services, products or rights of Zeald.com, including but not limited to the security or integrity of the Zeald.com site
    11. to identify and resolve technical problems concerning Zeald.com’s site, products and services.



Zeald.com also uses personal information in an aggregate form ( _i.e._ , not individually attributable to you) for its business analysis, operational, marketing and other promotional purposes.  
If we hire other companies to provide some products or services on our behalf, then we will only provide those companies the personal information they need for the Identified Purposes, and we will limit their rights to use and further disclose your personal information as appropriate in the course of their work for us.

  4. Limiting Collection of Personal Information



Zeald.com limits its collection of personal information to only that information which is necessary for the Identified Purposes

  5. Disclosure, Processing and Retention



Zeald.com does not sell, rent or disclose your personal information to anyone else, except:

    1. to someone you have designated to act as your agent, for one or more of the Identified Purposes (listed in Section 2, above)
    2. to Zeald.com’s employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, consultants, business associates, service providers, suppliers and agents, acting on Zeald.com’s behalf for any of the Identified Purposes
    3. as necessary if Zeald.com has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with Zeald.com’s rights or property, other users of Zeald.com’s web site, products or services, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities
    4. to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law



In addition, as we continue to develop our business, we may sell or buy other businesses or entities, or we may merge with another company. In such transactions, personal information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that Zeald.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets.

Your information may be stored and processed in New Zealand, or in any other country in which Zeald.com or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. By using this web site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. 

After your account becomes inactive (that is, if you request to be removed from our database), Zeald.com will keep your personal information in its archives. Your information will then be used only as necessary for tax reasons or to prove Zeald.com’s compliance with any applicable law.

  6. Accuracy of Personal Information



Zeald.com will use reasonable efforts to keep customer personal information accurate for the Identified Purposes, and for minimizing the possibility of making inappropriate customer decisions based on such information. Customers are responsible for informing Zeald.com about changes to their personal information. You can do this by calling +64 9 415 7575 or sending an email to privacy@zeald.com. Zeald.com will use new or updated personal information it receives from customers to update its own records.
