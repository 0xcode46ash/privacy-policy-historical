Our web server collects IP addresses to obtain certain aggregate information concerning the use of our website. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information. Therefore you can remain anonymous when you visit our website.   
Our web servers also collect information such as number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc., but this information is not traceable back to an individual user. ZWSOFT uses this information to analyze how people use our site and generate ideas on how the site might be improved.   
Some of our web pages utilize "cookies" so that we can better serve you with tailored information when you return to our site.

This website contains links to websites owned and maintained by other companies. Such websites may also collect personal information and such collection of personal information will be subject to the privacy policies of the site and company at which it is collected. 

Information Collected via Marketing Activities   
ZWSOFT conducts many different marketing activities by which it may collect your personal information. For example, we collect contact information at trade shows, we rent email and physical mail addresses for marketing campaigns, we invite the public to download free software from our website in return for providing us contact information, we run contests for which participants provide basic information on registration, and we obtain addresses from publications that target the industries from which we hope to attract customers. When we rent lists of names and addresses, we rent them from entities that provide only names of individuals who have "opted in" to receive communications from companies such as ZWSOFT and we typically do not receive the actual contact information but only the ability to send an email or mail to the contact from a bonded mailhouse. 

Information Collected via License Activation and/or License Registration   
At the time customers register or activate their license of ZWCAD and/or ZW3D, ZWSOFT collects information such as Company name, shipping address, contact name, contact email address, telephone number, title, role, products designed, primary CAD product in use and industry sector. ZWSOFT requests this information because it believes it is important to understand who its customers are and how to contact them with relevant product information. In some circumstances, ZWSOFT may be obligated to make this information available to third parties who license to ZWSOFT technology that is included in the products being activated. If ZWSOFT receives an inquiry from a person at the licensee company as to which individual at the company has activated a given license, ZWSOFT will supply the contact name in response to enable the company to understand where its licenses are being used. 

The Use of Personal Information   
ZWSOFT may use the personal information you provide us for a variety of purposes, including registration, authentication, and marketing. We may use the information to inform you of special offers, contests, upgrades, and other ZWSOFT products and services that may be of interest to you. When you are a customer of ZWSOFT products or services, we may use your personal information to contact you for a wide array of customer relation/customer service purposes, such as to inquire whether you intend to renew subscription service agreements or other contracts with ZWSOFT or to request that you respond to a survey concerning our products and services or to address a question regarding an order.   
Since ZWSOFT resellers are our primary sales channel and provide the first line of support to our customers, we share personal contact information with the reseller assigned to a particular customer or prospect.   
We may also provide you with materials concerning the products and/or services of other third parties we think may be of interest to you. We may do this by emailing information to you or providing your name and address to a bonded mailhouse that mails information on behalf of a third party. The bonded mailhouse is prohibited from providing the third party with your name and contact information and is obligated to either return the information to us or destroy the list following the mailing. Unless we inform you otherwise at the point at which we collect your information, we will not provide your personal contact information directly to a third party not otherwise described herein. If you do not wish to receive information about additional ZWSOFT products or services or those of its partners and other companies, please let us know (contact information below) and we will respect your wishes. Emails we distribute describing offers we think may be of interest to you also contain instructions as to how you can opt-out of future emails.   
ZWSOFT stores the personal data of web site visitors and customers indefinitely and may maintain and process such information directly or indirectly in one or more databases in the United States and elsewhere. We may hire other companies to provide services on our behalf that may involve the storage and use of your personal information, such as for delivering mailings or emails. Any such company or third party is required to maintain the confidentiality of that information and is prohibited from using that information for any purpose other than as authorized by us. If you provide personal information to ZWSOFT, you agree and consent to the storage and usage of this information anywhere that ZWSOFT and its affiliates maintain offices (around the world), for a variety of purposes, including those described above. ZWSOFT may also disclose such personal information if required by law or if ZWSOFT believes in good faith that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (for example, a warrant or subpoena or other court order) or protect the rights, property or personal safety of ZWSOFT, our customers or the public.

If you wish to purchase items (including software, books, or branded marketing merchandise) or services (e.g., certification training) from the site, we require your personal information such as your full name, billing address, telephone number, email address, and credit card number/expiration date. Collection and processing of information related to this purchase activity may be conducted by a third party fulfillment house that is obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the information. In certain circumstances, a third party is acting as a reseller of the items and is independently responsible for protecting your information. Please read carefully such vendors' Privacy Policies before providing your personal data. ZWSOFT may access personal information collected by the third party vendor in order to better understand the products of interest to its customers. ZWSOFT may use this information to notify you of other products or services it believes may be of interest to you.   
ZWSOFT works to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We may also store information regarding your purchase (not credit card information but information as to what you ordered and whether and when it was fulfilled and your contact information) in order to answers questions and resolve issues that may arise later.   
At the time the order is placed we may ask you to "opt in" for further contact regarding such things as sales and special offers and we may contact you following that "opt in" permission. If you opt in we may also share your information with other companies and organizations whose products we think may be of interest to you so that they may contact you. If you do not opt in we will not contact you regarding other offers, but please be aware that if you have given us your personal information pursuant to other ZWSOFT marketing activities, we may contact you.
