Privacy Policy

Because Clear Channel is firmly committed to providing quality entertainment in a trusted environment and respecting your privacy, we have prepared this Privacy Policy to disclose our information collection, utilization, and dissemination practices for this Web site. Any questions or comments about this policy should be directed to the [www.z100.com](http://www.z100.com/) site coordinator at [webmaster@z100.com](mailto:webmaster@z100.com). 

**Introduction**

Our central objective is to provide exceptional value to the listeners of Z100 and our Web site visitors. We believe that we will be commercially successful if we provide you with useful information and entertainment and reward your loyalty to us by offering super values on station merchandise, music, and other products we can help you buy well. 

We want to build on the loyal relationship [www.z100.com](http://www.z100.com/) has with its listeners by using the Internet to create stronger relationships. Holding up our end of the bargain begins with respecting your privacy. You will define the relationship. As you choose to share your interests and preferences with us, we will be able to make your online experience with us more enjoyable and relevant. 

  * If you choose to provide us with personal information, we will be better able to reciprocate by providing you a more personalized experience over time. But, it's your choice. And, we will protect your privacy as explained in this policy. 
  * If you want we will contact you regularly by e-mail and on your personalized screen about the subjects you tell us are of interest to you - station events, music news, sports, whatever. 
  * The more you visit the easier it will be for us to make the content and presentation of [www.z100.com](http://www.z100.com/) increasingly relevant to your interests.
  * We will encourage you to participate with us in improving [www.z100.com](http://www.z100.com/).
  * We will ask you to tell us what you like and what we should add or change. If you don't want to participate, just tell us. 
  * If you request that we not contact you for marketing purposes, we will not. However, if you are interested, we may keep you informed of special offers on products and services that we have negotiated on behalf of our visitors. We may try to use the group buying power of our visitors to help negotiate special offers from potential marketing partners. 
  * [www.z100.com](http://www.z100.com/) will be totally "you-centric" while being your port of entry to the Internet. We can only protect your privacy while you are on [www.z100.com](http://www.z100.com/). When you choose to explore other venues on the Internet, you may be subjected to different treatment. Our recommendation as you explore would be to ensure you receive good value in return for the value you provide to others.
