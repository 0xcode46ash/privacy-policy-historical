# ZYRTEC® (cetirizine HCl) - Privacy Statement

## Privacy Statement

### Internet privacy policy

Pfizer Inc. recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of information we may collect from our online visitors. To this end, we are committed to using our best efforts to respect the privacy of our online visitors. It is our intent to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using information received from and about you with your reasonable expectations of privacy. The following is the way we handle information learned about you from your visit to our Web site.

### Collective data

Some Pfizer Inc. Web sites deposit certain bits of information called cookies in a visitor’s computer. Cookies are sent back only to the Web site that deposited them when a visitor returns to that site. Cookies can tell us how and when pages in a Web site are visited and by how many people. This technology does not collect personally identifiable information; the information collected is in an aggregate, nonidentifiable form. With the information we can learn through this technology, we hope to improve our sites.

### Personally identifiable information

Pfizer collects personally identifiable information, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and the like, only when voluntarily provided by a Web site visitor. We will notify you as to the uses we intend to make of that information.

### Links to other sites

As a resource to our visitors, Pfizer provides links to other Web sites. We try to carefully choose Web sites we believe are useful and meet our high standards. However, because Web sites can change so quickly, we can’t guarantee the standards of every Web site link we provide or be responsible for the content of non-Pfizer sites.

### Children

We do not specifically collect information about children. We do ask parents if their children have allergies and children’s birthdates.

### Changes

Any changes to this privacy policy will be communicated promptly on this page.
