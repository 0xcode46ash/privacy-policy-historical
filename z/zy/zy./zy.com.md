At ZyWeb we believe that strong electronic privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of the Internet as a service, commercial, and entertainment medium, but we do need to understand our members' behaviour in order to develop the most appropriate tools for you. To achieve this goal, we need to understand what makes our members different which is why we collect information when you complete our registration form. 

**Registration**

ZyWeb gathers information about Members that allows us to offer compelling services and easily accessible online content in a manner that provides personal privacy protection as well. When you join ZyWeb we ask you to provide us information such as your first and last name, email address, geographical location and how you came to join us. We ask these questions in case we need to verify your identity for security purposes. 

**Use of Information**

Any information you provide to ZyWeb when registering for our services is maintained and accessible only by ZyWeb unless you elect to join any of our partner services at which point your details will be passed to these carefully selected partners who will also strive to maintain your privacy. Every member who joins any ZyWeb service can freely choose not to join any of our partner services and as a result the personal information submitted will not be passed to any of our partners. 

We analyse general browsing habits with a view to presenting you with the most relevant and valuable information and services. We develop summary - not individual \- reports for advertisers (who make it possible for you to use ZyWeb services for free) to determine the effectiveness of their advertising investments. We never tell advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements. 

Except as described in this Privacy statement, ZyWeb will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process (such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant), in circumstances where ZyWeb in its sole discretion, deems appropriate at the request of law enforcement officials, or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

**Sharing of Information**

Except as described in this Privacy statement, ZyWeb will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer's permission. The individually identifiable information that you provide will be used extensively within the ZyWeb to provide a personalized experience to you. 

**Correcting and Updating**

You can correct or modify your password, E-mail address and other personal information by first signing-in and then selecting "User Info" from your Filestore, once you have amended your details simply click "Save" to update our records and return to your Filestore. 

Any questions regarding this policy should be directed to [webmaster@zyweb.com](mailto:andrew@zynet.net).
