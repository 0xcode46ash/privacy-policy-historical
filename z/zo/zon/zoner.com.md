Zoner Privacy Policy

**What information does Zoner request? And for whom?**   
  
Whenever you place an order, download an evaluation, or join a discussion list, we ask for your contact/billing information which is used for internal operations and to provide you with updated information on our products. We may forward your contact information to a registered Zoner value-added reseller who may contact you. Other than for this purpose, we do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We may also be required by law to disclose certain information. 

**Where do you store my personal information? Can I ask you to remove it?**   
  
Users receive information from Zoner, either on paper or by e-mail. Every user can, of course, request immediate removal of his/her record from our databases, by sending an e-mail to: [remove@zoner.com](mailto:remove@zoner.com). If, however, you are removed from our database, we can no longer send you information on patches to Zoner applications you own nor on new versions of our programs. If you would like to have your contact information changed, please send us your request at: [register@zoner.com](mailto:register@zoner.com)

Our site does not use "cookies" (information stored about you, for our site, on your computer).

**Is my information secure?**   
  
When you send us your personal info, this information transfer is secured using SSL. Zoner has a [Thawte](http://www.thawte.com/) SSL certificate.
