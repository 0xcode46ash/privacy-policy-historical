ECHOVOX may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in
response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law
enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action
regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any
person, violations of our terms of use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing ZONG website
