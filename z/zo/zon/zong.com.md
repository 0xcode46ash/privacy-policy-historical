#### For end-users

To ensure the good performance and proper functionality of the ZONG service, ZONG may use your personal information (mainly phone number, email, wireless network or financial information) to process and monitor the payment, billing and if needed, communication and support. We will also use the information to market PayPal services to you. You will be able to unsubscribe from any such mailings.

### Registration

To access the Developer Network on the Web site or ZONG services, ZONG may request certain personal information. 

#### For publishers or developers

To access the Developer Network, we require you to create a user name and password. On the registration form, ZONG may request certain personally identifiable information from you. During registration, you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. 

#### For end-users

There is no need for you to register phone numbers for our payment service as these numbers are already pre-registered with the mobile network operators. When you choose to make a payment, you insert your phone number on the payment console and ZONG may send you a payment confirmation via the wireless network you have subscribed to. 

###  Service-related Announcements

We will send developers and publishers strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. 

### Newsletters

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section. 

###  Agents/Service Providers 

We use other third parties such as an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf and an online survey provider to conduct anonymous surveys on our site. When you sign up for our newsletter or participate in our surveys, we will share your email as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes. 

###  Customer Service 

Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes. 

###  Wireless Network Providers and Messaging Systems

We use wireless networks to process your payments so that you see charges on your monthly phone bill. When you choose to make a payment, you insert your phone number on the payment console and ZONG may send you a payment confirmation via the wireless network you have subscribed to. ZONG may inform the wireless network providers of their respective subscribers who made payments through the console so as to include charges on their bills. 

As part of our payment flow, end-users of the payment console will receive text messages containing your Personal Identification Number (PIN), payment confirmation, etc. via Short Message Service (SMS). If you purchase applications, wallpapers or ringtones, you will receive your mobile content via Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS). The phone numbers are being stored in ZONG to monitor your payment status mainly for customer support. As explained earlier, the Personal Information you provided us will not be shared, sold, rented, or traded to any third party except as described in this privacy policy without your prior consent.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.

### Cookies 

A cookie is a piece of information that is deposited by the ZONG computer server when you visit ZONG Web site which is stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser. On revisiting ZONG Web site, the ZONG' server will recognize the cookies, giving ZONG information about your last visit. At your option, we link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site so as to enhance your experience. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. 

We set a persistent cookie to store your mobile numbers which allows our application to prefill your mobile number so that you do not have to enter it in future sessions. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but usually you can alter the settings of your browser to prevent automatic acceptance. 

We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. These services track traffic volume and site statistics that are not linked to personally identifiable information. The use of cookies by our tracking utility company and other trusted partners is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

Every time you connect to ZONG's Web site, web server logs will be stored which show your IP address (the unique number which your machine uses when it is connected to the Internet); what you looked at; whether the page request was successful or not, and which browser you used to view the pages. The use of this data is strictly for statistical purposes and personalization purposes only. This helps ZONG understand where you come from, which areas of the site are of particular interest and also which pages are not being requested. We link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to help combat fraud, improve security and provide localized content and instructions in the language native to that country. 

### Choice and Opt-out

We will not share, sell, rent or trade your personal information in ways incompatible with the ones described above without providing you a choice. We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at privacy@zong.com.
