The following statement explains our information-gathering and dissemination practices for our site (the "Site") on the World Wide Web.

We have established the following guiding principles for our privacy policy and practices: 

**Principle 1.** Zone Labs lets you visit the Site without revealing any information about yourself. We do, however, keep track of the domains from which people visit us on the World Wide Web, and log IP addresses for statistical purposes to identify trends and the results of our marketing efforts in aggregate. IP addresses are not linked to "Personally Identifiable Information" (see below). We also use this information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site.

**Principle 2.** Some Zone Labs products ask you for "Personally Identifiable Information" as part of the registration process, including your connection type and number of computers. You choose whether or not to provide this information without affecting the product's performance. If you choose to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information, we use this information to notify you about product upgrades, updates, and new products. Zone Labs keeps your Personally Identifiable Information confidential and does not sell, trade or exchange mailing lists with any organization. Zone Labs maintains this information for not less than two but not more than four years, and will only disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties if acting under good faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to legal requirements; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Zone Labs; or (3) enforce the Zone Labs Terms of Service.

**Principle 3.** Zone Labs will not send you any unsolicited information, including email, except where you authorize us to do so.

**Principle 4.** At your request, Zone Labs will change or delete your information and not use it for further contact with you. To request that your information be changed or deleted and not used for further contact with you, please e-mail us at [privacy@zonelabs.com](mailto:privacy@zonelabs.com) or write to us at Attn: Privacy Contact, Zone Labs, Inc., 1060 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94103.

**Principle 5.** Zone Labs collects and uses information that can be divided into the following categories:   
Registration Information: This is information that you provide during the ZoneAlarm or ZoneAlarm Pro product registration download process. You provide your first and last name, email address, and information about your use of ZoneAlarm or ZoneAlarm Pro. 

_Personally Identifiable Information_ : This is optional information that you may choose to provide to us. If you choose to provide Personally Identifiable Information, we will only use this information to notify you about product upgrades, product updates and new products. In addition, internal security provides that this information is coded with restricted access, and our servers are kept in a secure, locked environment.

Digital River keeps your credit card information confidential and protects your credit card information through the use of industry-standard Secure Sockets (SSL) encryption technology. 

_Use of Information for Analyzing Security Breaches_ : If the Zone Labs product detects a security threat to your computer, you can click on the "More Information" button from the product dialogue box. At that point, the product sends the information about the threat and your IP address to the Zone Labs Site to be analyzed. Zone Labs will send you more specific guidance about the security information. Zone Labs will not release your IP address or any Personally Identifiable Information that could be extracted from your IP address to any third party.
