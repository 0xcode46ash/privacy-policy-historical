Zoë's Kitchen USA, LLC ("Zoë's" or "We" or "Us") is committed to protecting the privacy of customers visiting the Zoë's Kitchen website, www.zoeskitchen.com (the "Site").  The purpose of this Zoë's Kitchen USA, LLC Website Privacy Policy (the "Policy") is to explain what information Zoë's collects from you when you visit the Site and how Zoë's uses that information. 

**What information is collected?**

Zoë's only collects personally identifiable information, such as your first and last name, mailing address, email address, and phone number, when you voluntarily submit it.  For example, personally identifiable information will be requested from you when you register for our Zoë's Catering Incentive Program, when you apply for a job on-line, when you apply for a franchise, or when you provide feedback to Us via the Site.  We use this information to process your requests and provide you with the desired information, and we may at times provide you with other related information about our business.  We retain the information for as long as it is needed for the purpose it was collected. 

In addition to your personally identifiable information, Zoë's also gathers tracking information such as your IP address, operating system, and browser type.  We do not collect any personally identifiable information from you in this manner.  We use the aggregate information to better serve you by continually improving the content of our website. 

**How is the information used?**

Zoë's may share your personally identifiable information with Zoë's franchisees, subsidiaries, and affiliates (the "Zoë's Affiliates").  All Zoë's Affiliates will be informed of the terms of this Policy and required to comply with such terms. 

Zoë's may disclose your personally identifiable information as required for implementation of our Zoë's Catering Incentive Program, including disclosing such information to the third parties with whom program participants can redeem their Zoë's Incentive Dollars.

Other than these uses, Zoë's does not share, sell or trade any of your personally identifiable information to third parties without your permission.  However, Zoë's reserves the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the Site, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an investigation on a matter of public safety. 

**Use of Cookies:**

"Cookies" are pieces of information that a website places on an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.  Cookies allow the Site to remember important information that will make your use of the Site more convenient, and may be associated with personally identifiable information.  Currently, the Site uses cookies only in conjunction with franchise applications, but that use may be expanded in the future. 

**Links to other sites:**

We may offer links to other sites that are not operated by Zoë's.  If you visit one of these linked sites, you should review its privacy and other policies.  We are not responsible for the policies and practices of other companies, and any information you submit to those companies is subject to their privacy policies. 

**What is the policy regarding children?**

Zoë's does not specifically solicit or collect information about children, but We are concerned about the safety of children and their use of the Internet.  We will not knowingly request or solicit personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.  In the event that We receive actual knowledge that Zoë's has collected such personally identifiable information without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, We will delete that information from our database as quickly as is practical.  

**Third Party Hosting:**

Zoë's contracts with one or more third parties to maintain and host the Site.  Therefore, any information you submit, including personally identifiable information, will be placed and stored on a computer server maintained by this third party.  Your use of the Site and any provision of personally identifiable information you submit to the Site constitutes your acknowledgement that such information or content could pass through and may be stored in servers outside the control of Zoë's.  You agree that Zoë's has no liability or responsibility for any such pass through or storage of the same. 

**How will I be notified of changes to this privacy statement?**
