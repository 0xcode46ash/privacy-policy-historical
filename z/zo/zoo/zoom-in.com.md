# Magnet Media Privacy Policy

> > **Privacy Policy Information Collection and Use**  
>  Magnet Media is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. Magnet Media does not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Magnet Media collects information from users at several different points on this website.
>> 
>> **Registration**  
>  Some portions of this website require a user to first complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information and unique identifiers, but encouraged so Magnet Media can provide a more personalized experience.
>> 
>> **Cookies**  
>  A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use Magnet Media, but will be limited in some areas of the site. Some of Magnet Media's business partners use cookies (for example, advertisers). However, Magnet Media has no access to or control over these cookies.
>> 
>> **Log Files**  
>  Magnet Media uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
>> 
>> **Sharing**  
>  Magnet Media may share aggregated demographic information with partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
>> 
>> Magnet Media partners with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, Magnet Media will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.

>  If a user wishes to subscribe to the newsletter, Magnet Media asks for contact information such as name and email address.
>> 
>> **Surveys + Contests**  
>  From time-to-time Magnet Media requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

>> **Tell-A-Friend**  
>  If a user elects to use the referral service for informing a friend about our site, Magnet Media will ask them for the friend's name and email address. Magnet Media will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Magnet Media stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.
