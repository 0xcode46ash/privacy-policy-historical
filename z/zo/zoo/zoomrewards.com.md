Incentive Logic, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for our web sites [www.incentivelogic.com] and [points.ugive.com] as hosted by Incentive Logic, Inc. 

## Data Collection Usage

Incentive Logic provides this points program as a service to MarketTools. During the process of collecting contact information from Folio/reward recipients, names, email addresses, shipping addresses and phone numbers are collected. 

All contact information collected during the shipping information data gathering process is used to facilitate orders (i.e., to get in touch with a reward recipient when necessary for fulfilling a Folio order). The contact, demographic and profiling information we collect from you may also be used to improve and customize the content of our site. This information is NOT shared with outside organizations for commercial purposes. 

This information may also become the property of MarketTools and is subject to their privacy policy as provided on their site. As a vendor to the sponsor, Incentive Logic takes its role very seriously. We will not sell, rent or give your personally identifiable information to anyone other than MarketTools. 

Additionally, we may share your information under the following conditions: 

  * We have your consent. 
  * We need to provide your information to an Incentive Logic vendor who is working on our behalf to deliver your selected item to you. 
  * We are responding to a subpoena, court order, or other legal process. 



## IP Addresses

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site. In the Internet Protocol (IP), an IP address is a 32-bit number that identifies each sender or receiver's system. 

## Cookies

For each visitor, we may create a browser cookie that we use to keep track of your visits to our web site and to help our site run more smoothly. No private information is stored through our use of Cookies. While Cookies enhance your experience at an Incentive Logic web site, they are not required to facilitate an order. A cookie is a coded piece of information, stored on your computer, that can be used to identify your computer during the current and subsequent visits to a web site. 

## Security

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Incentive Logic makes every effort to ensure that the information you provide when ordering is protected while you use our site. 

Your Points Program account information is password protected for your privacy and security. You may edit this information at any time. However, please use all appropriate measures to protect your password. The protection of each password remains the responsibility of the respective account holder. 

Incentive Logic may amend or edit this policy from time to time. If we make any major changes in the way in which we use your personal information we will post a notice to that effect on the Points Program Web site. 

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Incentive Logic does not own or control, or to people that Incentive Logic does not employ or manage.
