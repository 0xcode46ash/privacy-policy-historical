## INFORMATION COLLECTION

When you fill out the ZoomPanel registration questionnaire, we gather your contact and demographic information such as email address, age, gender, postal address and zip code. We track this information so that we can send you surveys that are appropriate for or relevant to you. We try to ask your opinions about products and services with which you are familiar and that are readily available where you live.

We also need to know about you so that we can ensure that a broad group of people is given the opportunity to respond to each survey. Often, the survey group must represent the diverse population comprised of specific geographic regions or age groups.

### LOG FILES

When you visit the ZoomPanel website (the "Site"), or participate in a survey, we gather certain information about your computer automatically and store it in log files. This information includes, but is not limited to, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring and exiting pages, operating system, screen resolution, color capabilities, date and time stamp, click stream data, and information regarding which JavaScript version your computer has and whether your computer is enabled for Flash® and ActiveX. We tie personal information to logged information to (1) prevent abuse of our system, (b) track clicks and (c) ensure completion of the registration process.

## DATA PROCESSING, VERIFICATION AND SUPPLEMENTATION

Periodically, we may send your information to third-party data processors for data verification, supplementation or other processing. Data verification involves the use of third-party data processing services to standardize and clean your provided profile information so that it is easily identified and accessed in our database. Data supplementation involves appending any publicly available information about you to your personal profile.

On occasion, ZoomPanel may send the information we gather about you to other trusted third-party data processors to organize, process and/or analyze the data on our behalf. For instance, we use such services to ensure that your opt-out requests are honored and we use other such services to send surveys to those of you participating in our mobile panel.

All such third-party data processors are (a) prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to ZoomPanel and (b) contractually bound to observe this ZoomPanel privacy policy to ensure that the confidentiality of your personal information will be maintained.

We may share your non-personally identifiable information collected via surveys in aggregate and anonymous form with our clients. For example, we may let a client know that female survey respondents aged 25-34 preferred product A over product B. We do not disclose your first name, last name, postal address, email address or any other personally identifiable information to these third parties unless you provide us with your express consent.
