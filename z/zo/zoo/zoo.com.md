# Zoo - Privacy Policy

last updated: August 29, 2006

Zoo makes searching the Internet easy by bringing together results from the best search engines and content providers around. Using Zoo to search the web gets you results from Google, Yahoo!, and Wikipedia. When you search using the news tab, you see the latest from ABC, Fox and Yahoo! News. InfoSpace, Inc. owns and operates Zoo. We urge kids to check with their parents before entering information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know. Zoo is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Protection Act of 1998. 

Please note that this policy only applies to our data collection and use practices for this website (www.zoo.com) (the "Site") and the services we provide through the Site (collectively, the "Services"), and does not apply to the data collection and use practices of other companies or organizations whose products, services or Web sites you may use or gain access through the Site and Services. For InfoSpace's general policies and practices regarding information collection and use, please visit InfoSpace's general corporate website at [www.infospaceinc.com](http://www.infospaceinc.com/) and review its corporate [privacy policy](http://www.infospaceinc.com/about/legal_privacy.php).

At Zoo, it's our policy to provide a website search experience that requires minimum collection of information from our visitors. Generally, we limit our collection of information from Zoo to what is known as non-personally identifiable information. When a user visits Zoo we collect anonymous (i.e. non-personally identifying) information that the user's browser makes available, such as the originating Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and operating system, the date and time of the visit, the duration and activity of the visit and the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the referring and exiting Web sites. We generally use log files to collect and store this anonymous user information. We use this information for a variety of purposes, including the administration and operation of our Web sites and other properties, designing and developing new products and services and generally improving the overall quality of the user's experience. We do not require users to share personally-identifiable information, such as name or email address, in order to use the search services of Zoo. 

From time to time, however, we may request or users may otherwise voluntarily provide us information that may personally identify the user (e.g. email address and/or email address of parent or third party), as explained below, in order to allow the user to share information and interests with others and offer and conduct other online activities (e.g. tell-a-friend service). We do not condition a user's participation in any of the online activities on Zoo on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. When we request personal information from you, we will inform you of the type of information we need and the purpose of our use. We only use personal information we receive for the purpose it was collected.

Zoo allows users to send information about services and products available on the Site to others that may be interested, and from time to time will send, on behalf of users who request it, email messages to family and/or friends to let family and/or friends share their interests. If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about Zoo, we ask for the user's first name and friend's email address and automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit Zoo. We do not require users to submit personally identifiable information about themselves in order to send an electronic postcard or for Zoo to send email messages to family or friends, and we do not store the information related to the friends and the one-time email sent pursuant to the user's input will be our only contact with that person for such input. 

Zoo may also provide the opportunity to feedback to us. In doing so, we do not request personally identifiable information. 

All information collected for electronic postcards and email messages is used only to send the requested electronic postcard or email message and is deleted from our system once the electronic postcard, email message or email response is sent.

When you visit Zoo one or more cookies, web beacons or action tags may be sent to your computer or otherwise used in connection with your visit or use by InfoSpace and its third party service providers. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your computer by a Web site when you visit. When stored on your computer, a cookie uniquely identifies your browser and records your preferences and other data about your visit. Cookies are also sometimes used to complete transactions requested by users. Web beacons, also known as web bugs, are small, graphic images that transparently reside on a Web site or other web-based service and are designed to allow the Web site or service owner to monitor who is visiting the Web site or using the service. Action tags assist in delivering cookies and embed a random identifying number on a user's browser. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For a session cookie, once you close your browser the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie stays stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can change the settings on your browser to refuse or notify you prior to accepting cookies and to remove them from your computer. However, some features, products and services may not function properly without cookies. 

We do not store any personal information into cookies nor do we link or combine information collected through cookies to any personal information that users submit online to us through Zoo. We use information collected from cookies and web beacons to provide you with personalized features and preferences, and to track which pages our users view, which browsers they use and other information about user activity when visiting the Site or using the Services.

In general, we only use any personal information collected from Zoo for the purpose it was collected, including providing the Site and Services, sending the electronic postcards and email messages as requested on behalf of the user.

We may internally transfer the information we collect, including your personal information, to and from the United States and any other country in which we or our agents maintain facilities for the purposes identified above, as well as for storage, processing or other business use as permitted under this Privacy Policy. By accessing or using the Site or otherwise using the Services, you consent to the transfer of your personal information among these facilities, including those located outside of your country of residence.

In general, we do not sell, rent or otherwise trade your personal information with third parties. However, we may disclose and share your personal information with third parties under the following limited circumstances:  


  *  **Consent.** We have received valid consent or permission from the user.
  *  **Third Party Service Providers.** Occasionally, we engage third parties to provide us with products and services, such as advertisements, support, consulting, statistical analysis and marketing research. In general, we only share anonymous information with such third parties for purposes of receiving their services or for analysis and improvement of our site, and these third parties do not collect any personally identifiable information. For example, we use third party advertising companies that collect anonymous information about your visits to and interaction with our site as part of their service serving advertisements to our site. In the event we share any of your personal information with any such third party service provider, the third party will be obligated to only use such information for the limited purpose of providing us with their specific product or service and to maintain the privacy of any such personal information disclosed or shared. For more information about the information collection practices of some of our third party service providers, please visit [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).
  *  **Business Transfers.** Information about our users is one of our most important business assets. As such, information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed and transferred as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide Infospace products and services, the sale or pledge of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets.
  *  **Protection of Infospace; Compliance with Law.** We will disclose personal information or remove, destroy or alter personal information in our possession or control when we believe it is necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, its employees, customers or the public.



Zoo uses and provides access to products, services and content of third parties (collectively, **"Third Party Properties"** ), such as third party links and advertisements. Please be aware that we do not control and are not responsible for the information collection and use practices and policies of these third parties, and that by accessing or using Third Party Properties they may collect information regarding your use and access. In general, links on the Site, whether part of a listing, advertisement or other content, only collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information about your browser and activity. However, we encourage you to be aware when you use a Third Party Property or leave the Site and to review any third party's data and information collection and use practices and policies with regard to their own Web site, products or services.

We have implemented and use a variety of industry accepted physical, electronic and managerial policies and procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect to help prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction and to maintain its accuracy and correct use. We generally store the information and data we collect on our own servers in a secure environment and restrict access to your personal information to employees and agents who need to know that information in order to provide you with access and use of the Site or other Infospace properties, operate and maintain the Infospace properties and as otherwise set forth and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. While we have taken efforts to safeguard and secure your personal information, we cannot guarantee that your information may not be disclosed, altered or destroyed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.

The user has the choice of whether or not to provide us with personal information, and it is not necessary to provide us with personal information to use the search services available on Zoo. Unless the cost, burden or expense of such access is unwarranted, or the rights of a third party would be violated, we provide the user with the ability to access, correct, update and/or delete the user personal information we collect and store. To do so, please contact us at the contact information provided below.

At Zoo, our goal is to help parents ensure that their kids have a safe and fun online experience. That's why we've set up a system by which parents can print out and mail or fax us a signed form that allows them to review any identifiable information collected about their child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of their child's information. See Zoo Parental Information Request Form Below. Zoo takes steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child and to ensure that the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian. 

Questions regarding children's privacy should be directed to us at the contact information provided below.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, please direct them to us at the contact information provided below. We have instituted internal policies and procedures for handling such submissions and will respond to you in a timely manner.

We will change, amend and update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our privacy practices, technology, products and services, general business operations and industry. In the event of any such change, we will post a revised policy on this Web site and revise the "Last Updated" date of the policy. We reserve the right to change, amend and update this Privacy Policy at any time in our sole and absolute discretion, and such changes will be effective upon posting of the revised policy. In the event of a material change in our information collection and use practices, we will provide more prominent notice of such change along with the revision to the effective date of the policy. You should check this Privacy Policy on a regular basis to ensure you have reviewed and are familiar with the most current policy.
