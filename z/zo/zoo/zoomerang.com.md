Your privacy is important to us. MarketTools, Inc., through our Zoomerang service, has created this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect when you visit our www.zoomerang.com site, why we collect it and how it is used. 

In this policy, the terms “User” and “you” refer to the user/subscriber utilizing our www.zoomerang.com site. The terms “MarketTools,” “Zoomerang,” and “we” refer to MarketTools, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates. This Privacy Policy is governed by our [ Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20050519012306id_/http%3A//info.zoomerang.com/about/toa.htm). By using this web site, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

Please be aware that this Privacy Policy and the choices you make on this web site will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to MarketTools in the context of other, separately operated, MarketTools products or services.  
  
**What is Zoomerang?**  
Zoomerang is a survey clearinghouse. Zoomerang is committed to its policy of protecting the privacy and confidential information of our Users, who register to build and deploy surveys and who from time to time might purchase services offered by Zoomerang. We are also committed to protecting the privacy of people who register to respond to surveys (“Panelists”). For Panelists, please also refer to the ZoomPanel Privacy Policy at http://www.zoompanel.com. 

Our www.zoomerang.com site allows our Users to create surveys and questionnaires for distribution to potential survey respondents. Our Terms of Use require that, prior to sending a survey, Users must have an ongoing business or personal relationship with a survey recipient, or the User must have obtained the prior consent of a survey recipient to send emails to a recipient through our site. Our Terms of Use also require the User who is sending a survey invitation or a survey to take full responsibility for its subject matter and contents. Questions? Please refer to our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20050519012306id_/http%3A//info.zoomerang.com/about/toa.htm).  
  
**What Personally Identifiable Information does Zoomerang collect and what does Zoomerang do with it?**  
"Personally Identifiable Information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, email address, phone number, or other contact information, whether at work or at home. 

Upon registration, we ask our Users to provide us with certain Personally Identifiable Information such as their name, country of residence and email address. We use this information to establish individual accounts and lockers, protected by a password, that the User selects. In addition, we use the email address supplied by the User in the registration process to confirm registration, and to send notices and updates to the User concerning the services and the site. We will also add the User to Zoomerang's mailing list if requested during registration.

For Panelists, we ask for some additional demographic information to determine their eligibility to participate in surveys requiring individuals who meet a specific demographic profile.

Zoomerang also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information and the page you request. Cookies are small pieces of information that we store on a User’s computer(s), to recognize returning Users and to monitor traffic through the site. This information helps us to make the site better and more user-friendly. We also collect, with either cookies or web logs, a User’s IP address and login times that are identified by individual user. Finally, we collect the surveys and survey results that you have either deployed or participated in.

NOTE TO PARENTS AND MINORS: We are committed to complying fully with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as amended. We urge minors to check with their parents before entering information on this or any other web site.  
  
Does Zoomerang disclose my Personally Identifiable Information or other information I input into the site to anyone?   
We recognize that, in addition to your Personally Identifiable Information, you may also enter other information into the Zoomerang site. Such other information may include email lists, information about your survey recipients, and other data useful to you. We do not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information or such other information to other Users, Panelists or any other third parties, unless you expressly agree to such disclosure or it is required by law, and except for such information that may be necessary for us to share with our trusted internal and third-party service providers for the operation of our business and the tracking and management of the information we collect from you and other Users and Panelists. 

We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information or other information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on MarketTools or this site; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of MarketTools; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of MarketTools, its web sites or the public. If MarketTools (or our Zoomerang service) should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company or entity, we may sell the information you provide to us on this site to a third party or share your information with any company with whom we merge (and they in turn will be subject to this Privacy Policy).

Please note that if we believe that you have breached the Terms of Use for use of this site, especially with regard to our strict ban on transmitting, publishing or distributing pornographic, obscene, offensive, threatening, harassing, libelous, hate-oriented, harmful, defamatory, racist, illegal or otherwise objectionable materials or content, we will report such conduct to the appropriate authorities and turn over any and all information, including Personally Identifiable Information and other information you have input into the site, to appropriate law enforcement persons or entities.  
  
How does Zoomerang store my Personally Identifiable Information? What are the security measures?  
Zoomerang stores Personally Identifiable Information and other personal information of Users in databases protected by passwords as well as database and network firewalls to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of personal information. We use modern security technology to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we are vigilant in protecting the personal information that you transmit to us, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We will prosecute any unauthorized access to secured information to the fullest extent permitted by law. We periodically review and update security measures to continually provide improved protections for Users.  
Can I edit or delete my Personally Identifiable Information on this site?  
By accessing your account through the Account Information page on our site, you may edit your Personally Identifiable Information. You can also request that we remove your registration information from our current database by clicking on the following [Support Link.](http://zoomerang.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/zoomerang.cfg/php/enduser/std_alp.php)  
Does Zoomerang do anything with survey responses?   
No. We will not use or disclose any survey response information without a User’s permission through an email or other written authorization, unless we are required to do so by law. However, Users may access surveys they have built and their results/data through their individual accounts and lockers protected by a password they have selected.  
International Transfers  
Personally Identifiable Information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which MarketTools or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Our Privacy Policy applies to your Personally Identifiable Information wherever we store or process it.  
Third Party Sites  
Please be aware that some of the Web sites you may choose to link to from our site may collect Personally Identifiable Information and other information about you. The practices of those Web sites concerning the Personally Identifiable Information or other information they collect from you are not covered by this Privacy Policy.  
Changes to this Privacy Policy   
If we change this policy, we will publish changes on this site before those changes will take effect. We will post a notice on our site directing you to the modified policy. Please review this site periodically to keep informed of our most current privacy policy. As always, if you do not agree with our Privacy Policy or any changes to it, you should cease using this site. If you continue to use this site after we have posted a notice that changes have been made to this policy, you will be deemed to have accepted those changes.
