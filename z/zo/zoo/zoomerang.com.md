This Privacy Policy explains the data collection and use practices of [www.zoomerang.com](http://www.zoomerang.com/); it does not apply to other online or offline MarketTools, Inc. sites, products or services. The terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the customer/purchaser utilizing our site [www.zoomerang.com](http://www.zoomerang.com/). The terms "MarketTools," "Zoomerang," "we," "us," and "our" refer to MarketTools, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates. This Privacy Policy is governed by our [Terms of Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20040616023854id_/http%3A//info.zoomerang.com/about/toa.htm). By using this web site, you consent to the data practices prescribed in this statement. We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy that we will include on this page. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy frequently and remain informed about any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often.

**What is Zoomerang?**  
Zoomerang is a survey clearinghouse. Zoomerang is committed to its policy of protecting the privacy and confidential information of our Members, who register to build and deploy surveys and who from time to time might purchase services offered by Zoomerang, and our Panelists, who register to respond to and answer surveys. For Panelists, please also refer to the ZoomPanel Privacy Policy at http://www.zoompanel.com.   
Our site [www.zoomerang.com](http://www.zoomerang.com/) allows our Members to create surveys and questionnaires for distribution to other Members or other third parties who may serve as Panelists for such surveys. Our Terms of Agreement require that, prior to sending a survey, Members must have an ongoing business or personal relationship with a survey recipient, or the Member must have obtained the prior consent of a survey recipient to send emails to a recipient through our site. Questions? Please refer to our [Terms of Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20040616023854id_/http%3A//info.zoomerang.com/about/toa.htm)  
We do not censor the questions or messages in the surveys or the invitations to take surveys that our Members or other third parties may create, nor do we censor the responses you may provide. The sender of a survey is solely responsible for the subject matter and contents of the survey invitation and survey in which you participate, and you are solely responsible for the contents of your response.   
**What Personally Identifiable Information does Zoomerang collect and what does Zoomerang do with it?**  
"Personally Identifiable Information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information, whether at work or at home.  
Upon registration, we ask our Members to provide us with certain Personal Identifiable Information such as their name, country of residence and email address. We use this information to establish individual accounts and lockers, protected by a password that the Member selects. In addition, we use the email address supplied by Members in the registration process to confirm registration, and to send notices and updates to you concerning the services and the site. We will also add you to Zoomerang's mailing list if you requested that during registration.  
We ask for some additional demographic information from our Panelists to determine their eligibility to participate in surveys requiring Panelists who meet a specific demographic profile.   
Zoomerang also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information and the page you request. Cookies are small pieces of information that we store on a user's computers, to recognize returning users and to monitor traffic through the site. This information helps us to make the site better and more user-friendly. We also collect, with either cookies or web logs, a user's IP address and log in times that are identified by individual user. Finally, we collect the surveys and survey results that you have either deployed or participated in. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.  
NOTE TO PARENTS AND MINORS: We are committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as amended. We urge minors to check with their parents before entering information on any web site.  
Does Zoomerang disclose my Personally Identifiable Information to other Members, Panelists or other third parties?   
No, we do not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to other Members, Panelists or any other third parties, unless the individuals involved expressly agree to such disclosure or it is required by law, and except for such information that may be necessary for us to share with our trusted internal and third-party service providers for the operation of our business and the tracking and management of the information we collect from you and other Members and Panelists.  
We may disclose Personal Identifiable Information or other information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on MarketTools or this site; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of MarketTools; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of MarketTools, its web sites or the public. If MarketTools (or our Zoomerang service) should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company or entity, we may sell the information you provide to us on this site to a third party or share your Personally Identifiable Information with any company with whom we merge (and they in turn will be subject to this Privacy Policy).  
Please note that if we believe that you have breached the Terms of Agreement for use of this site, especially with regard to our strict ban on transmitting, publishing or distributing pornographic, obscene, offensive, threatening, harassing, libelous, hate-oriented, harmful, defamatory, racist, illegal or otherwise objectionable materials or content, we will report such conduct to the appropriate authorities and turn over any and all information, including Personally Identifiable Information, to appropriate law enforcement persons or entities. We will comply with any laws or legal process that may require disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information.  
Does Zoomerang collect or disclose information (email addresses, names) that I supply in order to send surveys?  
No, subject to the terms and conditions noted above. When you enter email information for your survey recipients or establish email lists in your personal Address Book, that information remains private in your personal locker. Your password protects that information. As a reminder, if you have breached or breach our Terms of Agreement, Zoomerang will report such conduct to the appropriate authorities and turn over any and all information, including Personally Identifying Information, to appropriate law enforcement persons or entities.  
How does Zoomerang store my Personally Identifiable Information? What are the security measures?  
Zoomerang stores Personal Identifiable Information and other personal information of Members in secure databases protected by passwords as well as database and network firewalls to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of personal information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect the personal information that you transmit to us, we cannot guarantee its absolute security, and you do so at your own risk. While no security systems are infallible, MarketTools (Zoomerang's parent company) will prosecute any unauthorized access to secured information to the fullest extent permitted by law. Zoomerang periodically reviews and updates security measures to continually provide improved protections for the membership.  
Can I edit or delete my Personally Identifiable Information on this site?  
You can notify us at any time to update or remove your registration information from our database by clicking on the following [Support Link](http://zoomerang.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/zoomerang.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=132&p_created=1053648335) and providing us with the updated information, or requesting us to remove your registration. If you do that, we will not keep any of your former Personally Identifiable Information records concerning you unless required to do so by law. However, if you request that Zoomerang remove your registration information from our database, you will be unable to access or use the account you previously created and its associated content without going through the registration process again.   
What does Zoomerang do with survey responses?   
Members may access surveys they have built and their results/data through their individual accounts and lockers protected by a password they have selected. Zoomerang will not use any such information without a Member's written permission through an email or other written authorization. A Member's surveys and their results/data will be stored in the Member's individual account and password-protected locker for no more than 10 days from the launch of the Member's survey. Extended storage is available by subscribing to the zPro Membership.  
International Transfers  
Personal Information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which MarketTools or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.  
Third Party Sites  
Please be aware that some of the Web sites you may choose to link to from our site may collect Personally Identifiable Information and other information about you. The practices of those Web sites linked to this site with respect to their use of your Personally Identifiable Information or other information that they may collect are not covered by this Privacy Policy.  
Changes to this Privacy Policy   
If Zoomerang wishes to change this policy, it will publish changes on this site before those changes will take effect, which is your responsibility to review. As always, if you do not agree with Zoomerang's Privacy Policy, you have the option of requesting that we delete your Personally Identifiable Information from this site.
