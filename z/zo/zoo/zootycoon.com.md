# How Microsoft Helps Protect Your Privacy

November 13, 2002

At Microsoft, we are committed to helping protect your privacy, and to developing technologies that help enhance the safety and security of your computing experience. 

Microsoft offers a wide variety of [products, Web sites, and services](http://www.microsoft.com/catalog/). Many of these have their own privacy statements that describe the specific data collection and use practices of the particular product, site, or service. You will find links to many of our privacy statements at the end of this page. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of those sites, services, and products that you use. 

## A Safe Harbor

As a sign of our commitment to helping protect consumer privacy, Microsoft is a participant in the Safe Harbor Agreement between the United States and the European Union, and meets the Safe Harbor principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce. 

In general, we will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you. For example, personal information is generally requested when you are asked to register before entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site, or when purchasing and registering Microsoft products.

The amount of personal information you are required to supply will normally be limited to that which is necessary to supply the service or carry out the transaction that you have requested. If other information is requested, it will be labeled as optional.

Many Microsoft products, sites, and services provide links to sites and services operated by other companies or organizations. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of those sites and services that you choose to visit, so that you can understand how they may collect, use, and share your personal information. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy statements or practices of sites and services controlled by other companies or organizations.

## Use of Your Personal Information

The personal information we collect from you will be used by Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates to provide the service or carry out the transaction you have requested or authorized. This may include using the personal information for the following purposes: 

  * To provide you with important information about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications.
  * To make a site or service easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the site or service to your particular interests or preferences.
  * To improve the product or service and to provide excellent customer service to users.



The privacy statement of the specific product or service you are using will disclose how the personal information that is collected will be used. 

Except as described below, Microsoft does not transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent. Microsoft may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personal information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. 

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as packaging, sending, and delivering purchases and other mailings; answering customer questions about products or services; processing event registration; or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Microsoft may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft and its family of Web sites, or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, users of Microsoft products or services, or members of the public.

Personal information collected by Microsoft may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. 

## Controlling and Accessing Your Personal Information

Because Microsoft offers a wide variety of different products and services, the personal information collected by each Microsoft product or service may not all reside in a single location. Therefore to access or exercise control over the data submitted at a particular site or via a particular product, you may need to return to that location to learn how to access the data or change your preferences regarding the use of that data.

Nevertheless, Microsoft does believe that you should be able to exercise control over how the personal information you provide will be used. If you provide personal information to Microsoft for one purpose, you will be able to opt-out of that personal information being used for other unrelated purposes.

Please be aware that the choices you make in one context will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to Microsoft in the context of other, separately operated, Microsoft products, sites, or services. 

Microsoft also believes that you should be able to access the personal information you have provided, so that you can update or amend the data where it is inaccurate. Different Microsoft sites and services may have different methods of providing access to the personal information they have stored. Some Microsoft sites and services have even created tools to allow you to directly access and change your personal data in real time. For example, personal information you have provided on the Microsoft.com Web site can be accessed through the [Profile Center](http://register.microsoft.com/regsys/pic.asp). Similarly, the personal information in your MicrosoftÂ® .NET Passport profile can be accessed via the [.NET Passport Member Services](http://memberservices.passport.com/) page.

## Security of Your Personal Information

Microsoft is committed to helping protect the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we help protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

## Use of Cookies or Web Beacons On Microsoft Sites

Many Microsoft Web sites use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you or your computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a Microsoft web page, or register with a Microsoft site or service, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Microsoft Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. While some cookies contain personal information, others allow you to customize a site while remaining anonymous. The privacy statement of the particular site your are visiting will describe how that site uses cookies.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. However, if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the sites or services you visit.

Microsoft Web pages may also contain electronic images known as "Web beacons" -sometimes called single-pixel gifs-that allow Microsoft to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information. They are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about Web site usage. Some Microsoft sites may also contain Web beacons placed there by our advertising partners, to help us determine the effectiveness of our Internet advertising campaigns. 

## Use of .NET Passport

Many Microsoft Web sites and services use .NET Passport to provide sign-in and registration services. When you sign in to a site using .NET Passport, you will be asked to provide your e-mail address and a password to sign you in. This same Passport sign-in allows you to access many other participating Passport Web sites. To learn more about the Passport service and how Passport uses and helps to protect your personal information, please read the [.NET Passport Privacy Statement](http://www.passport.com/Consumer/PrivacyPolicy.asp?lc=1033).
