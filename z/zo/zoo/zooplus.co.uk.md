When you use our website, the Plugins set up a direct connection between your browser and the servers of the social networks, and this allows them to receive information that your IP-address has visited our website. If you click on one of the buttons whilst you are logged-in to one of the social networks, the information that you have visited our website will be logged with your social network account. If you are a member of any of the aforementioned social networks and would prefer that the service providers do not collect data about you via our website and connect it with your membership information, then you must ensure that you log out of the relevant social network before visiting our website. Please note that, as the owners of this website, we do not control what data is collected about you via the plugins, or how it is used by the social media websites concerned. Further information on what data is collected via the plugins, and how this data is used, can be found in the data protection policies of each individual social media organisation.
