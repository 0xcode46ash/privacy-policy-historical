If you choose to provide us with Personal Information about yourself, either through a form on our website or by sending us e-mail, we may collect and use that information to contact you or to send you additional information to process your purchase, provide service and support, and share product, service and company news and offerings with you.  
We may be required to disclose Personal Information in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention, regulation, and other legal action or if we reasonably believe it is necessary to do so to protect our customers, the public, or us.  
If you visit our website simply to browse, we may collect general information about the way in which you use our site, including the time and duration of visit, type of Web browser used, the operating system/platform you are using, your IP address, the websites from which you linked to us, and your CPU speed.
