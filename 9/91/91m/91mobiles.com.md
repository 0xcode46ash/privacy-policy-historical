 [Vijay Sharma](http://www.91mobiles.com/blog/6557/Tata+Docomo+3G+WiFi+Hub+++Rs++5999.html#jsid-1322767260-16) -If you are thinking to buy the product please follow my advice and say TATA to it. I have purchased the device on 30th Oct 2011. Today is 1st Dec and still my Photon Plus SIM has not been activated by company. I have made 50 calls to customer care,nodal officer and appellate authorities but every time they made an excuse that the problem will be fixed in 4-5 hours. They have made no mistake in generation of the bill and sent me a bill of Rs 1150 for the services that very never provided.

Call Center staff has no knowledge about product. Docomo Call center ask you to call Photon Call center and vice-versa.

Even executive promises are fake and nobody listens.

Also Tata Docomo 3G services are very poor and many time there is network congestion and you are unable to connect to internet.

I strongly recommend not to think about buying this product.

 [Rahul Bansal](http://www.91mobiles.com/blog/7779/Tikona+Bill+Free+Wireless+Broadband+Plan+brings+convenience.html#jsid-1322734329-451) -One of the leading broadband offering companies, Tikona has indeed proved its worth as being a reliable partner when it comes to broadband connections. I have had the internet connection for quite some time and I am pretty satisfied.   
I use Tikona wi fi service, and it has exceeded my expectations in the last few months. Quite strangely some of the best names in the industry could not delight me as much as this connection did. Looking forward to up gradation though!   
Superior speed, no security hassles and control on bills. Tikona takes care of every aspect that a customer faces while hiring any broadband connection. They have indeed evolved out to be one of the leading players in the market.   
Lets Congratulate our Team mate â€œMayuri Changle â€ for solving customer â€˜s problem in such a wonderful way with such great follow-up and prompt service that customer is bound to Appreciate her.
