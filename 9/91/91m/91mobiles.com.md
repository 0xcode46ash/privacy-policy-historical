The head office in aubonne should contemplate closing its office in india. the reason being the sheer incompetency of its executives toward resolving issues. they truly are third grades.

 [R Subudhi](http://www.91mobiles.com/reviews/Samsung/Wave+3/the+best+in+its+calss/26343.html#jsid-1338150442-741) -Rahul is missing out on many aspects. Its Bada OS is now outdated. Bada app store is small. Cam is 5 mp, but its output is like 2 mp. You have to remain satisfied with a lot of defaults - for example you can not customize screen brightness or contrast, touch sensitivity, or even date separator. Many camera settings are only defaults and not customisable. I purchased one about a week ago and now I am repenting. If possible, I would exchange it for another set - even Galaxy Ace is better than this one.

Though there are other players in the industry, the actual battle is in between Apple and Samsung. Despite, Apple piercing them in the patent-based battle (Apple won battle in 10 countries across 4 continents), Samsung made the glory in selling the Galaxy devices. So, let's appreciate this super-kid for making enormous profits out of 35 million smartphones sold for the final quarter.

 [Juhi T](http://www.91mobiles.com/blog/12206/HTC+Desire+C+officially+launched.html#jsid-1338015247-484) -There are not great features in this phone, but its 5MP camera and ICS OS are some of the great features that HTC has added to this smartphone. The phone also houses a 1,230 mAh battery under its plastic cover at the rear and you can expect the price tag of this ICS smartphone to be less than â‚¬200 or around $257.
