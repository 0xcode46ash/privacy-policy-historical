Very bad Reliance.  
Moreover, rather than apologizing for their mistake, their customer care will rudely ask you to call them back the next day to waste another 20-30 mins over the phone waiting for them to answer which is again the paid call.

Please don't go for this luring offer as Reliance is simply cheating people.  
Today I recharged my phone with Rs.74.  
After using 1 MB data the GPRS stopped working giving me the message that my account balance is zero.  
Luckily, my account balance was only Rs.10 which was deducted to access 1MB 2G data.  
I then called the customer care. They answered after 20 mins of wait time after 6 attempts just to tell that the info has not been updated in their records & they advised me to call back tomorrow again.  
I never expected such poor & pathetic service from Reliance :(  
I might soon change my operator, thanks to number portability.
