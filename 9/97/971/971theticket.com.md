We may also use your information for hiring, operational and business purposes,or  to find out how we can improve our Site and Station via surveys or online tracking mechanisms, and to develop new services and features that may be of interest to you.  We use aggregate Personal Information to help us to evaluate and modify existing services and features.  We also use your Personal Information to develop new services and features that may be of interest to you. 

We will not sell, exchange, rent, lease or otherwise disclose your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to other third party marketers or any such persons that are not associated with the Station as Advertisers unless it is necessary to: 1) conform to regulatory and legal requirements or to comply with legal process; 2) to protect the safety and security of our users, employees, or property; 3) to defend the rights of the Site or the Station; or 4) to enforce the Terms of Use Agreement.      


We will share your Personal Information with our corporate parents, CBS Radio and CBS Corporation, and aAffiliatesd entities primarily for business and operational purposes.  We will not share your Personal Information with CBS Radio Affiliates -related corporate entitiesfor promotional and marketing purposes.

It is also necessary that we share your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information with our operational service providers, the specialists that provide internal support to Site operations and activities and/or for Site design, development, hosting and operations including maintenance, management, storage and/or fulfillment of our membership and e-mail clubs, the Detroit Best Deals program, various contests, sweepstakes, services, events and online stores.  We use such third parties operational service providto efficiently provide the full range of content, activities and membership services we bring to you and we request that our operational service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to third party marketers that are not associated with the Station or websiteSite.  Additionally, such providers are not to use your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes.

We reserve the right to collect Personal Information using any new technology yet to be developed and to use such technology to provide new services and features to you, as well as for marketing and promotional purposes.  Specific information regarding your choice to Opt-in or to Opt-out to such use, or for sharing your Personal Information with Advertisers, will be provided once the new technology, service, or feature is introduced.

WEBSITE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Generally, you may browse this Site without providing any Personal Information.  For certain activities (such as contest and sweepstakes registrations, or registration for chat rooms and message boards) the Personal Information you voluntarily provide may include your first/middle and last name, email address, birth date, gender, employer or personal preferences, depending on the activity. 

Unless stated otherwise, we do not request contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as “.net” or “.com”) as part of the contact information. Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial email messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative express consent and been informed about other regulatory requirements.  We may inadvertently collect a wireless device number that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest or membership club. However, we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial email.  We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a domain name as such messages are not deemed to be commercial email and therefore, are not regulated by Federal law.   However, when “computer to phone” commercial emails are prohibited by law, we may reject your wireless device contact information when such information is submitted for certain Site features or services.  We will attempt to notify you if we will need new contact information.

For specific purposes (such as contest prize fulfillment or the purchase of goods and services) we may will request a type of confidential personally identifiable information which shall be called “Sensitive Personal Information” and is defined as any individual’s: (1) social security number; (2) driver’s license number or state identification card number; (3) employee identification  number; (4) account number, credit or debit card account number, with or without  any required security code, access code or password that would permit access to an individual’s financial account; (5) mother’s maiden name; (6) passport number; or (7) electronic or digitized signature. Sensitive Personal Information will only be used to implement the specific activity or event it was submitted for.  We will not share your Sensitive Personal Information with Advertisers.

However, more general Personal Information will be used to implement the specific activity or event and will also be used for the marketing of additional events, services and merchandising for this Site and the Station.

DISCLOSURE TO ADVERTISERS

Advertising support allows us to offer, free of charge, many great activities and services to our users such as contests, sweepstakes and special events.  Therefore, we may also use your Personal Information for the marketing of events, products or services of our generous Advertisers.  There are two ways users may receive such information from Advertisers, either indirectly via newsletters, email or direct mail from the Site, or directly from the Advertiser.  We may use one or both methods depending on the activity and the Advertiser.

When we plan to share your Personal Information with Advertisers, you will receive such notice on the Site, in the rules of participation (“Rules of Participation”) for the activity or event, or via an email notice.  However, please be informed that our Advertisers may not have the same privacy policies that we do.  Therefore, you will need to tell us if you do not want to receive marketing information directly from our Advertisers.  You will need to check the “Opt-out” click boxes that may be located on the registration area for the particular event, in an email, or alternatively, notify the Site’s Privacy Administrator at [dan.zampillo@cbsradio.com](mailto:dan.zampillo@cbsradio.com "Linkification: mailto:gherbert@cbs.com").  You will also need to tell us if you do not wish to receive marketing or promotional materials from the Site and/or Station in the same manner.

We also provide you with an option to “Opt-out” of receiving advertising and promotional email from us in compliance with federal law by installing an Opt-out mechanism with all such email messages. You must use the designated method in the email message to notify us of your Opt-out request, as we cannot guarantee that other methods of notification will be effective or timely.  Please be aware that we may continue to contact you via email for administrative or informational purposes, including follow-up messages regarding contests you have entered or other transactions you have undertaken.  By law, such messages are not considered to be commercial email.

We are not responsible for removing your Personal Information from third party lists or entities which you have previously authorized us to share your information.  You will need to contact those entities directly.

COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

The use of cookies is an industry standard and they are currently used on most websites, including this Site.  Cookies are a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a website to the hard drive of a user’s computer so that the website administrator or a third party operational service provider may identify the computer and passively track the user’s activities on the website.  Other technologies such as image tags work in conjunction with cookies and are small image files that may be located on select pages of our Site, or with-in web-based email newsletters that we may send to track your usage and access to features on the Site.  (Image tags are also called web beacons, web bugs, clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs.)  Tracking is important because we can better understand what parts of our website are used the most, when to launch new services and how to enhance current offerings.  We may share the information we receive from cookies and image tags with third parties and our Advertisers in aggregate form, which means that such information does not contain specific Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information about any one visitor.

In short, cookies and image tags collect a user’s Internet protocols, server and/or usage information.  Such data files allow our Site to remember your web browser when you visit our Site and are necessary tools for quick and efficient access to membership clubs, awards programs and contests.  A cookie will not allow the Site to learn any Personal Information (such as your real name and email address) or Sensitive Personal Information that you have not otherwise disclosed.  Cookies and image tags allow the Site to remember important information that will make the Site easier for you to use and helpful in our administration of various activities.  We do not use cookies or image tags to collect other Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information unless you give us permission to do so

This Site may contain advertisements, references and links to other services, web sites and organizations. We may also use third parties to display or serve advertising on the Site and communications to you. Often these third party Advertisers employ cookie and web bug technologies to measure advertising effectiveness. You should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, maintenance, use and disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other web sites you encounter on the Internet.  The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not ours.  Even if we have a relationship with a third party, we do not control their web sites, their technology or their policies and practices regarding your information.  This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information that a third party, an Advertiser or ad server may collect from you.  We encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent or an image tag is used, or you can choose to turn off all such devices.  Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent image tags from tracking your specific activity.   However, if you turn cookies and other technologies off, you may not have access to many features at our Site that make your Internet experience more efficient and enjoyable – like the features mentioned above – and some of our features or Advertiser features or services will not function properly.

MONITORING AND USE OF AGGREGATE PERSONAL INFORMATION

We also reserve the right to monitor and edit any Personal Information about our users, including information about the use of Site activities and services, the contents of users’ email and messages for internal purposes, and when necessary, to disclose to law enforcement personnel, and/or the employer and/or Internet Service Provider of a user that is not in compliance with the Terms of Use Agreement or Privacy Policy.  We will take such measures if we believe it is necessary to protect the security, integrity, and operations of this Site or Station.  Without disclosure of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information about individual users, we may provide aggregate statistics about our users, traffic patterns and related website information to Advertisers, reputable third party vendors or marketing companies.

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY POLICY

Although persons of all ages may visit our Site and participate in activities that do not require the collection of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, we do not knowingly or intentionally collect Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information from children under the age of 13.  Except for the limited circumstances listed below, we will automatically reject and delete the registration or entry of any person we believe in good faith to be underage and does not meet the age eligibility requirements of this Site.  Any false or fraudulent registration or entry from a minor (under the age of 18 or the age of adulthood in your State of residence) will be deemed to be ineligible and will disqualify the minor from the receipt of a prize, benefit, or other participation.

Except to meet Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), or other regulatory and legal purposes, we will not use, store, or disclose any child’s Personal Information to a third party without prior parental consent.  This policy is consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”) which governs the online collection of Personal Information from children under the age of 13.

This Site has a special section designed for children or may have contests and prizes that could appeal to children.  However, we do not knowingly or intentionally collect personal Information from children.  If we unintentionally receive Personal Information from children under the age of 13 in relation to this activity, we will comply with COPPA and reject and destroy such correspondence upon knowledge of such collection, except for the limited circumstances above.  For more information about COPPA, please see the Federal Trade Commission’s website: www.ftc.gov.

EMAIL

We do not generally keep email correspondence, except for those emails that relate to the on-air programs or operations of Station.  As required by the FCC, if any part of your email correspondence relates to Station programming or operations, we must place such correspondence in the Station’s FCC Public Inspection File, or make the correspondence available via electronic file access at the Station to anyone that requests such information.  Therefore, be informed that your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information contained in certain emails, including Personal Information knowingly received from a child under the age of thirteen, will be disclosed to the general public. We request that you not place any Sensitive Personal Information in your email correspondence to the Station that pertains to station programming or operations.  You understand and agree that we are not responsible for Sensitive Personal Information that is improperly disclosed in emails that are made available to the general public in compliance with FCC regulations.

SHOPPING & E-COMMERCE

If this Site sells goods and/or services or provides auction services we will request Sensitive Personal Information that includes your credit card, debit card or other payment information.  The Site may also request additional Personal Information such as full name, billing and shipping address, email address and telephone number and any such information that is required to fulfill your order and to communicate with you regarding your order.  Sensitive Personal Information will be encrypted or collected though a secured Internet connection generally via SSL or S-HTTP protocols.  Such Sensitive Personal Information will also be stored in a commercially reasonable secure manner. We may use your Personal Information, (but not your credit card or debit card number) to contact you about future products, services and discounts from the Station or to provide such information indirectly from our Advertisers, unless you tell us otherwise (“Opt-out”).  We will only use your credit card and debit card number to complete the specific transaction you requested.  Alternatively, the Site may use a third party operational service provider to conduct the financial transaction in a secured manner; the third party payment process will be accessible via a hyperlink from the Site and the operational service provider will be solely responsible for all financial transactions and the collection, use, and storage of your Personal Information.

CHAT ROOMS, MESSAGE BOARDS AND PUBLIC AREAS

For your enjoyment and entertainment, this Site may offer user interactive activities such as blogs, chat rooms, message boards, and/or public forums (“Public Areas”).  If you are required to register to use any interactive area, we do not share any Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information that is entered into the Public Area registration section on the Site with Advertisers.  However, any such information that is posted in Public Areas is available to anyone using the Site.

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to save and archive any content of any nature posted to the Site and that we may, without liability to any user: 1) disclose such content if required to do so by law or to comply with legal processes; 2) to respond to claims that any of the content violates the property, privacy, publicity or other rights of others; or 3) to protect the rights, property or safety of the Site, the Station, its employees, users and members of the public.  For more information on this Site’s rules of conduct for these Public Areas, please see our Terms of Use Agreement.

ADVERTISING AND OTHER THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND HYPERLINKS

This Privacy Policy does not cover third party advertising or third party content that may be present on the Site.  This Site may provide banner and general advertising from third parties, in addition to other content provided by our Advertisers or operational service providers.  Users may from time to time purchase goods or services offered through, or otherwise participate in or send messages concerning such advertising, promotions or third party content offered through the Site.  Such correspondence, transactions and agreements are solely between the user and the Advertiser or the third party content provider and do not involve the Site.  Also, Advertisers and such third party content providers may not have the same privacy policies that we do and you are encouraged to read their privacy policy first. (Also see our section called “Cookies and Other Technologies”)

This Site often provides links to third party websites that could be of interest to our users, including the websites of our Advertisers.  As stated in our Terms of Use Agreement, the Station does not own or control these websites and therefore, is not responsible for the content, business practices, nor operations of such websites.  Third party websites linked on this Site may have different privacy policies and business practices than we do.  The presence of a link to a third party website does not constitute or imply our endorsement, recommendation, or sponsorship of the third party content, goods, or services available through, or contained on, the Site. By use of this Site, you have agreed that you will use the hyperlinks to third party websites at your own risk.

SECURITY MEASURES

We conduct the collection, management, maintenance and storage of website user information in a secure and commercially reasonable manner using acceptable industry standards of security technology and practices (such as electronic security systems and password protections) to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of Personal Information.   We also request that our operational service providers take such precautions.  www.971TheTicket.com databases are accessible only by authorized personnel.

However, please note that when users transmit Personal Information over an unsecured Internet connection, the Site is not responsible for the security of that information during the transmission stage as your email or registration could be copied or intercepted by unknown third parties.  We use a secured connection only for the collection of Sensitive Personal Information, which is necessary for the purchase of goods or services, but we do not use a secured connection for other types of activities.  Therefore, you understand, acknowledge, and agree that you transmit certain Personal Information over this Site at your own risk.

REVIEW, UPDATE, CORRECT, OR DELETE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION

Generally, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected by the Site. You may also correct factual inaccuracies. Certain types of Personal Information that are necessary to check eligibility, such as birth date or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the new information.  Note that we reserve the right to terminate or delete any membership or entry if we believe the Personal Information submitted was knowingly false or fraudulent.

To review, update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected by the Site, please email the Site’s Privacy Administrator at [dan.zampillo@cbsradio.com](mailto:dan.zampillo@cbsradio.com?subject=Privacy%20Inquiry).  To have access to your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, you must provide proof of identification such as full name, street address, city/state and zip code, user ID and password, and/or information about your recent activity on the website.  We reserve the right to deny access to any user if we believe there is a question about your identity.  And if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information.  In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries.

This Privacy Policy was last updated on February 22, 2008 and is effective immediately.
