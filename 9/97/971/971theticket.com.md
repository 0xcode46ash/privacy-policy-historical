WEBSITE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Generally, you may browse this Site without providing any Personal Information.  For certain activities (such as contest and sweepstakes registrations, or registration for chat rooms and message boards) the Personal Information you voluntarily provide may include your first/middle and last name, email address, birth date, gender, employer or personal preferences, depending on the activity. 

Unless stated otherwise, we do not request contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as “.net” or “.com”) as part of the contact information. Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial email messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative express consent and been informed about other regulatory requirements.  We may inadvertently collect a wireless device number that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest or membership club. However, we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial email.  We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a domain name as such messages are not deemed to be commercial email and therefore, are not regulated by Federal law.   However, when “computer to phone” commercial emails are prohibited by law, we may reject your wireless device contact information when such information is submitted for certain Site features or services.  We will attempt to notify you if we will need new contact information.

For specific purposes (such as contest prize fulfillment or the purchase of goods and services) we may will request a type of confidential personally identifiable information which shall be called “Sensitive Personal Information” and is defined as any individual’s: (1) social security number; (2) driver’s license number or state identification card number; (3) employee identification  number; (4) account number, credit or debit card account number, with or without  any required security code, access code or password that would permit access to an individual’s financial account; (5) mother’s maiden name; (6) passport number; or (7) electronic or digitized signature. Sensitive Personal Information will only be used to implement the specific activity or event it was submitted for.  We will not share your Sensitive Personal Information with Advertisers.

However, more general Personal Information will be used to implement the specific activity or event and will also be used for the marketing of additional events, services and merchandising for this Site and the Station.

DISCLOSURE TO ADVERTISERS

Advertising support allows us to offer, free of charge, many great activities and services to our users such as contests, sweepstakes and special events.  Therefore, we may also use your Personal Information for the marketing of events, products or services of our generous Advertisers.  There are two ways users may receive such information from Advertisers, either indirectly via newsletters, email or direct mail from the Site, or directly from the Advertiser.  We may use one or both methods depending on the activity and the Advertiser.

When we plan to share your Personal Information with Advertisers, you will receive such notice on the Site, in the rules of participation (“Rules of Participation”) for the activity or event, or via an email notice.  However, please be informed that our Advertisers may not have the same privacy policies that we do.  Therefore, you will need to tell us if you do not want to receive marketing information directly from our Advertisers.  You will need to check the “Opt-out” click boxes that may be located on the registration area for the particular event, in an email, or alternatively, notify the Site’s Privacy Administrator at [sdagastino@cbsradio.com](mailto:dan.zampillo@cbsradio.com "Linkification: mailto:gherbert@cbs.com").  You will also need to tell us if you do not wish to receive marketing or promotional materials from the Site and/or Station in the same manner.

We also provide you with an option to “Opt-out” of receiving advertising and promotional email from us in compliance with federal law by installing an Opt-out mechanism with all such email messages. You must use the designated method in the email message to notify us of your Opt-out request, as we cannot guarantee that other methods of notification will be effective or timely.  Please be aware that we may continue to contact you via email for administrative or informational purposes, including follow-up messages regarding contests you have entered or other transactions you have undertaken.  By law, such messages are not considered to be commercial email.

We are not responsible for removing your Personal Information from third party lists or entities which you have previously authorized us to share your information.  You will need to contact those entities directly.
