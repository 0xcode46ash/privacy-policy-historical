### What We Collect

We save the details you provide to us in your account profile, including your email address, phone numbers, physical address — you get the idea.

### Spam?

No way! You're a 99designs member! We're not about to start bombarding you with annoying promotional offers (though we may send you the occasional email if you ask us to). And we'll never sell your email addresses or personal details to advertisers, scammers, spammers, or other shifty parties. Creampuff, our boisterous, protective Doberman pinscher, usually takes care of those guys for us anyway.

Oh, don't forget that you can control which emails you receive from us through your Account preferences. Just log in, access the Preferences page, and make your changes.
