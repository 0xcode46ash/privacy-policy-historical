# Privacy Policy | 99designs

### What We Collect

We save the details you provide to us in your account profile, including your email address, phone numbers, physical address — you get the idea. The majority of this information is optional, but whatever you provide we won't disclose it to anyone else unless you agree to have us do so, or we're required to do so by law.

We also collect the following usage statistics at an aggregate level:

  * your IP address
  * your browser version and its capabilities
  * your operating system
  * the date and time of your visit



### What We Do With It

Aside from the obvious uses of your details to enable the functionality of the 99designs site, we use the information we collect to:

  * improve website and system administration
  * conduct research and development
  * complete anonymous traffic analysis, via [Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics)
  * provide statistics to advertisers in the form of aggregated data



This information is kept on secure dedicated servers within the 99designs offices, and with trusted third party hosting providers.

The information collected during the registration process by 99designs may be used by 99designs or referring partners to:

  * contact members
  * customize content to match your preferences
  * display member status
  * display the date of a member´s last visit



The information we collect in this process can also be used to prevent suspended users from re-registering under a different username. We might send cookies to your browser to enable automatic logins when you visit in the future, as well as for content customization. Our Third party vendors, including Google, may also use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to this website.

You have the option to opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising [opt-out page.](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html)

Alternatively you can opt out of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative [opt-out page.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)

If you purchase products, services or credits from 99designs, we'll keep your contact information and a transaction history. We might use your contact details to keep you informed of the status of your business with us, as well as to let you know about 99designs products and services.

Feeling nervous? Don't be! The data we collect about you will only be used by us and our agents. 99designs hereby reserves the right to transfer any data collected in the event of an acquisition, full or partial, of the company or its assets.

If you have any questions about our privacy policies, or you need help to opt out of our email lists, let us know.

### Spam?

No way! You're a 99designs member! We're not about to start bombarding you with annoying promotional offers (though we may send you the occasional email if you ask us to). And we'll never sell your email addresses or personal details to advertisers, scammers, spammers, or other shifty parties. Creampuff, our boisterous, protective Doberman pinscher, usually takes care of those guys for us anyway.

Oh, don't forget that you can control which emails you receive from us through your Account preferences. Just log in, access the Preferences page, and make your changes.

### Contact Us

We invite you to contact us if you have questions about this policy. You may contact us by mail at the following address:
