## Sharing Information

We may employ third party companies to perform functions on our behalf. These functions may include order fulfillment, package delivery, marketing assistance, postal and e-mail delivery, customer service, data analysis, and credit processing. The third parties we contract for these purposes have limited access to your personal information and may not use it for other purposes.

As our business continues to evolve, we may acquire or sell business units or subsidiaries. Customer information is one of the business assets that would be transferred in these types of transactions. In such a situation, your personally identifiable information would only be used in a manner consistent with our pre-existing Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by federal, state and local laws or regulations and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site. In such situations, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to disclose only the personal information required.

## How we protect your personal information

Tristro uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases from our sites, you must use an SSL-enabled browser, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, or Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while itâ€™s transmitted over the Internet.

You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser like Firefox.

Please be aware that payments may be made using a third party company. As such, personal financial information may be collected by this third party company. If such payment methods are used, please take time to review these third party company policies as well, since we are not responsible for the privacy policies of these third party companies.

## Children's Online Privacy

Protecting children on the Internet is very important to us. For that reason, Tristro does not intentionally collect information at our web sites from those we actually know are under 13. Parents can be proactive and limit web site access to their children by installing filtering software.

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) protects children under the age of 13 from the online collection of personal information. Learn more about COPPA at the Federal Trade Commission's web site for children's privacy at <http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.htm>.

If there are material changes to this statement or in how Tristro will use your personal information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how Tristro is protecting your information.
