# Your Privacy Rights | About Us | Minnesota Public Radio

You have come to this page from a Web site produced by Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) or its production and distribution arm, American Public Media (APM). We recognize the importance of privacy to visitors to our Web sites, and we want every user (you) to know how we collect and use information about you when you visit our Web sites. This privacy policy explains what type of information is collected from you when you visit this and other MPR and APM Web sites, and how we may use that information. 

#### Information we automatically gather when you visit MPR and APM Web sites

Like virtually all other Web servers, our Web server automatically creates log files for each visitor who accesses our sites. These "access logs" allow us to make our site more useful to our visitors. The access logs do not record a visitor's name, address, phone number, credit card numbers,or any other personally identifying information. Rather, these log files may contain some or all of the following information:

  * The date of the visit  

  * The time and length of the visit  

  * The path taken through the Web site  

  * The browser being used  

  * A list of files downloaded or viewed  

  * The amount of time spent listening to audio files  

  * The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine accessing our Web site*  

  * Any errors encountered  




_*Most Internet Service Providers use a "dynamic" form of assigning IP Addresses. This means that a visitor may have a different IP address each time he or she visits an MPR Web site. Also, many Internet Service Providers, including America Online, use "proxy servers," which provide even more anonymity for visitors._

We use this information to aid the technical administration of the sites and to better understand how each site is functioning for its users. This information may be correlated with your profile, if you have provided this data, to provide special "personalized" services. This information may also be used in aggregate form.

We may track your visit to sections of our Web sites in order for some site features to function properly for you. In some instances, "cookies" or a similar technology may be used to update your registration records with session information. If you do not wish to accept a cookie from our servers, you can adjust the settings on your browser accordingly. Refusing to accept cookies from the server may result in some limits on the benefits that we can automatically provide as you enjoy the MPR and APM Web sites.

#### Information you give us

We do not collect personally identifying information from our Web sites unless you choose to provide that information to us. Visitors under the age of 13 must obtain permission from their parents or guardians before sending any personally identifying information to MPR and APM.

#### Name and contact information

MPR and APM may ask visitors (you) to provide certain personal information when you: register for a contest; sign up for an e-mail list; request information; purchase products or services; contribute material that may be used on the Web site (e.g., recipes or program reviews); participate in a discussion board or chat; or use a form to become a member of MPR. You will also have the opportunity to request future e-mail contact from us regarding our programs and Web sites. We tell you whether a specific piece of information is required at the time it is requested.

This information may be used by MPR and APM to: verify your identity; manage a contest; gather your editorial comments and feedback; contact you for additional information or administrative purposes; provide attribution for any submitted content of yours published by MPR and APM, and fulfill your order or request. If you opt-in to request future contact from us, you may receive e-mail regarding its programs and Web sites; otherwise, we will contact you only if necessary for the purposes above.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise at the time of submission, the personally identifying information you provide will not be sold, shared, or used for purposes other than listed above. If MPR and APM do wish to add your information to a shared list, it will do so only if you provide permission when you submit your information. By default, your information will not be added; you must "opt-in."

MPR and APM use shared lists to maximize the benefits it can provide through its network of public radio Web sites and through qualified associations. If you allow it, your name and basic contact information may be exchanged for consideration with select companies and organizations, including with other public radio stations and programs. These companies and organizations may attempt to contact you to promote a product or service that they offer. Such contacts from third parties will only be made with our consent, and we will only grant our consent when we consider the offer to be of potential interest and benefit to our Web site users.

MPR and APM will not share, exchange, rent, or sell any of our lists to political parties or candidates for political office.

If you do not want your name and contact information to be used in this way, you may indicate this at the time you provide the information. If you decide after you have provided this information that you do not want us to share your information with any company or organization, you may also notify us by using our [contact form](https://www.publicradio.org/applications/formbuilder/user/form_display.php?form_code=de21a0541403). We cannot remove your name from any third party's list; you will have to contact them directly.

The Direct Marketing Association (DMA) offers a Mail Preference Service that is designed to assist consumers in decreasing the amount of nonprofit or commercial mail they receive at home. For more information about this service, visit the DMA Web site ([www.the-dma.org](http://www.the-dma.org/) and click on the "Consumers" tab. 

#### Demographic and Personal Information

MPR and APM occasionally conduct online surveys, sometimes in association with a contest or other offer. These surveys may ask you for demographic information such as ZIP code, age, education, or income level. Unless otherwise explicitly indicated at the time you provide the information, this information is used in an aggregate form to help us understand our audiences and improve our services. Demographic and profile information may be shared with selected third-party organizations, only on an aggregate basis, to describe the nature of our online audiences.

#### Credit-card information

You must be 18 to engage in money-related transactions on an MPR or APM site. When you do so, you will be asked for a credit card number. All financial transactions take place only on secure servers, and electronic communication of credit-card information is sent only in a secured or encrypted format. Your credit card information is saved, in an encrypted format, on internal systems that are either not connected to the Internet or are protected by advanced firewalls separate from the computers that serve our public sites. This information is not made available to any third party and is considered completely confidential.

#### Special note for MPR contributors

If you use MPR's secure online form to make a contribution to MPR, your name, complete contact information, and all contributions will be passed directly to the MPR Development Department. Your contribution information will be protected in full compliance with the [Contributor List Policy](https://web.archive.org/support/membership/membership_list_policy.shtml).

#### Special Note for Public Insight Network Participants

Public Insight Journalism (PIJ) is a way for people to provide journalists with insights — knowledge and experience — into timely issues. The heart of PIJ is the Public Insight Network, a group of people who have agreed to help us cover the news. APM contacts Public Insight Network participants via survey forms, email and other digital media to ask editorially relevant questions about topics related to our reporting.

Information provided to APM: You may join the Public Insight Network via APM or one of the other organizations that uses PIJ in their newsrooms. When you join, you'll be asked to supply:

  * Your name.
  * Some personal background information that provides context for your insight. For example, you may be asked to provide your age and educational background. 
  * Your insight on a topic that is relevant to our reporting.



How APM stores your data: The data you supply is stored in a separate, secure database at APM. It may be accessed by a small circle of journalists as part of their reporting. It is never combined with information that you provide as a part of other relationships that you may have with APM. For example, it is not combined with the information you provide to APM for membership purposes.

How APM may use your data: APM will not use your name, personal information, or the insights you share for any purpose other than the Public Insight Network. If you agree to let us broadcast, publish or make public a specific insight, then your permission will apply only to that insight. Permission for use of a specific insight is not deemed permission for the public use of any other prior or future insight. Your name and/or personal information will never be traded, sold, or rented to other organizations. You will never be solicited or receive marketing materials from APM, Minnesota Public Radio or from any other organization as a result of your participation in the Public Insight Network. Your participation in the Insight Network, and the information and insights you share therein, will have no influence or effect on any other interaction you may have with APM or MPR, and vice versa.

How other PIJ newsrooms may use your data: APM has relationships with other organizations that use PIJ in their newsrooms. You may sign up for the Insight Network via one of those other organizations, and may "opt in" to provide insights to multiple organizations. If you choose to share insights with more than one PIJ newsroom, your prior insights will be visible to journalists in both organizations for background purposes.

How to learn more about PIJ and the Insight Network: For additional information about PIJ and the Public Insight Network, please see <http://americanpublicmedia.publicradio.org/publicinsightjournalism/faq.shtml>.

All other portions of "Your Privacy Rights" remain in full force and effect. If a discrepancy arises between the provisions of this Special Note and those found elsewhere on this page, then the provisions of this Special Note will apply.
