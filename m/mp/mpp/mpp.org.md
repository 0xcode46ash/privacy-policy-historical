# MPP's Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy is important to the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP). We are committed to keeping your personal information confidential.

### Why we collect personal information

MPP collects and uses personal information to provide individuals with news and information regarding MPP. In addition, we use personal information (e.g. e-mail address, city, and state) to keep e-mail subscribers up-to-date on the latest marijuana policy news and information we think they'd like to hear about.

### When we disclose contact information

MPP does not share any of your personal information at any time with any organization. Given that MPP is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States, we may contact you on behalf of another organization doing work related to ours. These updates will be sent by MPP personnel via MPP's secure system. Your personal information will only be handled by MPP employees who are knowledgeable of all rules and policies regarding securely handling all information. They will protect your personal information in accordance with MPP's Privacy Policy.

MPP occasionally allows other organizations to send mail to individuals on its lists. In these cases, lists containing only names and addresses (no contribution data or other personal information) are delivered to a third-party mailing house for one-time use for that organization's mailing. To request that we never allow your contact information to be used even in this secure manner, please contact [membership@mpp.org](mailto:membership@mpp.org). If possible, please include full name, postal address, phone number, and the e-mail address at which you receive messages from MPP.

MPP is dedicated to providing a safe and secure environment for your personal information.

### How we protect your personal information

MPP safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet.

MPP uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all Web pages where donations are submitted. To make donations to MPP or organizations supported by MPP, you must use an SSL-enabled browser. (Any current version of Firefox, Internet Explorer or Safari will work.) This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.

### Access to your personal information

If you would like your personal information updated or modified, you can contact [membership@mpp.org](mailto:membership@mpp.org) with your request. If possible, please include full name, postal address, phone number, and the e-mail address at which you receive messages from MPP.

### Collecting other personal information

When you browse MPP's Web site, you are able to do so anonymously. We do not collect personal information when you browse â€” not even your e-mail address. We do monitor site traffic and viewing habits.

Like many Web sites, MPP's Web site uses "cookie" technology. This information is used to determine the last time you visited our site and which of MPP's state sites you last visited in an effort to personalize your site visit.

### Our organizational commitment to privacy

MPP does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information.

MPP's Web site contains limited links to other sites. MPP does not share your personal information with those sites, nor is MPP responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those organizations.

If we are going to use your personal information differently from what is stated here, we will try to contact you via e-mail using the most recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new manner.
