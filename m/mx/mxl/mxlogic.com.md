We also use cookies (small text files transferred from our Web site to your hard drive) to recognize repeat users and facilitate your access to our site. Cookies do not damage files or allow anyone to access your personally identifiable information - they simply allow us to tailor information and provide automation for session management.

>  The security of the information you provide to MX Logic is important to us. We use encryption and other security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of sensitive information under our control. However, MX Logic's site includes links to other sites, and when you choose to visit those sites, we are not responsible for their privacy policies or how they treat user information.

> Passwords are never released to any party other than authorized client personnel except as required for law enforcement purposes. Customer or user configurations and email messages are processed automatically by software, so humans do not review this information. Customer or user configuration information provided to MX Logic is used explicitly to deliver services that match your requirements and not for any other purpose. All user-specific information and email message information, including content, addresses, categorizations, and IP addresses-is kept strictly confidential. MX Logic delivers only services that comply with the existing service agreement.

>  If MX Logic is going to use customer identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
