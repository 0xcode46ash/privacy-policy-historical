# Privacy Policy | Minnesota Historical Society

The Minnesota Historical Society (MNHS) collects certain information from users, and this page explains the types of information we gather and what we do with it. We do not sell any personal information to third parties.

## Server log data

Our system collects server log data, which may include an IP address, the type of browser and operating system used, the time of day visited, the pages viewed and search requests. We aggregate this data and use it for statistical purposes, helping us to improve the navigation and content of our website.

## Email lists

If you sign up for one of our email lists, we'll only send you the kinds of information you've requested. We won't share your information with anyone outside of MNHS. You can unsubscribe at any time.

## Web forms or e-mail

Personally identifying information that you provide by e-mail or web forms will be used only for those purposes that are described at the point of collection, such as to send information to you or to respond to your questions or comments.

## Surveys

From time to time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in surveys is completely voluntary, and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address) and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

## Cookies

A form of anonymous website user information that we are collecting is called a "cookie." A cookie is a small text file of information that our web server stores on your Internet-connected device to distinguish your visit to our site from the hundreds or thousands who may be visiting our site at the same time. This cookie is anonymous and is only active while you are visiting our site and is not used for marketing purposes or for any reason that may compromise your privacy.

If you choose not to accept cookies, certain sections of our websites may not work as intended.

## Links to Other Sites

Our website has links to many other websites. When you go to another site, you are subject to the privacy and security policies of that site. MNHS cannot attest to the accuracy of information provided there.

## Children and Privacy

MNHS collects limited information about children for demographic purposes.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

MNHS reserves the right to change the policy on use of information collected. Any changes in policy will be noted in a revised privacy policy statement and will be posted at least 30 days prior to implementation. You may direct any privacy policy questions to [webmaster@mnhs.org](mailto:webmaster@mnhs.org).
