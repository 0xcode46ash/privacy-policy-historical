# Citynet - Citynet's Privacy Policy - Voice, Data, Internet Provider.

## Privacy Policy

It is unfortunate, but there is a certain element of our society that seeks to exploit private information to their financial or other gain.  We at Citynet want you to know that we are highly concerned about protecting our Customers’ private information.  Accordingly, Citynet has adopted several privacy related policies aimed at ensuring the confidentiality of any private information which comes into the possession of the Company and its employees.

It is inevitable that during the business relationship between Citynet and its Customers certain private information will necessarily be collected by Citynet.  However, Customers should understand that, to the extent Citynet collects private information, that information will only be used for legitimate business purposes.

As part of the Citynet-Customer relationship, Citynet may collect private information such as a Customer’s full legal name, company name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, social security number, email address, banking information and credit card information.  Collection of this information allows us to efficiently communicate with you and manage your services and your account. 

Similarly, Citynet also utilizes cookies in order facilitate more effective use of our website by our Customers.  Citynet only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to determine how often customers use parts of our website or services so that we can make the website appealing to as many Customers as possible and improve our services.

While Citynet may on occasion share personal information with our business partners for business purposes or as otherwise required by law, any personal information collected by Citynet will not be shared, sold or otherwise provided to any third party for its independent use and/or benefit without first obtaining your written permission to do so.

Citynet also maintains a Customer Proprietary Network Information policy that can be viewed at the following link:  <http://www.citynet.net/content/file/2011_Citynet_CPNI_Policy.pdf>.  This policy is maintained by Citynet for the purpose of protecting our Customers’ private telecommunications information, including, without limitation, technical configuration and usages of telecommunications service and information contained on invoices for telecommunications services.

Citynet also maintains an internal policy for fraud protection.  This policy is designed to assist in protecting our Customers from identity theft.  In conjunction with this policy, Citynet requires that its Customers establish a secret answer to a question selected by each Customer in order to ensure our Customers are clearly identified when interacting with Citynet personnel.

Citynet may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used/collected.
