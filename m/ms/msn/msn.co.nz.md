MSN New Zealand Limited ("MSN NZ") is wholly owned subsidiary of Ninemsn Pty Limited, Australia's leading online network. MSN NZ delivers content drawn from a wide variety of sources including ACP magazines as well as providing access to leading global Microsoft applications such as Hotmail, MSN Messenger and Live Search. Any information that you provide under Microsoft services provided through our site may be collected and used both by Microsoft, governed by the [Microsoft Online Privacy Statement](http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-nz/default.aspx), and by MSN NZ, governed by this privacy policy.

These policies are in addition to MSN NZ's general [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/article.aspx?id=227596) governing the Network and should be read in conjunction with such Terms of Use.

**Your personal information is important to us**

We recognise that your privacy is very important and that you have a right to control personal information. We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. The following sections set out how we handle and protect your personal information and safeguard your privacy. 

**How we collect information about you**

Whenever you visit the Network, our servers automatically record information about your usage of the Network, such as the time of the visit, its duration and the pages you visit. This is to help us understand what parts of our Network our users enjoy the most and to help us ensure that advertisements on the Network are most directly relevant to your interests. The information we collect about you is anonymous. 

**Our use of cookies**

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. However, if you do not wish to receive any cookies, you may set your browser to refuse them. In some instances this may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of parts of the Network.   
Cookies provide us with aggregated information on how users interact on our Network, track which advertisements are effective and help us improve your Network experience. Cookies do not personally identify you, but your browser.   
MSN NZ uses AdExpert to manage advertising on the Network and provide aggregate information on the use of our Network. AdExpert uses cookies to build anonymous profiles which we can use to tailor content, promotions and advertising and perform anonymous market research. We do not allow AdExpert to collect any personally-identifiable information, nor is the information ever merged with personal information such as your name, address or email address or any information that is considered sensitive or would compromise your privacy. 

  * Required by law or to enforce our rights;
  * We believe it necessary in order to provide you with a service which you have requested;
  * We suspect that your use of the Network is in breach of the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/article.aspx?id=227596)
  * To protect the rights or property of MSN NZ, any MSN NZ user or any member of the public; or
  * To lessen a serious threat to a person's health or safety.



We will never share your personal information with a third party or allow a third party to promote its products and services directly to you without your explicit consent.   
In order to operate the Network or deliver a service you have explicitly requested, we sometimes share your personal information with an affiliate or with a service partner (such as Microsoft, which operates Passport Network Hotmail and MSN Messenger applications). 

**Communicating with MSN NZ members: service messages and promotional messages we send to you**

From time to time we may send you service emails which contain important information about updates, changes and developments on the Network, such as if we take down a service which we know you are currently using, or, if we have improved a service and want to communicate its new functionality to you. For you to continue to make the most of whatâ€™s available on the Network, it is essential that we send these communications.   
From time to time, we may send you offers from our carefully selected partners, email newsletters to which you have subscribed, and tell you about new competitions.   
You can manage the type of information you receive from us by: 

  * unsubscribing from the message you receive; or
  * emailing us at [nzadmin@ninemsn.com.au](mailto:nzadmin@ninemsn.com.au) please allow seven days for this request to be processed. 



**How we store your information and keep it secure**

We will take all reasonable steps to keep secure any information we hold about you and to keep this information accurate and up to date. Your information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities.   
In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us. However, we will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to your personal information.   
You can also play an important role in keeping your personal information secure by maintaining the confidentiality of any password and accounts used on the MSN NZ Network. Please notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security. 

**What happens on Co-branded Sites and MSN NZ links to other websites**

We provide links to websites outside the Network. These linked sites are not under the control of MSN NZ and we do not accept responsibility for the conduct of companies linked to our Network. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website, we advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of that website. 

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**

We will continuously review our Privacy Policy to ensure that it protects your privacy while supporting your user experience on the Network. We encourage you to keep visiting our Privacy Policy to see if any updates have been made.
