Mpls.St.Paul Online collects no personal information about its visitors except in cases in which we expressly ask for it and visitors supply it willingly. We will not sell or transfer the information we collect to a third party unless we expressly state our intention to do so at the time and place at which we collect the information. 

Subscribers to our "Weekend Recommender" email list agree to receive messages from the site's editor no more than once weekly.

Users should be aware that when they voluntarily provide personal information (such as email addresses, names, and so on) in the bulletin and chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.
