**What Information We Collect and How We Use That Information:**   
Our registration forms require users to give us contact information that may include name, email address, format preference (HTML vs. Text), address, interests, and similar information. We do not request or store sensitive information from our visitors, such as credit card or social security numbers. 

**Internet Protocol Address:**   
We collect an IP address from all visitors to our Site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, analyze trends, track users' movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the site, and deliver customized, personalized content. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Use of "Cookies":**   
Our Site may use cookies to enhance your experience while using our Site. Cookies are pieces of information that some Web sites transfer to the computer that is browsing that Web site and are used for record-keeping purposes at many Web sites. Use of cookies makes Web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords, your personal preferences regarding your use of the particular Web site and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly.

Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies.

**Security:  
** All information provided to MSPCA-Angell is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our Site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of MSPCA-Angell. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. Donations processed on this website are [VeriSign Secured](https://seal.verisign.com/splash?form_file=fdf/splash.fdf&dn=SECURE2.CONVIO.NET&lang=en).

**Tell-A-Friend:**   
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our Site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. MSPCA-Angell will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site. MSPCA-Angell stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. 

**Other Web Sites:**   
Our Site contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another Web site for which MSPCA-Angell has no responsibility. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on all such sites as their policies may be different than ours.
