                                      Privacy Policy
Overview
MSDSonline Inc. (“MSDSonline”) is serious about protecting your privacy and recognizes
that you care how information about you is used and shared. We appreciate your trust
that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice (this “Privacy Policy”) describes how
we may collect personal information about you, how we may use it, with whom we may
share it, what choices you have regarding it, and how we protect it. This Privacy Policy is
incorporated into and is a part of the Terms of Use of this MSDSonline Website
(www.MSDSonline.com, this “Site”) and we encourage you to become familiar with the
terms and conditions contained herein. By accessing and using this Site, you agree that
you have read and understand this Privacy Policy, and that you accept and consent to
the privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy.
Changes to Privacy Policy
From time to time, MSDSonline may change its privacy practices because of changes in
relevant and applicable legal or regulatory requirements, the business or business
practices of MSDSonline, or in its attempts to better serve your needs. Notice of such
changes to our privacy practices will be given in the manner described in MSDSonline’s
Terms of Use for this Site and a revised Privacy Policy will be posted at this location.
What Information Do We Collect?
MSDSonline may collect various types of information from or about you. During the Site
registration process and the MSDSonline subscriber registration process, you supply us
with basic contact information (such as name, address, telephone number, e‐mail
address and company name), as well as billing information. This information is generally
entered into fields in the registration and subscription forms and enables you to take full
advantage of the products and services that we offer. Should you purchase any
MSDSonline subscription or services on or through the Site, the information that you
supplied during the registration process may be used to track details about those
purchases.
MSDSonline may also retain the content of and metadata regarding any correspondence
you may have with MSDSonline or its customer service representatives, regardless of
the mode of communication by which such correspondence was made. This information
helps MSDSonline to improve the Site and the materials, products and services that we
offer on the Site, and to more effectively and efficiently respond to both current and
future inquiries.
As with many other Web sites, the Web servers used to operate the MSDSonline Site
collect certain data pertaining to you and the equipment and communications method
that you use to access the Internet and the Site. Without combining these data with
other sources of information, they do not readily identify you. They do reveal such
things as the Internet protocol (“IP”) address assigned to your computer, pages you
accessed on the Site, or immediately prior to visiting the Site, and the length of time you
spent at the Site. This information is collected to, among other things; facilitate Site
operation and system administration, to generate aggregate, non‐identifiable statistical

information, and to improve content and content delivery with regard to the Site and
the materials, products and services that MSDSonline makes available on the Site.
MSDSonline uses “cookies” (small text files stored on your computer) to help track and
customize your access and use of the Site. Cookies store and retain information that
helps us recognize you when you return to the Site following a previous visit. Cookies
may also store any login or ID assigned to you by MSDSonline and the associated
password, though this information is stored in encrypted form. Most popular Internet
browser packages allow you to configure the browser so as not to accept cookies.
However, setting your browser to reject cookies may prevent you from taking full
advantage of the Site and the materials, products and services that MSDSonline makes
available on the Site.
How Do We Use The Information That We Collect?
In addition to the uses mentioned or described above, MSDSonline uses the information
that it collects from or about you to improve the materials, products and services that
MSDSonline makes available on the Site, to notify you of changes made to the Site or
new products made available on or through the Site, to evaluate your needs and
customize Site content delivered to you according to those needs, to facilitate the
processing of any purchases you make through the Site, to send you promotional
material from MSDSonline and some of our affiliates, and for other legitimate and
lawful business purposes of MSDSonline. MSDSonline does not share information
collected about you with third parties, except with regard to certain special programs
that we offer in connection with some of our business associates, which may involve
special promotions and/or pricing, and in which you are participating. Should you
register as a participant in one of those programs, MSDSonline will acknowledge your
registration and notify our applicable business associate of your registration, thereby
enabling you to receive the corresponding program benefits. It is our policy not to sell
lists containing personal information about Site users, registrants or subscribers.
MSDSonline may provide aggregate statistics about our clients, sales, traffic patterns,
and related site information to reputable third‐party vendors, but these statistics will
include no personally identifying information. MSDSonline may release account
information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to
(i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or (iii)
protect the rights of MSDSonline or another party.
What Choices Do You Have?
You may update at any time the information about you and your personal preferences
that is stored from your Site or subscriber registration. You may also ask us at any time
to correct any inaccuracies contained in your information or to remove your name from
our list of Site users who wish to receive electronic communications and e‐mail
advertisements from MSDSonline and our affiliates by simply sending such a request to
us at the numbers or addresses given below. Once you opt‐out, we will honor your
choice until you inform us otherwise. Please remember, however, that if we have
already shared information about you pursuant to your registration and participation in
any special programs of our business associates (as described above), we have no
control over how such business associates may further use that information and you will
need to contact them directly in that regard.

How Do We Protect Information Collected About You?
MSDSonline places a high value on protecting information transmitted via this Site. For
this reason, we use state‐of‐the‐art security solutions, including VeriSign’s Site Trust 128
bit SSL encryption technology to process payments and to provide secure
communication methods. In addition, the Site is protected by a firewall that provides a
high level of security. MSDSonline takes commercially reasonable measures to secure
and protect customer‐specific information transmitted via or stored on our Site.
However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee that information
users supply will be totally secure.
Business Transfers
As MSDSonline continues to grow and develop its business, it is possible that its
corporate structure might change or that it might merge or otherwise combine with, or
that substantially all of its assets might be acquired by, another company. In any such
transactions, customer information generally is, will most probably be, and should be
expected to be one of the transferred business assets.
Linked Sites
For your convenience, some hyperlinks may be posted on the Site that link to other Web
sites not under the control of MSDSonline. We are not responsible for and this Privacy
Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of those sites. We encourage you to seek
out and read the privacy policy of any Web site that you visit. In addition, when you
initiate a transaction on a Web site that our Site links to, even if you reached that site
through our Site, the information that you submit to complete that transaction becomes
subject to the privacy practices of the owner of that linked site. You should read their
privacy policies to understand how they use and protect personal information that they
collect. MSDSonline is not responsible for the privacy or information practices of its
suppliers or any third party Web sites.
