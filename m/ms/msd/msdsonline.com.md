Privacy Policy
Overview
MSDSonline is serious about protecting your privacy and recognizes that you care how information about
you is used and shared. We appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice
(this “Privacy Policy”) describes how we may collect personal information about you, how we may use it,
with whom we may share it, what choices you have regarding it, and how we protect it. This Privacy
Policy is incorporated into and is a part of the Terms of Use of the MSDSonline Web site
(www.msdsonline.com, the “Site”) and we encourage you to become familiar with our privacy practices,
as stated below. By accessing and using the Site, you agree that you have read and understand
this Privacy Policy, and that you accept and consent to the privacy practices described in this
Privacy Policy.
Changes to Privacy Policy
From time to time, MSDSonline may change its privacy practices because of changes in relevant and
applicable legal or regulatory requirements, the business or business practices of MSDSonline, or in its
attempts to better serve your needs. Notice of changes to our privacy practices will be given in the
manner described in MSDSonline’s Terms of Use for the Site, and a revised Privacy Policy will be posted
on the Site.
What Information Do We Collect?
MSDSonline may collect various types of information from or about you. During the Site registration
process and the MSDSadvantage subscriber registration process, you supply us with basic contact
information (such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and company name), as well as
billing information. This information is generally entered into fields in the registration and subscription
forms and enables you to take full advantage of the products and services that we offer. Should you
purchase any MSDSonline products or services on or through the Site, the information that you supplied
during the registration process may be used to track details about those purchases.
MSDSonline may also retain the content of and metadata regarding any correspondence you may have
with MSDSonline or its customer service representatives, regardless of the mode of communication by
which such correspondence was made. This information helps MSDSonline to improve the Site and the
materials, products and services that we offer on the Site, and to more effectively and efficiently respond
to both current and future inquiries.
As with many other Web sites, the Web servers used to operate the MSDSonline Site collect certain data
pertaining to you and the equipment and communications method that you use to access the Internet and
the Site. Without combining these data with other sources of information, they do not readily identify
you. They do reveal such things as the Internet protocol (“IP”) address assigned to your computer, the
pages you access on the Site, the universal resource locator (“URL”) of the Web page you viewed
immediately prior to visiting the Site, and the length of time you spend at the Site. This information is
collected to, among other things; facilitate Site operation and system administration, to generate
aggregate, non-identifiable statistical information, and to improve content and content delivery with
regard to the Site and the materials, products and services that MSDSonline makes available on the Site.
MSDSonline uses “cookies” (small text files stored on your computer) to help track and customize your
access and use of the Site. Cookies store and retain information that helps us recognize you when you
return to the Site following a previous visit. Cookies may also store any login or ID assigned to you by
MSDSonline and the associated password, though this information is stored in encrypted form. Most
popular Internet browser packages allow you to configure the browser so as not to accept cookies.
However, setting your browser to reject cookies may prevent you from taking full advantage of the Site
and the materials, products and services that MSDSonline makes available on the Site.
                                                                                                          1


How Do We Use The Information That We Collect?
In addition to the uses mentioned or described above, MSDSonline uses the information that it collects
from or about you to improve the materials, products and services that MSDSonline makes available on
the Site, to notify you of changes made to the Site or new products made available on or through the Site,
to evaluate your needs and customize Site content delivered to you according to those needs, to facilitate
the processing of any purchases you make through the Site, to send you promotional material from
MSDSonline and some of our affiliates, and for other legitimate and lawful business purposes of
MSDSonline. MSDSonline does not share information collected about you with third parties, except with
regard to certain special programs that we offer in connection with some of our business associates, which
may involve special promotions and/or pricing, and in which you are participating. Should you register as
a participant in one of those programs, MSDSonline will acknowledge your registration and notify our
applicable business associate of your registration, thereby enabling you to receive the corresponding
program benefits. It is our policy not to sell lists containing personal information about Site users,
registrants or subscribers.
What Choices Do You Have?
You may update at any time the Site or subscriber registration information about you and your personal
preferences that we store on the Site. You may also ask us at any time to remove your name from our
list of Site users who wish to receive electronic communications and e-mail advertisements from
MSDSonline and our affiliates by simply sending such a request to us at the numbers or addresses given
below. Once you opt-out, we will honor your choice until you inform us otherwise. Please remember,
however, that if we have already shared information about you pursuant to your registration or
participation in any special programs of our business associates (as described above), we have no control
over how such business associates may further use that information and you will need to contact them
directly in that regard.

How Do We Protect Information Collected About You?
MSDSonline places a high value on protecting information transmitted via the Site. For this reason, we use
state-of-the-art security solutions, including VeriSign’s Site Trust 128 bit SSL encryption technology to
process payments and to provide secure communication methods. In addition, the Site is protected by a
firewall that provides a high level of security. MSDSonline takes commercially reasonable measures to
secure and protect customer-specific information transmitted via or stored on our Site. However, no
security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee that information users supply will be totally
secure.
Business Transfers
As MSDSonline continues to grow and develop its business, it is possible that its corporate structure might
change or that MSDSonline might merge or otherwise combine with, or that substantially all of its assets
might be acquired by, another company. In any such transactions, customer information generally is,
most probably will be, and should be expected to be one of the transferred business assets.

the control of MSDSonline. We are not responsible for, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to, the
                                                                                                          2


privacy practices of those sites. We encourage you to seek out and read the privacy policy of any Web
site that you visit. In addition, when you initiate a transaction on a Web site that our Site links to, even if
you reached that site through our Site, the information that you submit to complete that transaction
becomes subject to the privacy practices of the owner of that linked site. You should read their privacy
policies to understand how they use and protect personal information that they collect. MSDSonline is not
responsible for the privacy or information practices of its suppliers or any third party Web sites.
