Thank you for visiting this website (the "Website"). Your patronage means a lot to us. At Madison Square Garden, L.P. ("MSG"), we understand that privacy is an important issue for visitors to our websites and are committed to safeguarding your privacy. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes the information we collect, what we do with it and the safeguards we have in place to protect it.

Before you submit any information to the Website, please read this Policy for an explanation of how we will treat your personal information. By using any part of the Website and submitting your personal data, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as further outlined below in this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not provide personal identifiable data to us. Your use of any part of the Website indicates your acceptance of this Policy and of the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy. Please note that this Policy applies only to personal information collected on the Website. It does not apply to any other information collected or obtained by any other means by members of the "MSG Family". For purposes of this Policy, the term "MSG Family" includes, as modified and without limitation, MSG Media, New York Rangers, New York Knicks, New York Liberty, Madison Square Garden Entertainment, Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, The Chicago Theatre, the Wang Theatre and each of their respective parent companies and affiliated entities (i.e. entities that are controlled by, controlling or under common control with such entities.)

As we update and expand our services, we reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted here so that you are always aware of what information is collected, how it is used and when, if ever, it is disclosed. Your continued use of the Website will signify acceptance of the terms of the new policy.

**HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION**

When you register for an account or visit certain portions of the Website, you may be prompted to provide, on a voluntary basis, certain information about yourself such as: (i) name; (ii) email address; (iii) age; (iv) mailing address; (v) hobbies; (vi) sports and entertainment interests; (vii) telephone number; (viii) fax number; and (ix) viewpoints on current events. You are not required to provide any information to use our Website, although certain areas do require you to have an account and will not be accessible without registration.

Locations on our Website at which information may be collected include, without limitation, the "MSG Insider Program," "Email Us," "Liberty E-News," "NYK Mail," "Blue Shirt Extra," "Madison Square Garden Entertainment Backstage Access," "Request for information," "Request an Appointment" forms, as well as voluntary online surveys, promotional offerings and sweepstakes.

We may also track your interactions with us, such as your site activity, through use of cookies and other technology. We do this to provide you with better service, to improve your customer experience, and for internal research and reporting purposes.

In addition to information that identifies you, the MSG Family routinely gathers anonymous data on Website activity, such as how many people visit the site, what pages they visit, where they come from, how long they stay, what items they purchase, etc. Such data is collected on an aggregate, anonymous basis, through the use of Internet server logs and cookies. We may use anonymous or aggregated data for any purpose, including for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with third parties such as advertisers.

**HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**

By providing information on the Website, you agree that personal information that you provide may be used by the MSG Family and Partners (as defined herein) for purposes of offering discounts, promoting services and products, providing new services and products, providing news on upcoming sporting and entertainment events, providing programming schedules, conducting surveys, providing special gift offerings, offering ticket discounts, conducting games and sweepstakes, and other similar purposes.

Individuals who may have authorized access to your information include our employees, agents, and affiliates within the MSG Family and Partners, though we seek to limit access to individuals who need it to do their job. Sometimes, we may provide access to information to select third parties to assist us in providing services or for other legitimate business purposes. For example, we may provide access to certain information to companies providing services to us, including billing, sales and marketing, market research, fulfillment, data storage, analysis and processing, and legal services. We may also provide access to third parties who assist us in providing targeted advertising. The frequency of such access depends on our business needs, and third parties who have such access may not use the information for any other purpose, including their own marketing.

**WHEN WE DISCLOSE USER INFORMATION**

We will not disclose personally identifiable information to non-affiliated third parties unless (a) it is necessary for us to render our services or conduct a legitimate business activity related to our services; (b) you provide an appropriate consent in advance.

You acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve and disclose your account information and content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of MSG, its agents and affiliates, its users and the public. We may also disclose information to law enforcement agencies in emergency circumstances, where the disclosure of such information is consistent with the types of emergency disclosures permitted or required by law.

Finally, we also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all of your information, including your personally identifiable information, to a successor company in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all, or components, of our business.

**CONSENT TO TRANSFER**

This site is operated in the United States. If you are a resident of the European Union or other location outside the United States, please be advised that any information you provide will be transferred to the United States. By using this website, you consent to this transfer and to the use of the personal identifiable data as described herein.

**UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION**

To keep information that you provide via this website accurate, current and complete, visit your Website subscription page(s) or email msgfeedback@thegarden.com to update and/or correct any information previously provided. If a member name and password were required to access the feature, you will need to provide such information to update your registration information. If you have forgotten your password, you may obtain it by visiting the registration area and requesting that a hint be sent to you at the email address you originally provided during registration.

**LINKS**

You should note that the Website has business relationships with (and may provide hyperlinks to) unaffiliated third parties that are not part of the MSG Family (e.g. sites that offer discounts for certain products, sells tickets, sells MSG merchandise, or advertises ticket promotions or provides fantasy games, subscription services, registration for camps and clinics, etc.) ("Partners") and may share this information with such business partners in order that they may offer you special promotions. If you visit a third party site by clicking on such hyperlink found on our webpage, you will be subject to that third party site's privacy policy; and we encourage you to review that website's privacy policy before providing any personally identifiable information. The entities controlling these third party websites are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and rules.

**COOKIES**

Data is gathered through the use of Internet server logs and cookies. A web server log is a file where website activity is stored. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website sends to a visitor's computer, which is stored on his or her hard drive. MSG uses cookies to track repeat visits to its website. Although MSG assigns a cookie to a visitor's computer, it does not know who that visitor is unless that person specifically tells us. Please know that you have the ability to disable cookies from being used to track visits to the Website.

**SECURITY**

MSG may offer e-commerce transactions via the Website to you. To protect your personal identifiable information, MSG uses three layers of security:  
(1) Users are required to login using a unique user ID and password.  
(2) A firewall (a combination of computer hardware and software) keeps unauthorized users from accessing information within MSG's computer network.  
(3) Encryption technology is used to secure customer data when it's being transferred from one computer to another.

**VENUE AND JURISDICTION**

If any disputes arise between us regarding your use of the Website, such disputes shall be resolved according to the laws of the State of New York, and the federal and state courts of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all claims.

**YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

Beginning January 1, 2005, California Law permits visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to msgfeedback@thegarden.com or write to us at MSG.COM, Madison Square Garden, L.P., Four Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, New York 10121.

**INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN**

MSG does not knowingly collect or use personal information from children voluntarily supplied without verifiable parental consent of a child (e.g. by requiring parents to fax a signed consent form, or sending emails that can only be opened with a PIN number supplied upon extending parental consent). A parent may revoke previously extended approval at any time. By giving parental and/or legal guardian consent, the parent/legal guardian agrees that his/her child's personal information may be shared with the MSG Family and Partners for purposes of offering discounts, promoting services and products, providing news on upcoming events, providing programming schedules, conducting surveys, providing special gift offerings, offering ticket discounts, and conducting games and sweepstakes. If a parent/legal guardian decides not to authorize the online collection and/or use of personal information as described in this privacy policy, the child will still be able to participate in such offerings, discounts, games and sweepstakes.
