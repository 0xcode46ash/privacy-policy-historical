This MSC.Software Online Privacy Statement ("Privacy Statement") applies to data collected by MSC.Software through its Web site and services. It does not apply to those MSC.Software sites, services and products that do not display or link to this statement or that have their own privacy statements.

The Web site [http://www.mscsoftware.com](http://www.mscsoftware.com/) is intended for use by MSC.Software's customers and other business partners. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about what kinds of information we may gather when you visit our site, how we may use the information, whether and when we may disclose it to third parties, and choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct the information.

MSC.Software is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.

 _ **Collection of Your Personal Information**_

When you browse our Web site, your IP address is automatically logged in order to give us an idea of which parts of our Web site you visit and how long you stay there. Your IP address is not linked to anything personally identifiable. The only other information automatically provided to us and provided by your web browser, is the type of computer and operating system you use to access this Web site.

We may ask you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your postcode, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. When you place an order from this Web site or request a quote, you'll be asked for information including your name, billing or shipping address or work e-mail address, work phone number, credit card information and other personal identifying information necessary to fill your order or provide the quotation. We will set up an account for you, which you may access when you want to order or get a quote.

When you become a registered user, the registration page will request you to input certain information, such as: your name, email address, street address, and a password you select.

 ** _Use of Your Personal Information_**

MSC.Software collects and uses your personal information to improve its sites and deliver the services or carry out the transactions you have requested. This may include providing you with more effective customer service, making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need to re-enter the same information repeatedly. When you submit your personal information to MSC.Software,you understand and agree that MSC.Software, its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates may transfer, store, and process your customer profile in any of the countries in which MSC.Software and its controlled affiliates maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States.

MSC.Software abides by the Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of data from the European Union.

 _ **Sharing of Your Personal Information**_

Except as described herein, we will not disclose your personal information outside of MSC.Software and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. MSC.Software may hire a third party to provide limited services on our behalf such as processing transactions or providing address verification software to confirm the address provided is a correct mailing address. Those companies are allowed to procure only the personal information needed to deliver the service, must keep confidential the information, and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

We obtain your permission to send you information about MSC.Software or our business partners. Where we collect contact information (for example, our user registration pages), we give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving certain information from our Company and/or our business partners, and to be removed from our mailing list. This includes the option to decline to receive such information from various MSC.Software sites. You may also contact us to inquire about these matters, or add or remove your name from our contact lists, by sending an email to www@mscsoftware.com.

The Company may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe it is necessary to comply with laws and legal process served on MSC.Software, protect and defend the rights or property of the Company, or act in emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of MSC.Software services or members of the public.

 _ **Accessing Your Personal Information**_

You will be given access to your personal information online to view, correct, amend, or delete inaccurate information, and will be required to sign in with your credentials (e-mails address and password). You can access and update your profile by visiting our Web site at <https://support.mscsoftware.com/misc/member_services.cfm>. If you have any questions in this regard, MSC.Software will respond to your request to access or delete personal information within 30 days as is required under the EU Safe Harbor program. Please notify us via our Web form to fulfill your request.

 _ **Security**_

MSC.Software is committed to securing your personal information. We have instituted Secure Socket Layer protocol ("SSL") to protect your Internet transactions. When you place orders or access your account information, we use the SSL to encrypt all your personal information, including sensitive information such as credit card numbers, so they cannot be read during Internet transmission. To confirm this, when you enter personal information during the registration or ordering processes, your browser will indicate that you have entered a secure page environment (look for a "lock" icon, and/or you will see that the URL has changed from "http:" to "https"). We use a secure licensed system for credit card authorization and fraud detection. Your credit card information is sent directly to our credit card service and referenced by your order number. We don't store your credit card information on our web site.

As a further protection, we do not store passwords in plain text. We store passwords encrypted. When you return for authentication, we encrypt the entered password and compare that to what is stored in the database. Since a password is used to help protect your personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential and not share the information with anyone. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  
 _ **  
Use of Cookies**_

Cookies are designed to help identify a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that were set before. A cookie is a small string of text transferred by a Web server to your browser. It cannot retrieve any data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your e-mail address. Many Web sites use cookies to enhance the user's visit. In general, cookies can securely store a user's ID and password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections in a "shopping cart."

We use transient or "session" cookies to track a registered user's session. A session cookie is a small file that contains information about a user that disappears when the user's browser is closed. Unlike a persistent cookie, a transient cookie is not stored on your hard drive. It is only stored in temporary memory and is erased once the browser is closed. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers will automatically accept cookies. If you chose to decline cookies, you may not be able to access or use other features of our Web site that depend on cookies.

We may use the information we get from cookies to evaluate and improve our Web site. We won't use the information transferred through cookies for promotion or marketing purposes, and it won't be shared with third parties. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. 

_**Links to Other Web Sites**_

As a convenience to you, we sometimes provide links to other, non-MSC.Software Web sites. These sites are not under the control of MSC.Software, and the fact that MSC.Software provides such links is not an indication that we endorse or are liable for those sites or their content. This Privacy Statement does not cover those linked sites. If you provide information to those company sites, that information will be subject to their privacy policies.

We maintain a relationship with Nexstra, a third-party provider of instructional manuals for MSC.Software. When you access a Nexstra page from our Site, you are subject to their privacy policy terms. We also partner with a co-branded third-party vendor who handles on our behalf, electronic download software delivery service center features on the Site. Under the arrangement between MSC.Software and the third-party vendor, in order for us to provide this service, we have passed on to the third-party vendor your name, e-mail address, company and company location information.

 _ **Changes to this Privacy Statement**_

We will, from time to time, periodically update this Privacy Statement as we continue to develop our Web site and improve the services we provide to you. When we post changes to this Privacy Statement, we will revise our "last updated" date at the bottom of this Privacy Statement. With regard to material changes to this statement or in how we use your personal information, we will notify you by way of e-mail or by posting a prominent notice on our Web site. We encourage you to periodically review our Privacy Statement to be informed of how we protect your personal information.

 _ **TRUSTe Certification**_

MSC.Software is a member of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. To demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have our privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through our Company's Web sites, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from such sites.
