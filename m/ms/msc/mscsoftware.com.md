#### Accessing Your Personal Information

You will be given access to your personal information online to view, correct, amend, or delete inaccurate information, and will be required to sign in with your credentials (e-mails address and password). You can access and update your profile by visiting our Web site at <https://support.mscsoftware.com/misc/member_services.cfm>. If you have any questions in this regard, MSC Software will respond to your request to access or delete personal information within 30 days as is required under the EU Safe Harbor program. Please notify us via our Web form to fulfill your request.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

#### Security

MSC Software is committed to securing your personal information. We have instituted Secure Socket Layer protocol ("SSL") to protect your Internet transactions. When you place orders or access your account information, we use the SSL to encrypt all your personal information, including sensitive information such as credit card numbers, so they cannot be read during Internet transmission. To confirm this, when you enter personal information during the registration or ordering processes, your browser will indicate that you have entered a secure page environment (look for a "lock" icon, and/or you will see that the URL has changed from "http:" to "https"). We use a secure licensed system for credit card authorization and fraud detection. Your credit card information is sent directly to our credit card service and referenced by your order number. We don't store your credit card information on our web site.

As a further protection, we do not store passwords in plain text. We store passwords encrypted. When you return for authentication, we encrypt the entered password and compare that to what is stored in the database. Since a password is used to help protect your personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential and not share the information with anyone. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

#### Use of Cookies

Cookies are designed to help identify a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that were set before. A cookie is a small string of text transferred by a Web server to your browser. It cannot retrieve any data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your e-mail address. Many Web sites use cookies to enhance the user's visit. In general, cookies can securely store a user's ID and password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections in a "shopping cart."

We use transient or "session" cookies to track a registered user's session. A session cookie is a small file that contains information about a user that disappears when the user's browser is closed. Unlike a persistent cookie, a transient cookie is not stored on your hard drive. It is only stored in temporary memory and is erased once the browser is closed. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers will automatically accept cookies. If you chose to decline cookies, you may not be able to access or use other features of our Web site that depend on cookies.

We may use the information we get from cookies to evaluate and improve our Web site. We won't use the information transferred through cookies for promotion or marketing purposes, and it won't be shared with third parties. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personal information.

We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personal information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.

#### Links to Other Web Sites

As a convenience to you, we sometimes provide links to other, non-MSC Software Web sites. These sites are not under the control of MSC Software, and the fact that MSC Software provides such links is not an indication that we endorse or are liable for those sites or their content. This Privacy Statement does not cover those linked sites. If you provide information to those company sites, that information will be subject to their privacy policies.

We maintain a relationship with Nexstra, a third-party provider of instructional manuals for MSC Software. When you access a Nexstra page from our Site, you are subject to their privacy policy terms. We also partner with a co-branded third-party vendor who handles on our behalf, electronic download software delivery service center features on the Site. Under the arrangement between MSC Software and the third-party vendor, in order for us to provide this service, we have passed on to the third-party vendor your name, e-mail address, company and company location information.

These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

#### Changes to this Privacy Statement

We will, from time to time, periodically update this Privacy Statement as we continue to develop our Web site and improve the services we provide to you. When we post changes to this Privacy Statement, we will revise our "last updated" date at the bottom of this Privacy Statement.
