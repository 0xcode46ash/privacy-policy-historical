### **MSC.Software Website Privacy Policy**

**MSC.Software Privacy Policy**

Your privacy is very important to us, and we take our privacy commitment to our website users very seriously. Our goal is to protect your online privacy while delivering a useful and enjoyable online experience that provides the information, products and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. 

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about what kinds of information we may gather when you visit our site, how we may use that information, whether and when we may disclose it to third parties, and choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. 

MSC.Software Corporation (MSC.Software) reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add to or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this policy page periodically for changes. Your continued use of this website, including usage following the posting of changes to this policy, means you accept this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use this site.

**Information Collection and Usage**

_Automatically Collected Information_ : When you browse our site, your IP address is logged in order to give us an idea of which parts of our web site you visit and how long you stay there. Your IP address isn't linked to anything personally identifiable. The only other information automatically provided to us is the type of computer and operating system you use to access this site, and your web browser provides this information. 

_Other Information Collected_ : 

When you place an order from this site or request a quote, you'll be asked for information including your name, shipping or email address and credit card information necessary to fill your order or provide the quotation. We will set up an account for you, which you may access when you want to order or get a quote. 

When you become a registered user, the registration page will request you to input certain information, such as: your name, email address, street address, and a password you select.

Note About Passwords: As a further protection, we do not store passwords in plain text. We store passwords encrypted. When you come back for authentication, we encrypt the entered password and compare that to what is stored in the database.

_What We Do With Information We Collect_ :

We use a secure licensed system for credit card authorization and fraud detection. Your credit card information is sent directly to our credit card service and referenced by your order number. We don't store your credit card information on our web site.

MSC.Software may use the information you provide us for internal research or to improve our site and services. This information won't be provided to third parties, except as otherwise provided in this policy. All information you input is protected against unauthorized access, both in house and by third parties.

_Will We Share or Disclose Your Information?_ We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties. We may send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people:

  * When we have your consent to share the information;
  * When we need to share the information with companies who work on behalf of MSC.Software for purposes of providing a product or service you have requested (and only for that purpose, unless we tell you differently);
  * To process your credit card payments for products or services, we securely transmit necessary information (account number, billing address, etc.) to an online payment processor service;
  * When we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes;
  * When we make reports to law enforcement, or as requested by a government agency conducting investigations or proceedings;
  * If we find that your conduct on our web sites violate any of our terms of use, or similar or other rules governing site usage, user conduct, or any of our other policies or usage guidelines regarding specific products or services;
  * If we must collect on debts; or

On pages on this site where we collect contact information (for example, our user registration pages), we give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving certain information from MSC.Software and/or our business partners. This includes the option to decline to receive such information as updates on products and services, special promotions, and newsletters from various MSC.Software sites. You may also contact us to inquire about these matters, or add or remove your name from our contact lists, by sending an email to www@mscsoftware.com 

**Cookies**

_What is a cookie?_ Cookies were originally designed to help a web site identify a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that were set before. A cookie is a small string of text a web site sends to your browser. It can't retrieve any data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your E-mail address. Many web sites use cookies to enhance the user's visit; in general, cookies can securely store a user's ID and password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections in a "shopping cart." 

_How do we use cookies?_ We use transient or "session" cookies to track a registered user's session. A session cookie is a small file that contains information about a user that disappears when the user's browser is closed. Unlike a persistent cookie, a transient cookie is not stored on your hard drive. It is only stored in temporary memory and is erased once the browser is closed. Users who have registered memberships with any of the Engineering-e.com sites or subscribed to any applications will need to have their browser enabled to accept cookies in order to access sections of each Engineering-e.com site.

Engineering-e.com uses session cookies for a number of purposes, such as to allow a user access to his or her information at the time of signing in or to use tools or services available only to members. Engineering-e.com requires you to sign in after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing the contents of your account.

If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Engineering-e.com's products or services that require you to "sign in." It is also likely that you may not be able to take full advantage of each site's offerings.

We may use the information we get from cookies to evaluate and improve our web site. We won't use the information transferred through cookies for promotion or marketing purposes, and it won't be shared with third parties. 

**Security**

MSC.Software has instituted secure server software (SSL) to protect your Internet transactions. When you place orders or access your account information we use the secure server software to encrypt all your personal information, including credit card numbers, so they cannot be read during Internet transmission. To confirm this, when you enter personal information during the registration or ordering processes, your browser will indicate that you've entered a secure page environment (look for a "lock" icon, and/or you will see that the URL has changed to from "http:" to "https").

We use a secure licensed system for credit card authorization and fraud detection. Your credit card information is sent directly to our credit card service and referenced by your order number. We don't store your credit card information on our web site. 

For further details about security on this MSC.Software site, please see our Security Policy.

**Your Ability to Review or Change Your Personal Information**

We encourage our users to update and edit their personal information and keep it current. To do so, please go to the [Member Services](https://www.engineering-e.com/cgi-bin/register/signinform.pl?CASE=protected&refer=https://www.engineering-e.com/misc/member_services.cfm?) page.

**Links to Other Sites**

As a convenience to you, we sometimes provide links to other, non-MSC.Software websites. These sites are not under the control of MSC.Software, and the fact that MSC.Software provides such links is not an indication that we endorse or are liable for those sites or their content. This Privacy Policy does not cover those linked sites. If you provide information to those companies' sites, that information will be subject to their privacy policies.
