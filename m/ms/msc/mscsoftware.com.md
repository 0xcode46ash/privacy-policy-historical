**  
Cookies**  
  
_What is a cookie?_ Cookies were originally designed to help a web site identify a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that were set before. A cookie is a small string of text a web site sends to your browser. It can't retrieve any data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your E-mail address. Many web sites use cookies to enhance the user's visit; in general, cookies can securely store a user's ID and password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections in a "shopping cart." 

_How do we use cookies?_ We use transient or "session" cookies to track a registered user's session. A session cookie is a small file that contains information about a user that disappears when the user's browser is closed. Unlike a persistent cookie, a transient cookie is not stored on your hard drive. It is only stored in temporary memory and is erased once the browser is closed. Users who have registered memberships with any of the Engineering-e.com sites or subscribed to any applications will need to have their browser enabled to accept cookies in order to access sections of each Engineering-e.com site.

|   | 

Engineering-e.com uses session cookies for a number of purposes, such as to allow a user access to his or her information at the time of signing in or to use tools or services available only to members. Engineering-e.com requires you to sign in after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing the contents of your account.

If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Engineering-e.com's products or services that require you to "sign in." It is also likely that you may not be able to take full advantage of each site's offerings.

We may use the information we get from cookies to evaluate and improve our web site. We won't use the information transferred through cookies for promotion or marketing purposes, and it won't be shared with third parties.   
  
**  
Security**  
MSC.Software has instituted secure server software (SSL) to protect your Internet transactions. When you place orders or access your account information we use the secure server software to encrypt all your personal information, including credit card numbers, so they cannot be read during Internet transmission. To confirm this, when you enter personal information during the registration or ordering processes, your browser will indicate that you've entered a secure page environment (look for a "lock" icon, and/or you will see that the URL has changed to from "http:" to "https"). |   | 

We use a secure licensed system for credit card authorization and fraud detection. Your credit card information is sent directly to our credit card service and referenced by your order number. We don't store your credit card information on our web site. 

For further details about security on this MSC.Software site, please see our Security Policy.

Your Ability to Review or Change Your Personal Information**  
We encourage our users to update and edit their personal information and keep it current. To do so, please go to the [Member Services](https://www.engineering-e.com/cgi-bin/register/signinform.pl?CASE=protected&refer=https://www.engineering-e.com/misc/member_services.cfm?) page.

Links to Other Sites**  
As a convenience to you, we sometimes provide links to other, non-MSC.Software websites. These sites are not under the control of MSC.Software, and the fact that MSC.Software provides such links is not an indication that we endorse or are liable for those sites or their content.  |   |  This Privacy Policy does not cover those linked sites.
