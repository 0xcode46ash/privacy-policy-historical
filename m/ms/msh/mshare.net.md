**GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY**  
This Privacy Policy discloses the information practices of InMoment, Inc. formerly Mindshare Technologies, Inc. and its affiliate, Empathica Inc. dba InMoment (collectively “InMoment”, “we”, or “us”) relating to our web sites and web/text surveys, reporting engines (collectively the “Sites”), phone surveys, data collection and any other methods of interacting with us. A separate privacy policy is set forth below for InMoment’s GoRecommend program and application.

Your privacy is important to you and to us, and we are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy was created in order to comply with the Privacy Act (1974), the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and any other relevant legislation. To the extent there is additional protection afforded to you pursuant to the law, which is not set forth herein, we agree to take such measures to give full effect to such additional protection.

**Safe Harbor-Compliant Affirmative Commitment**  
InMoment complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. InMoment has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor Frameworks, and to view InMoment’s certification, please visit [http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/)

**InMoment’s Clients and How This Relates to Your Privacy**  
InMoment is a software as a service (SaaS) provider for companies conducting data collection activities via telephone, the Internet, text messaging, comment cards, mystery shopping, internal audits and other data collection methods. Following collection, the information is analyzed and reported on. These activities are primarily targeting customer and employee satisfaction issues, but may also include market, product, and service research, as well as other types of research. Surveys and data collection may be hosted and accessible on InMoment’s ASP Hosting site, or on our clients’ own hosting sites. Reports are processed and printed each day that may provide our clients with your Personal Information for the purpose of improving their operations and/or contacting you to follow up on your service experience, and/or the information you provided. Be aware that InMoment’s clients have full access to the data, and therefore bear full responsibility for usage of that data. In such cases, please refer to the privacy policy of the InMoment client who invited you to provide information and feedback.

**What is Personal Information?**  
Personal Information is information about an identifiable individual. It may include your full name, address, zip code, telephone number, date of birth, email address, demographic/classification information (e.g. education or age), and any other information that identifies who you are or would allow someone to contact you. It also may include client program membership or loyalty numbers. Your contact information may be used as required to follow up on your feedback so you can be contacted by client employees or representatives. Personal Information only becomes known to InMoment when you voluntarily provide it to us, or it is provided to InMoment by the InMoment client that invited you to take a survey.

**Collection and Use of Personal Information**  
We will not collect any Personal Information from you that you do not volunteer. Participation in surveys or other data collection is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to respond and whether or not to disclose any requested information. We do not sell, share, or rent Personal Information to third parties unless you expressly agree to have InMoment share your Personal Information as described below.

If you choose to take a survey, register, or submit personally identifiable information to us, you agree to the use of such information in accordance with this privacy policy. If you elect not to provide your Personal Information to us, you will be ineligible to participate in any incentive contest that is offered on the Sites. If you have already submitted Personal Information and would like us to remove it from our records, or if you would like to know what Personal Information is held in our records, see the Contact section below.

**Telephone ANI Visibility**  
When you dial a toll-free number in the United States, the party you are calling pays for the call. The called party is able to identify your telephone number using a telephone network technology called Automatic Number Identification (ANI). FCC rules limit parties that own toll-free numbers from distributing the telephone numbers identified through ANI and require telephone companies to inform customers that their telephone numbers are being transmitted to toll-free numbers in this way. If you take a InMoment telephone survey, both InMoment and its clients may have access to your ANI, but, per FCC rules, will not distribute that telephone number further.

**IP Addresses and Cookies**  
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Sites. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. Our Sites may use cookies to make sure you don’t access the same survey repeatedly and to determine the browser the visitor uses so the Sites can be designed to work properly with the most common versions of different browsers. If used, these cookies are not linked to any Personal Information. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Sites; however, you may not be able to access all areas or features.

A cookie is a small file that is placed on your device which enables a server to identify that device and allows us to offer the best services possible. Cookies are commonly used on the Internet and do not harm your computer system.

We may, from time to time, use cookies, pixel tags, action tags or similar technologies for various purposes including:

  * Collating anonymous aggregated information that is used to manage and plan enhancements to our services; 
  * To evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions on third party websites, for example by tracking whether these advertisements are clicked on by users; and 
  * To assist in the provision of ads which are relevant to you when browsing the internet. 



InMoment occasionally works with third parties to research certain usage and activities on our website. No personal information about you is shared. 

_How can I stop cookies and what effect will this have?  
_ You can stop cookies from being deployed on your computer by configuring your browser not to accept them. Please refer to your browser’s ‘help’ function. If cookies are already on your system, you can delete them – For more information on cookies and deletion of cookies please visit: http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies.

InMoment imposes strict internal controls over employees with access to Customer Information. Such access is granted only on a need-to-know basis.

InMoment will retain Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws, and your consent to such purposes(s) will remain valid after termination of our interaction with you.

InMoment conducts business globally, with people, processes, and systems that cross borders.
