# Privacy and Cookies

## Privacy & Cookies

Majestic is committed to respecting and protecting our customers' privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully in accordance with such legislation as the Data Protection Act 1998 and Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications 2003.

### Your personal details

When you register on our website or provide us with your details in-store we will collect some of your personal details. You may choose to be added to our postal mailing list to receive our seasonal promotions, and also may subscribe to email newsletters. The information we collect is just for Majestic Wine Warehouses Ltd and other companies in the Majestic Wine PLC group: we do not release your information to third parties (other than where necessary to perform a service, such as courier companies carrying out deliveries). We will not email you unless you have given us your consent, and you have the option not to be included and to remove yourself from our mailing lists at any time.

We collect information about you for two reasons: firstly, to process your order and second, to provide you with the best possible service. The type of information we may collect about you includes:

  * Your name
  * Address
  * Telephone number
  * E-mail address
  * Credit/debit card details
  * Your previous purchase history



We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. The information we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check the information that we hold about you by emailing us at [info@majestic.co.uk](mailto:info@majestic.co.uk). If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly.

The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the law. Information may be transferred outside the European Economic Area to the United States of America (where our agents will operate under European Union Safe Harbor Framework). By submitting your information, you consent to this transfer.

### Crime prevention

For the purposes of the prevention or detection of offences, and/or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, we may share any information that we collect with the Police, other public or private sector agencies or representative bodies in accordance with the relevant legislation. Information shared in this way will not be used for marketing purposes.

Please be aware that CCTV is in operation in all our stores and at our head office and delivery depot.

### Cookies and online privacy

In common with most websites, majestic.co.uk uses "cookies". Cookies are small snippets of text that are stored on your computer. When you request a page from our website, the cookies are sent to our web server, and when we send a page back to you our server may add to or change these cookies. Without cookies, we would not be able to know that you are the same person from page to page. We do not store anything that could identify you personally in cookies; instead we store codes and references which can only be connected to your personal details by our own systems.

We use cookies for a variety of reasons, such as remembering the contents of your shopping trolley, your preferences such as your local store, and displaying the products you've recently viewed. We also use analytics software, which allows us to track and measure patterns of behaviour among our users so that we can improve our website.

Additionally, we have partnerships with some carefully chosen third party services which involve including some code on our website, for example so that we can jointly measure the effectiveness of our marketing activities or enable you to share content with your friends. In some cases these partners may also store and retrieve their own cookies on your computer. Cookies set by websites other than majestic.co.uk are known as "third party cookies".

In accordance with the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications 2003, and to be as open and transparent as possible, we have provided more information on the cookies in use on majestic.co.uk here (including our blog at blog.majestic.co.uk and Careers website at careers.majestic.co.uk). These details may change over time as we continue to develop our website, and we are investing in finding ways to reduce our use of cookies whilst continuing to deliver the best experience possible for our customers.

We have grouped our cookies into four categories:

  1. **Strictly Necessary** : these cookies are essential to the operation of our site.
  2. **Performance** : these cookies allow us to monitor the performance of our website in a non-personally identifiable way.
  3. **Functionality** : these cookies allow us to add services to enhance user experience and remember settings, but will not be used by third parties to track you personally.
  4. **Targeting** : these cookies are used by third parties to provide services, such as social networks and advertising networks who may use the information obtained to serve relevant adverts to you.



You can change the settings in your web browser to allow or deny different websites from setting cookies. Please note that disabling "first party cookies" from majestic.co.uk will affect the successful functioning of the site, and you will not be able to use the shopping trolley or checkout. For more information on cookies, see [allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

### Email Tracking

Some emails we send include tracking codes so that we can tell how many people open and click on links in those emails. Usually this information is used for aggregated statistics, but we can also track, at an individual level, whether a particular user has opened and clicked on an email. Using cookies as described above we can also determine if a particular user has completed a transaction. Sometimes we use this information to re-email people who didn't click the first time, or who did or didn't complete a purchase. If you want to be sure that none of your email activity is tracked in this way then you should not subscribe to our email mailing list. Existing subscribers can unsubscribe using the link at the bottom of every marketing email we send.

If you have any further questions about this, please email us at [info@majestic.co.uk](mailto:info@majestic.co.uk) and we will be happy to help.
