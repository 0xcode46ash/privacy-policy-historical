# Privacy Policy

## 

Majestic customers can choose to be added to our postal mailing list and receive updated full colour price lists and other relevant information on our seasonal promotions. Customers may also subscribe to email newsletters.

Majestic has always held a customer database, and we have never given the details to anyone else. We do not release information to third parties, and you have the option not to be included and to remove yourself from our mailing lists at any time.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications 2003.

We collect information about you for 2 reasons: firstly, to process your order and second, to provide you with the best possible service.

We will not e-mail you in the future unless you have given us your consent in accordance with the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications 2003. We will give you the chance to refuse any marketing email from us or from another trader in the future. The type of information we will collect about you includes:

  * Your name
  * Address
  * Telehone number
  * E-mail address
  * Credit/debit card details



We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. The information we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check the information that we hold about you by emailing us at [info@majestic.co.uk](mailto:info@majestic.co.uk). If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly.

The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the law. If we intend to transfer your information outside the EEA (European Economic Area) we will always obtain your consent first.

### Cookies

We use "cookies", which are small pieces of information that enable us to track your visit to our website from page to page. Cookies which are set by majestic.co.uk (which are known as "first party cookies") are used for several reasons:

  * To enable the shopping trolley - without cookies, we cannot tell you are the same person from one page to the next.
  * To personalise our website to you, such as remembering your local store, and displaying the products you've recently viewed.
  * To track and measure patterns of behaviour among our users so that we can improve our website.



Additionally, some cookies may be stored by our partners when you click through to our website, so that we can jointly measure the effectiveness of some of our marketing activities (which are known as "third party cookies").

You can usually modify your browser to prevent this happening. However, please note that disabling "first party cookies" from majestic.co.uk will affect the successful functioning of the site, and you will not be able to use the shopping trolley or checkout. For more information on cookies, see [allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

#### Crime prevention

For the purposes of the prevention or detection of offences, and/or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, we may share any information that we collect with the Police, other public or private sector agencies or representative bodies in accordance with the relevant legislation. Information shared in this way will not be used for marketing purposes.

If you have any further questions about this, please email us at [info@majestic.co.uk](mailto:info@majestic.co.uk) and we will be happy to help.
