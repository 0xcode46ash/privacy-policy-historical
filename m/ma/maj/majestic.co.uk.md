Majestic customers can choose to be added to our postal mailing list and receive updated full colour price lists and other relevant information on our seasonal promotions. Customers may also subscribe to email newsletters. 

Majestic has always held a customer database, and we have never given the details to anyone else. We do not release information to third parties, and you have the option not to be included and to remove yourself from our mailing lists at any time.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications 2003.

We collect information about you for 2 reasons: firstly, to process your order and second, to provide you with the best possible service.
