# Mawindo

**Website Visitors**  
Like most website operators, Mawindo collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Mawindo’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Mawindo’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Mawindo may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.  
Mawindo also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Mawindo does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

  
**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**  
Certain visitors to Mawindo’s websites choose to interact with Mawindo in ways that require Mawindo to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Mawindo gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Mawindo does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

  
**Aggregated Statistics**  
Mawindo may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites and  may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Mawindo does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

  
**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**  
Mawindo discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Mawindo’s behalf or to provide services available at Mawindo’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Mawindo’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Mawindo will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Mawindo discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Mawindo believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Mawindo, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Mawindo website and have supplied your email address, Mawindo may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Mawindo and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Mawindo takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Our Policy Towards Children

The Site is not directed to persons under 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us at info at mawindo dot com. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal identifiable information, we will delete such information from our files.
