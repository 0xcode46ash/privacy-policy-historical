This is the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) Internet Privacy Policy, which discloses the privacy practices of [www.maa.org](http://www.maa.org/).

At MAA, we place the highest importance on respecting and protecting the privacy of our members and customers. You are our most important asset and we value our relationship with you. We want you to feel comfortable and confident when using our Web site. Therefore, we would like to share with you the following principles that govern our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web site.

#### We Protect Your Information

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We work to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration by using industry-recognized security safeguards. We use both internal and external resources to review our security procedures. Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information.

#### Data Retention

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at [maaservice@maa.org](mailto:maaservice@maa.org). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

#### We Tell You How We Use Your Information

When we ask you for information, we will tell you – or it will be clear – what we need to know to fulfill your request and how the information you provide to us will be used. For example, if you become a member or order a product from us, we will ask you for your name and contact information such as mailing address, phone number, credit card information, and e-mail address. In addition to responding to your request, we use your contact information to communicate with you. We also tell you about products or services we think might interest you or to invite you to participate in a product or service-related survey.

#### We Tell You About Our Relationships With Third Parties

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

We have limited relationships with third parties to assist us in servicing you, for example, by fulfilling customer orders, providing customer service or delivering subscription content. These service providers are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide them. When you request any of these products or services, you are permitting us to provide your personal information to the contractor to fulfill your request. We may disclose your information if we are required to by a law enforcement action such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant.
