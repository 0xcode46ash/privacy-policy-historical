# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is one of our top priorities. This policy informs you of the information that we collect from you at this site, what we do with it, to whom it may be disseminated, and how you can access it. Based on this information, you can make an informed decision about your use of this site. 

 Limited Scope of this Policy  
The privacy policy which follows applies only to the use of this website. As you navigate this website, you will see links that, when clicked, will take you to other websites operated by other state agencies. These websites have individual privacy policies tailored to the interactions available through that site. You may also see links that will take you to websites external to Massachusetts state government. We strongly suggest that you read the privacy policies for each Commonwealth website that you visit and any external site that you visit through any link appearing at this site.

 Personally Identifiable Information  
We use the term "personally identifiable information" to mean any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, Social Security number, birth date, bank account information, credit card information, or any combination of information that could be used to identify you.

 Information Voluntarily Provided by You  
This site may collect voluntary information from you through email messages you choose to send to the General Court.  
 Any email messages sent by you to this site will contain personally identifiable information such as your email address and any other information you choose to give us to help us answer your inquiry.

  Information Automatically Collected and Stored by this Site  
This website does not use permanent "cookies."  However, the site uses temporary "session cookies" to allow visitors to interact with the site and to use online applications. "Session cookies" do not allow us to personally identify a visitor. These cookies are stored only in memory and are deleted when the user's browser is shut down.  
This site does collect and store your "Internet Protocol (IP) address" (which does not identify you as an individual) indefinitely, as well as information about the date and time of your visit, whether a file you have requested exists, and how many "bytes" of information were transmitted to you over the Web from this site. We use your IP address to assess the frequency of visits to this site and the popularity of its various pages and functions. We will not attempt to match any personally identifiable information that you provide to us with your IP address.

 Dissemination of Your Personally Identifiable Information  
We do not sell any personally identifiable information collected through this website.   
We will collect and aggregate the information you provide through email messages for the purposes of ensuring that this website is as accurate and helpful as possible.  Where appropriate, we may provide the information submitted by you through an email to the person or office responsible for the matters referred to in your communication.

 Security  
Because email sent to the General Court is not encrypted, you should not send messages containing information that you consider highly sensitive to this website. We use standard security measures to ensure that information provided by you, including your personally identifiable information, is not lost, misused, altered, or unintentionally destroyed. We also use software to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits.

 Policy Changes  
This policy reflects the General Court’s current practices, but is subject to change without notice. 

 Contact Information  
For questions about your privacy while using the website of the General Court, please contact [webmaster@MaLegislature.gov](mailto:webmaster@MaLegislature.gov).

 Definitions  
Cookies are files that a website can place on your computer. A cookie file contains unique information that a website can use to track such things as your password, lists of Web pages you have visited, and the date when you last looked at a specific Web page, or to identify your session at a particular website. A cookie file allows the website to recognize you as you click through pages on the site and when you later revisit the site. A website can use cookies to "remember" your preferences, and to record your browsing behavior on the Web. Although you can prevent websites from placing cookies on your computer by using your browser's preference menu, disabling cookies may affect your ability to view or interact with some websites.  
An "Internet Protocol Address" or "IP Address" is a series of numbers that identifies each computer and machine connected to the Internet. An IP address enables a server on a computer network to send you the file that you have requested on the Internet. The IP address disclosed to us may identify the computer from which you are accessing the Internet, or a server owned by your Internet Service Provider. Because it is machine-specific, rather than person-specific, an IP address is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable information
