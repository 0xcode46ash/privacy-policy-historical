# Privacy policy

Main Content

> **  
> ** Not much, is the answer! The only personal data we ask for from users is their name, country, telephone, fax and e-mail address. It's the stuff you see on the join form, [**see it here**](https://www.mals-e.com/join.php). Of that only the Contact e-mail address is really absolutely essential, we don't mind if people don't want to provide the other stuff. All this data can be updated at any time in Admin (go to _Your details_ ). 
> 
> If you have a Premium account then we will have your payment details stored in a **Billing account**. This will include your name, address, e-mail address and possibly your card details (if that is how you have elected to pay). European businesses will be required to provide a their tax number too (VAT number). All communications between you and your myMal account is over SSL, the financial data is stored encrypted. You may view and update any part of it by logging into your Billing account the details of which are e-mailed to you when you first create it. 
> 
> From the moment you enter Admin your activities may be logged. Tracking is via cookie and IP address. This information may be used proactively to develop a profile of your behaviour. It is collected purely for the purpose of ensuring your own security. For example, if you try to login too many times with the wrong password then you may be blocked from further attempts. You cannot enter Admin without cookies enabled.
> 
> For information about cookies see the Help file that comes with your browser. As a general rule we only ever use session (memory resident) cookies, they "die" when you close down your browser. **  
> ** We don't have a mailing list and we don't make any sort of mass mailings to users. We use the Contact e-mail address only when we need to contact a user about an operational matter. If you have a Premium account holder you will receive a renewal notice when you paid up period is over. It is sent to the e-mail address in your Billing account. 
> 
> Data such as a users country and business type is purely for statistical analysis. We keep it so that we can make sure we're targeting our resources in the right places. We don't have any advertising on this site, we don't sell data to anyone else. It's just for us.
> 
> Note: SMTP (e-mail) is not an encrypted protocol. When we use an e-mail address it passes across the internet unencrypted...  
>  **  
> ** No one except employees of Mal's e-commerce limited. Our host [**Rackspace.com**](http://www.rackspace.com/) have physical access to the servers too of course. 
> 
> There is a "Mall" with links to users websites, it is entirely voluntary to join. In addition some users publish information about their site as part of a post in the User Group Forum. But apart from these "self-disclosures" **there are no circumstances under which we would pass on any details about a user to a third-party**. Very occasionally we help a customer contact a merchant but we do so only after very carefully considering their request.
> 
> ****This Web site contains some links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Mal's e-commerce Limited. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of them. You should read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.
> 
> This privacy statement applies only to information collected by Mal's e-commerce Limited.   
>  **  
> ** In the (unlikely) event Mal's e-commerce Limited goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified by prominent notice on our Web site, for 30 days, of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.  
>  **  
> Changes in this Privacy Statement** If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. ****We do not keep customer data beyond the routine back-up of the live database which is made for purely operational reasons. Customer data belongs to the merchant, not to Mal's e-commerce Limited, we just store it for you temporarily on our hard disks. There are no circumstances under which we would pass on customer data to anyone other than the merchant to whom it belongs.
