# Malwarebytes : Privacy Policy

**Last updated: November 1, 2010**

At Malwarebytes we recognize that privacy is important. This document outlines the types of personal information we receive and collect when you use Malwarebytes' services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard information. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about using our products.

## Users Under the Age of 18

Malwarebytes does not knowingly solicit information from users under the age of 18. Malwarebytes has instructed its payment processing partners to take all steps required by law to ensure that minors who purchase its products have obtained proper parental consent before doing so.

**If you are under the age of 18 and wish to participate in the Malwarebytes forum or purchase any Malwarebytes products, please obtain your parent or guardian's permission before submitting any personal information to Malwarebytes.**

## Website and Forum Visitors

As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information. For example, visitors may view most of the threads on our help forum without signing up for a user name or providing any personal information.

Those who wish to sign up for the Malwarebytes forum or use certain online or hosted products and services may do so by voluntarily filling out and submitting a user information form. It is optional for users to engage in these activities, but for those who wish to do so, filling out certain fields in the user forms will be mandatory. Many of our user forms also ask users to submit additional information voluntarily. The user forms label which information is mandatory. Users who do not provide the mandatory data in the user form for a particular activity will not be able to engage in that activity.

Malwarebytes may also collect certain information about users' computers when they access the Malwarebytes website or use certain other products and services. This information is used to facilitate and evaluate your use of the Malwarebytes website or other products and services. For example, we may track what web browser a website visitor uses to ensure that all of the website features work properly in that browser environment. We may also log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, referring or exit webpages, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of users' computers. Malwarebytes also uses such information to measure traffic patterns on the Site and usage of the Products and Services. We do not match such information with any other information held by Malwarebytes unless we have a user's consent.

## Software Users

In addition to information collected by our website and user forms, Malwarebytes software also collects certain additional information from users of our Anti-Malware software. In particular, Malwarebytes keeps a record of all malware that its products detect, including specific information about the way the malware functions, how to identify it, and where the threat originates. Data about specific malware is reported anonymously, so Malwarebytes cannot link it back to specific users' computers.

This information is important to allow Malwarebytes to better protect all of its users against threats as soon as they emerge. Malwarebytes' software also sends data to our servers concerning how many users are logging on to the server at any given time and what version of Malwarebytes the users are running. These usage statistics help Malwarebytes keep its software running smoothly and minimize service interruptions. Much of this information is collected in the aggregate, with no way for Malwarebytes to track individual users' information.

Lastly, for users of the full version of Malwarebytes' software, Malwarebytes does track usage of its licenses to protect against software piracy and malicious companies who attempt to circumvent Malwarebytes protection by using stolen license keys.

## Your Agreement to this Privacy Policy

By using this Site and our other products and services, you agree and acknowledge that personal information collected through the Site or in connection with the Products and Services may be transferred across national boundaries and stored and processed in any of the countries around the world in which Malwarebytes maintains offices, including the United States.
