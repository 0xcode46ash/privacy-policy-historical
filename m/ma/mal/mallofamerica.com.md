# Mall of America | Terms & Privacy

MOAC Mall Holdings LLC and its parent company and affiliates (“Mall of America®”) are committed to protecting your privacy and demonstrating care and respect with regard to our treatment of any personal information that we may obtain from you. The purpose of this privacy policy is to explain how we collect, protect, use and share information gathered about you on our websites.

The majority of the features on our websites are offered without collecting any personally identifiable information from you. You can surf our websites and view our content anonymously.

### Log Files

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer our websites, to track users’ movements around our websites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

### Aggregate Information (Non-Personally Identifiable)

We use Google Analytics to monitor traffic on our websites. Such monitoring helps us to provide the kind of user-friendly, up-to-date information that online users expect to find. Under no circumstances is personally identifiable information of any kind monitored or collected through this process. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.

### Cookies

We use a variety of technologies on our sites. Among these are cookies: a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember your browser in the future. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a unique number. When you visit our website, open our email, or encounter our services online (perhaps on a customer's website) we may send you a cookie. Cookies may be used in many ways: they allow us to verify the login status of customers using products or services linked directly with our website, track point of entry to point of registration for those users participating in our affiliate signup programs, and track and measure the success of a particular marketing campaign. Cookies also allow us to track overall site usage and determine areas users prefer, enabling us to make your visit to our website easier by recognizing you when you return and helping to provide you with a customized experience.

Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. If you choose to disable cookies, you may still use our site; however, you may have limited access to some areas within our website. For more information on how to manage cookies in your web browser, see [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).

Some of our web pages, emails, and other online content may contain electronic images known as web beacons, also known as single-pixel GIFs, which are invisible graphical images. These web beacons allow us to count users who have visited our web pages, seen our ads, or opened our email. Web beacons collect only limited information, such as a cookie identifier, time and date of a page being viewed, and a description of the page on which the Web Beacon resides (the URL). When we send you emails, we may include a web beacon to allow us to determine the number of people who open our emails. When you click on a link in an email, we record this individual response to allow us to customize our offerings to you. Web Beacons cannot be declined when delivered via a regular web page; however, Web Beacons can be refused when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive Web Beacons via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) emails via your email software.

### Personally Identifiable Information

We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), and to send participants an email newsletter.

We work with Constant Contact as a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests. Constant Contact is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

### Surveys or Contests

From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our websites. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

### How Information is Shared

We share Personally Identifiable Information with third parties only for our internal business purposes. We do not give, sell, or lend personally identifiable information regarding visitors to our websites to third parties for any other reason. We require any third parties with whom we share personally identifiable information to protect this information using the same degree of care that we do. We occasionally send emails announcing special offers or services on behalf of our business partners to users who have given us personally identifiable information, but the participating business partner has no direct access to the personally identifiable user information contained in our databases.

### Agents

We use an outside company to fulfill orders and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.

### Legal Disclaimer

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe that disclosure is necessary to enforce or apply our Terms & Conditions of Use, protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our websites and as required by law.

### Choice / Opt-Out

We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing materials from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at [newsletter@mallofamerica.com](mailto:newsletter@mallofamerica.com) or you may contact us at 952-883-8810 or write us to opt-out:

Mall of America  
Attn: Interactive Marketing  
60 E Broadway  
Bloomington, MN 55425

You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.

### Links to Other Sites

Our websites may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Mall of America. Please be aware that Mall of America is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our websites and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by our websites.

### Uses of Information

We use personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways. We use the information to complete transactions. For instance if you purchase an item from www.shopnicku.com, we use your information to process your order or if you contact us for help we will use the information to contact you. We use information collected to notify you if you've won a contest. Information we collect is used to send you e-mail updates and newsletters about our site.

We do not obtain personal information about you other than that which you choose to provide, and we will not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose the personal information you provide to anyone outside of Mall of America except as necessary to enforce or apply our Terms & Conditions of Use, protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our websites and as required by law.

### Access to Personally Identifiable Information

If you’re personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update, delete or unsubscribe by making the change on our member information page, by emailing our Customer Support at [privacy@mallofamerica.com](mailto:privacy@mallofamerica.com) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail using the information in the CONTACT US section of this privacy policy.

### Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Your credit card information, as well as your personal information, is converted into tiny bits of encrypted code that cannot be read by others during transmission. Our servers use this SSL technology to protect your information.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our websites, you can email us at [privacy@mallofamerica.com](mailto:privacy@mallofamerica.com) or contact us by telephone or postal mail as indicated in the CONTACT US section of this privacy policy.

### Business Transitions

In the event Mall of America goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

### Changes in This Privacy Statement

Please note that this Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect that most revisions will be minor. Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the bottom of the Privacy Policy by its effective date, and we will keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.

### Children’s Privacy Notice

Mall of America has created a separate section of its Privacy Policy to set out its policies and procedures with regard to young children (children under the age of 13.) Mall of America recognizes that young children are especially vulnerable and is fully committed to compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). For our Children’s Privacy Notice, when we refer to a parent we are referring to the parents or legal guardians of a child.

### Who Collects Information

Mall of America and its service provider are responsible for collecting all information through our websites, including any information collected from young children. Mall of America will respond on behalf of itself and its service provider, West Edmonton Mall, to any inquiries from parents and guardians regarding our websites’ Privacy Policy.

### Kinds of Information Collected and How Information Is Collected

In general, Mall of America limits information about young children to non-personally identifiable information. We will never ask for certain types of information from a young child, including address and telephone number. Occasionally, however, for purposes of sweepstakes, contests or special events or activities, we will collect personally identifiable information such as the child’s name, email address, birthday, hobbies or favorite cartoon characters.

Generally, we do not gather personal information from users that we know to be young children. If we seek to collect information about a young child, we will attempt to gather that information from the parent or guardian. For example, we may ask for the first name of the child, the parent or guardian’s email address, the child’s birthday. In the case of special events or activities that require a young child’s participation online, such as game play, reward centers or the like, we may ask the child for a limited amount of personal information, such as an email address and user name. In that case, we will collect only as much personal information as is required for the event or activity. If we seek to collect personal information from a young child, we will first provide parental notice and/or obtain verifiable parental consent. The specific process may vary depending on the intended use of the information, and may involve an email notice to the parent or guardian with an opportunity for the parent to opt-out their child, or a prior opt-in consent obtained from the parent and verified by receipt of an email from the parent, verification of a credit card number, or otherwise as permitted by law. We collect and retain only such personal information from young children as we feel is reasonably necessary to allow the child to participate in the sweepstakes, contest, event or activity.

### How Information Is Used

Mall of America uses information collected from young children in order to allow the child to participate in online game play or other activities, and to notify the child’s parent or guardian that the child has entered a sweepstakes or contest or has won a prize. We send a confirming email to parents or guardians to notify them that their child has registered for a sweepstakes or contest. This email will be sent within 48 hours of when the child registers with us. If we do not receive a request to remove by parents or guardians, we assume that the child’s participation is acceptable to parents or guardians. We will assume that future sweepstakes or contests are also acceptable.

Parents and guardians have the option to agree to the collection and use of their child’s information without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties. Mall of America does not give, sell, lend or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information about young children to any third parties without a parent or guardian’s verifiable consent. NOTE that our service provider (West Edmonton Mall) may have access to the information in connection with its performance of services for operation of the website, but they are not authorized to use or disclose any such personal information.

Parents or guardians are encouraged to contact us to review, change or delete information about their children, or to opt-out of any further collection or use of their child’s information, via the contact information set out at the beginning of this Children’s Privacy Notice.

### Revisions to Children’s Privacy Notice

Please note that this Children’s Privacy Notice may be revised from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this privacy notice without your explicit consent, and we expect that most revisions will be minor. Each version of this Children’s Privacy Notice will be identified the bottom of the Privacy Policy by its effective date, and we will keep prior versions of this Children’s Privacy Notice in an archive for your review.

### California Privacy Rights

Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California residents have the right to request certain information from a business with respect to personal information that a business shares with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Additionally, California residents with an established business relationship with Mall of America may choose to opt-out of Mall of America disclosing personal information about them to third parties for marketing purposes. As previously stated, we do not disclose personal information about our users to third parties for marketing purposes.
