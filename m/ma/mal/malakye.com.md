# Privacy Policy

 Privacy Policy

1\. What information we collect

1.1. Data Controllers

If you reside in the United States, then the personal information provided to or gathered by Malakye is controlled by Broadsan Technologies, Inc. DBA Malakye.com, 1721 Artesia Blvd. #E Manhattan Beach, CA. 90266.  If you have any concern about providing information to us or having such information displayed on the Malakye services or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement (together also referred to as Malakye’s Terms of Service), you should not become a Member of Malakye, visit our websites, apps or otherwise use our Services.

We collect your personal information in the following ways:

1.2. Registration

When you create an account with us, you provide us with information (including your name, email address, and password) that we use to offer you a personalized, relevant experience on Malakye.

To create an account on Malakye, you must provide us with at least your name, email address and/or mobile number, and a password. You can choose to provide further information about yourself during the registration process (for example, your gender and location). We use this information to provide you with more customized services like language-specific profile pages, updates, and content, more relevant ads, and more valuable career opportunities, and it may appear on your Malakye profile that is viewable by others. You understand that, by creating an account, Malakye and others will be able to identify you by your Malakye profile, and you allow Malakye to use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our User Agreement. We may also ask for your credit card details if you purchase certain Malakye services.

We also provide the option to register for a SlideShare account, for which you must provide at least your name, email address and/or mobile number, and a password. We no longer provide the option to register for a separate Pulse account, but you may continue to use your existing Pulse account if you already have one, as described here.

1.3. Profile Information

You can add professional details – like your job title, education, and skills – to your profile. A complete profile helps you be found by other people for opportunities. It also means we can show you relevant ads and content.

After you create an account (other than the distinct SlideShare and Pulse accounts), you may choose to provide additional information on your Malakye profile, such as descriptions of your skills, professional experience, and educational background. You can list honors, awards, professional affiliations, Malakye Group memberships, networking objectives, companies or individuals that you follow, and other information including content. With your approval, your connections may provide recommendations and endorsements of you. Providing additional information enables you to derive more benefit from Malakye by helping you express your professional identity; find other professionals, opportunities, and information; and help recruiters and business opportunities find you. It also enables us to serve you ads and other relevant content on and off Malakye.

1.4. Customer Service

When you contact our customer support services  we collect information that helps us categorize your question, respond to it, and, if applicable, investigate any breach of our User Agreement or this Privacy Policy. We also use this information to track potential problems and trends and customize our support responses to better serve you.

1.5. Using the Malakye Sites and Applications

We collect information when you use (whether as a Member or a Visitor) the Malakye websites applications Malakye platform technology or other Services. For example, we collect information when you view or click on ads, import your address book, join and participate in groups, participate in polls, install a Malakye mobile application and share articles on Malakye. If you are logged in on Malakye.com or a Malakye cookie on your device identifies you, your usage information and the log data described in Section 1.10 of this policy, such as your IP address, will be associated with your account. Even if you’re not logged into a Service, we log information about devices used to access our Services, including IP address.

1.6. Using Third-Party Services and Visiting Third-Party Sites

We receive information when you use your Malakye account to log in to a third-party website or application. Also, when you visit a third-party site that embeds Malakye professional we receive information that those pages have loaded in your web browser. If you are logged in as a Member when you visit sites with Malakye plugins, we use this information to recommend tailored content to you. Malakye will use this information to personalize the Malakye-provided functionality on third-party sites, including providing you insights from your Malakye network. Malakye’s retention of this data is addressed in Section 3.2. We do not use this information for advertising. Malakye may provide reports containing aggregated impression information to companies hosting Malakye plugins and similar technologies to help them measure Malakye-generated traffic to their websites.

1.7. Cookies

We use cookies and similar technologies, including mobile application identifiers, to help us recognize you across different Services, improve your Malakye experience, increase security, measure use and effectiveness of our Services, and serve advertising. You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools. For more information, including the types of cookies found on Malakye, please read Malakye’s Cookie Policy. By visiting Malakye, you consent to the placement of cookies and beacons in your browser and HTML-based emails in accordance with this Privacy Policy and Malakye’s Cookie Policy.

1.8. Advertising Technologies and Web Beacons

We target ads to you on and off Malakye, based on information you included in your profile and your use of Malakye. We give you a number of ways to opt out of these ads, including through the Ad Choices icon shown with any Malakye ads on third-party sites. If you do not want to receive Malakye ads on third-party sites, you can opt out.

We target ads to Members and Visitors both on and off Malakye through a variety of ad networks and ad exchanges, using:

    Advertising technologies like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers as permitted by mobile platforms both on and off Malakye;

    Member-provided profile information and categories (for example, “product managers in Texas”);

    Information inferred from a Member’s profile (for example, using job titles to infer age, industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; or names to infer gender);

    Your use of Malakye or clicking on a Malakye ad;

    Information from advertising partners which we use to help deliver ads more relevant to you.

We do not share personally identifiable information with any third-party advertiser or ad network, although your profile is visible to other Members and through public search depending on your settings.

Malakye may show you sponsored content in your Network Update Stream (NUS), which will be designated as sponsored content and will behave like other NUS updates. If you take social action (for example, if you “like or “comment” on the sponsored content), your action will be seen by your network and other Members who are shown the sponsored content after you have acted on it. Please note that all social actions on SlideShare (e.g. liking certain content, following or being followed by others) are public, unless expressly specified otherwise with respect to premium accounts.

Malakye ads that are delivered on third-party sites contain the label “Ads by Malakye.” You may opt out of (i) these ads served to you on third-party sites and/or (ii) us using information from advertising partners to target ads by going here. The Ad Choices icon shows you that we adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising. Please see http://www.aboutads.info for details.

If you wish to not receive targeted ads from most third party companies, you may opt-out by, as applicable, clicking on the AdChoice icon or “Ads by Malakye” link in or next to the ad or by visiting http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/ and http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads or targeted ads by companies not listed with these opt-out tools.

1.9. Log Files, IP Addresses, and Information About Your Computer and Mobile Device

When you visit or leave Malakye sites or apps (whether as a Member or Visitor) by clicking a hyperlink or when you view a plugin on a third-party site, we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came or the one to which you are directed. Also, advertisers receive the URL of the page that you are on when you click an ad on Malakye. We also receive the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer or the proxy server that you use to access the web, your computer operating system details, your type of web browser, your mobile device (including your mobile device identifier provided by your mobile device operating system), your mobile operating system (if you are accessing Malakye using a mobile device), and the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We may also receive location data passed to us from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have set up, which we use to show you local information (for example, Pulse articles about your area) on our mobile applications. Most mobile devices allow you to prevent real time location data being sent to Malakye, and of course Malakye will honor your settings.

In the case of our Android apps, you will be provided notice of the types of data (e.g. location) that will be sent to us. If you choose to use our app after this notice, we process this data to enable registration or preview product features for you (e.g. jobs near you). If you choose not to become a Member, we will delete this information.

1.10. Other

Malakye is a dynamic, innovative environment, which means we are always seeking to improve the services we offer you. We often introduce new features, some of which may result in the collection of new information (for example, when the Endorsements feature launched, we began collecting information about skills for which Members were endorsed and the individuals who endorsed them). Furthermore, new partnerships or corporate acquisitions may result in new features, and we may potentially collect new types of information.

2\. How we use your personal information

2.1. Consent to Malakye Processing Information About You

The personal information you provide to us may reveal or allow others to identify aspects of your life that are not expressly stated on your profile (for example, your picture or your name may reveal your gender). By providing personal information to us when you create or update your account and profile, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of Malakye’s User Agreement and freely accepting and agreeing to our processing of your personal information in ways set out by this Privacy Policy. Supplying to us any information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw or modify your consent to Malakye’s collection and processing of the information you provide at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, by changing your account settings or your profile on Malakye

2.2. Malakye Communications

We communicate with you through email, notices posted on the Malakye websites or apps, messages to your Malakye inbox, and other means available through the Services, including mobile text messages and push notifications. Examples of these communications include: (1) welcome and engagement communications - informing you about how to best use Malakye, new features, updates about other Members you are connected to and their actions, etc.; (2) service communications; these will cover service availability, security, and other issues about the functioning of Malakye; (3) promotional communications; these include messages, and may contain promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners, including job opportunities and information from companies that are hiring. These messages will be sent to you based on your profile information and messaging preferences. You can also opt out of promotional messages by sending a request to Malakye Help Center. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from Malakye.

2.3. User Communications

Many communications that you initiate through Malakye will list your name and primary email address in the header of the message. Messages you initiate may also provide the recipient with aggregate information about your network. Other communications that you initiate through the Services, like a request for an introduction, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal email address contact information. Once you have connected with an individual, regardless of who sent the invitation, your contact information will be shared with that individual.

2.4. Customized Content

We use information that you provide to us to customize your experience and the experiences of others on Malakye. For example, when you sign in to your account, we may display the names of new Members who have recently joined your network or recent updates from your connections and companies you follow. We also use aggregated information from your network and other users to show you content, such as news and presentations relevant to you, your industry, or your profession.

2.5. Sharing Information with Affiliates

We may share your personal information with our Malakye affiliates (meaning entities controlled by, controlling or under common control with Malakye) outside of the Malakye entity that is your data controller as necessary to provide the Services. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are consenting to this sharing.

2.6. Sharing Information with Third Parties

Any information you put on your profile and any content you post on Malakye may be seen by others. We don’t provide any of your non-public information (like your email address) to third parties without your consent, unless required by law, or as described in Sections 2.6 and 2.14 of this Policy. Other people may find your Malakye profile information through search engines (you can choose which parts of your public profile are accessible to public search engines in your settings), or use services like Twitter in conjunction with your Malakye account.

Malakye offers a “public profile” feature that allows Members to publish portions of their Malakye profile to the public Internet. This public profile will be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for your name. You may choose the parts of your profile that search engines index or completely opt out of this feature in your Malakye account settings. However, third-party search engines may not automatically update their caches, which may contain old public profile information.

We do not rent or sell personal information that you have not posted on Malakye, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We will not disclose personal information that is not published to your profile or generated through engagement with other Malakye services, such as Groups and Company Pages, without your consent or to carry out your instructions (for example, to process payment information) unless Malakye has a good faith belief that disclosure is permitted by law or is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Privacy Policy or our User Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to Member service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or safety of Malakye, our Members, Visitors, or the public. See Section 2.14 for additional details about Malakye’s compliance with legal requests for information.

Malakye supports middleware providers that offer archiving solutions to firms subject to financial services regulation, which, with your permission, facilitate the archiving of your communications and other Malakye activity by a third party for compliance purposes. Content distributed through Malakye’s sharing features and third-party integrations may result in displaying some of your personal information outside of Malakye. For example, when you post content to a Malakye Group that is open for public discussion, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in search engine results.

Third parties (for example, your email provider) may give you the option to upload certain information in your Malakye contacts onto their own service. If you choose to share your Malakye contacts, you will be granting your third party provider the right to store, access, disclose and use your Malakye contacts in the ways described in such third party's terms and privacy policy.

2.7. Polls and Surveys

Polls and Surveys may be conducted by Malakye, Members, or third parties. Some third parties may target advertisements to you on the results page based on your answers in the poll. Malakye or third parties may follow up with you regarding your participation. We may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in surveys or polls. If the delivery of incentives requires your contact information, you may be asked to provide personal information to the third party fulfilling the incentive offer, which will be used only for the purpose of delivering incentives and verifying your contact information. It is up to you whether you provide this information, or whether you desire to take advantage of an incentive. Your consent to use any personally identifiable information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it. You may opt out of participating in surveys by changing your settings to stop receiving these inquiries and requests.

2.9. Search

You can search for Members, employment opportunities, information about companies, and community content. We use personal information from Malakye, including Member profiles, Groups content, and Company Pages, to inform and refine our search service.

2.10. Testimonials and Advertisements Placed through Malakye Ads

If you provide any testimonials about our goods or services or place advertisements through the Malakye Ads, we may post those testimonials and examples of advertisements you place in connection with our promotion of these services to third parties. Testimonials and advertisements may include your name and other personal information that you have provided. For more information about Malakye Ads, please see the Malakye Ads Terms of Use.

2.11. Compliance with Legal Process and Other Disclosures

It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information, profile information, or information about your activities as a Member or Visitor when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if Malakye has a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce the User Agreement, investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, or protect the security or integrity of our Service; or (3) exercise or protect the rights, property, or safety of Malakye, our Members, personnel, or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. In light of our principles, we may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but do not commit to challenge every demand. To find out more about how Malakye engages with government requests for data see our Law Enforcement Data Request Guidelines.

2.12. Disclosures to Others as the Result of a Change in Control or Sale of Malakye Corporation

We may also disclose your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of the assets of Malakye Corporation, a subsidiary, or division, or as the result of a change in control of the company or one of its affiliates, or in preparation for any of these events. Any third party to which Malakye transfers or sells Malakye’s assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.

2.16. Service Providers

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services (e.g. maintenance, analysis, audit, marketing and development). These third parties have limited access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated to Malakye not to disclose or use it for other purposes.

3\. Your Choices & Obligations

3.1. Rights to Access, Correct, or Delete Your Information, and Closing Your Account

You have a right to (1) access, modify, correct, or delete your personal information controlled by Malakye regarding your profile, (2) change or remove your content, and (3) close your account.

We generally delete closed account information and will de-personalize any logs or other backup information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.

3.2. Data Retention

We retain the personal information you provide while your account is in existence or as needed to provide you services. Malakye may retain your personal information even after you have closed your account if retention is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes between Members, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce this Privacy Policy and our User Agreement. We may retain personal information, for a limited period of time, if requested by law enforcement. Malakye's Customer Service may retain information for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only, but we generally delete or de-personalize closed account data consistent with Section 3.1., except in the case of our plugin impression data, which we will try to de-personalize at the time of collection, but in any event, we will de-personalize within 7 days.

    You must keep your username and password confidential and not share it with others.

        Any violation of these guidelines or those detailed in our User Agreement or elsewhere may lead to the restriction, suspension, or termination of your account at the sole discretion of Malakye.

4.2. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes in the way we treat your personal information, or to the Privacy Policy, we will provide notice to you on the Services or by some other means, such as email. Please review the changes carefully. If you agree to the changes, simply continue to use our Services. If you object to any of the changes to our terms and you no longer wish to use Malakye, you may close your account(s). Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that Malakye has about you and your account. Using Malakye after a notice of changes has been communicated to you or published on our Services shall constitute consent to the changed terms or practices.

4.3. California's Shine the Light Law

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. Under Section 1798.83, Malakye currently does not share any personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

4.5. Security

We have implemented security safeguards designed to protect the personal information that you provide in accordance with industry standards. Access to your data on Malakye is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as credit card information) is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the Malakye Services. We also offer secure https access to the the Malakye.com website. To protect any data you store on our servers, we also regularly monitor our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use a tier-one secured-access data center. However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to Malakye. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that emails, instant messaging, and similar means of communication with other Members are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means. Please help keep your account safe by using a strong password.
