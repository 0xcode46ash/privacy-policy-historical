#### 3\. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not share or sell your personal information to third parties for their promotional purposes.

Information Sharing with Mashery-Powered Portals. One of the benefits of registering with Mashery is the access that you receive to a wide range of Portals powered by Mashery. In each instance that you request access to a Mashery-powered Portal that is administered by a business other than Mashery, you agree that Mashery may share your Mashery account information with such business. Please be aware that a different privacy policy may apply to your use of such Mashery-powered Portal. We encourage you to look for and review the privacy statements of each and every Mashery-powered Portal that you visit.

Information Sharing with API Partners. If you register as a developer on one of our API partner pages, your information will be collected both by Mashery and the API partner. Mashery may provide certain information provided by you to the API Partner and the API Partner may provide certain information provided by you to Mashery. Mashery recommends that you read the privacy policy of every API Partner during registration.

Information Sharing with Service Providers. We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as submitting emails to you on our behalf or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

Other Disclosure to Third Parties. Except as stated elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Mashery will not disclose your personally-identifiable information to any third party other than: (i) at your request or (ii) to private entities and law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate (a) to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, (b) to protect our own business and assets, or (c) in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others. If we disclose your personally-identifiable information to third parties, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to require that the recipients of such information apply the terms of this Privacy Policy to that information as if they were Mashery.

Business Transfer. If Mashery is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a significant portion of its assets, a notification will be posted on the website of any resultant change in ownership or uses of personal information.

We reserve the right to send you certain account and legal communications relating to the applicable Mashery service, such as service announcements and administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.

#### 9\. LINKS TO OTHER INTERNET SITES

The Website may allow links to various other Internet sites. Mashery assumes no responsibility for the information practices of such other Internet sites you are able to access through the Website.

The Website may feature message boards, blogs, and/or other public forums where users can share information or where users can post questions.

Some of these tools do not retain information, while others may store information in accordance with the authorization you provide at the time you use the service or tool. Any message board, online forum, or similar interactive service is by design open to the public and is not a private, secure service, and Mashery is not responsible for the privacy of information voluntarily provided by a user in interactive areas. You should think carefully before disclosing any personally identifiable information in any public forum because what you have written may be seen, disclosed to, or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for purposes unauthorized by you.

#### 11\. SECURITY

The importance of security for all personally-identifiable information associated with visitors to the Website is of utmost concern to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, Mashery cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information to us at your own risk. Once we receive your personally-identifiable information, we will take reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems.

#### 12\. YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS

By using the Website, you signify your assent to the Mashery Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use the Website. Your continued use of the Website following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. Mashery will, however, use personally-identifiable information only in accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected. If we make any material changes we will notify you by means of a notice on this Website prior to the change becoming effective.
