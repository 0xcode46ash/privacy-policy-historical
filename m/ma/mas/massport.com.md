# Massport - Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes how the websites maintained by the Massachusetts Port Authority collect and utilize information supplied by our visitors. This policy may change from time to time as may be appropriate. You can visit and enjoy our Websites without disclosing any personal identifying information about yourself. However, we offer some special services such as FlightTracker, site Subscription via E-mail, Construction Updates via E-mail, and online Form and Publication Requests. In order for these services to work properly, we must collect some basic information from you. If you submit any personal identifying information to us, you can be assured that we will not sell, lease or share this information with anyone else without your permission, except as follows: (1) as may be required by the Massachusetts General Laws, including the Public Records Law (M.G.L. Chapter 66, Section 10); (2) in the course of a law enforcement investigation; or (3) in the event of a suspected attempt to gain unauthorized access or to do physical damage (an attack by hackers, for example). 

**Web Server Activity Logs -** Like most web servers on the Internet, our servers collect and store all of the information that your web browser sends when it requests a web page including:

It is impossible to determine the actual identity of an individual user from this information. 

We develop summary reports, or logs, from the information collected. These logs are analyzed periodically in order to study site usage over time and to perform studies in order to improve the site's organization, performance and usefulness. The raw data used to develop these logs are erased periodically as a part of routine system maintenance. 

**Electronic Mail -** When you send us personal identifying information via E-mail (that is, in a message, question or comment or by filling out a form that e-mails us this information), we use it to respond to your request. We may forward your E-mail to other Massachusetts Port Authority employees or contract personnel who are better able to answer your question. The E-mail itself may be retained as required by Massachusetts Laws and regulations governing the retention of public records. 

**Cookies -** Massachusetts Port Authority places a cookie, a small text file, on a visitor's hard drive. This cookie contains a randomly generated user ID in order to track unique site visits. Massachusetts Port Authority does not use cookies to store any personal information. This cookie can only be read by Massachusetts Port Authority servers and assists us with the statistical analysis necessary to assure site functionality and responsiveness. 

**Opt Out Procedures -** If you have enrolled in any of our special services and wish to be removed from our mailing list, please complete the following [form](http://www.massport.com/sitemap/contact.asp) and indicate which list you would like to unsubscribe from in the comment field.
