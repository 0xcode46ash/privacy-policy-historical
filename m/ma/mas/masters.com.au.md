# Privacy Policy | Masters Home Improvement

**Respecting your privacy**

Masters is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals’ personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988(Cth).

Our respect for our customers' right to privacy of their personal information is paramount. We have policies and procedures to ensure that all personal information, no matter how or where it is obtained, is handled sensitively, securely, and in accordance with the National Privacy Principles.

This Privacy Policy documents how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise handle personal information.

 **What personal information do we collect?**

We may ask you for your personal information so that we can provide you with products and services but we will only collect such personal information if it is necessary for one of our functions or activities. Privacy law requires us to collect personal information about you only from you if it is reasonable and practical to do so.

Some examples of situations where personal information is collected from you by Masters:

If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.

At or before the time the personal information is collected by us, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of who we are, the fact that you are able to gain access to the information held about you, the purpose of the collection, the type(s) of organisations to which we usually disclose the information collected about you, any laws requiring the collection of the information and the main consequences for you if all or part of the information is not collected.

Generally, you have no obligation to provide any information requested by us. If you choose to withhold requested information however, we may not be able to provide you with the goods and services that depend on the collection of that information, particularly if the collection of that information is required by law.

 **How do we protect your personal information?**

Woolworths takes measures to ensure your personal information is protected from unauthorised access, loss, misuse, disclosure or alteration. We also take measures to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information when it is no longer required. The types of measures we take vary with the type of information, and how it is collected and stored.

We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) authentication and external payment gateways for all orders placed to ensure the security of your personal card details.  Your credit card details are not stored, processed or transmitted through or via the Masters website; all financial details are processed via Datacash or Paypal, our secure payment providers.

 **How is personal information used?**

The personal information that we ask for is generally used to provide products or services to you.

We may also use your personal information in other ways to provide you with superior service. This may include using your personal information to advise you of new products and services or seek your feedback. You have the right to tell us that you do not want us to send information to you other than for the main purpose for which we have collected your personal details.

We do not rent or sell your personal information under any circumstances.

Where possible, we take contractual measures to ensure our service providers comply with the privacy principles and where relevant, other standard imposed by us.

We may transfer your personal information to third parties within or outside Australia.  We will only do this for the purpose of and incidental to providing our products and services to you in a secure way.  This includes uses and disclosures which we require to operate this site and  for other purposes to which you consent to (either express or inferred consent).

Our web site may contain links to other web sites and those third party web sites may collect personal information about you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other businesses or the content of web sites that are linked to our web site.

 **Access to your personal information**

We will provide you with access to any of your personal information we hold (except in the limited circumstances recognised by privacy law).

If you wish to access your personal information please write to us at Privacy Officer, Woolworths Limited, 1 Woolworths Way,  Bella Vista NSW 2153 or email us at [privacy@woolworths.com.au](http://privacy@woolworths.com.au/). Of course, before we provide you with access to your personal information we will require some proof of identity. For most requests, your information will be provided free of charge, however we may charge a reasonable fee if your request requires a substantial effort on our part.

If you need to update your information (eg. if you change your address), please contact Masters directly so that we can make the change.

 **Amendments to policy**

We may amend this policy from time to time to ensure that it remains accurate in view of any alterations to our information handling practices due to new technologies and changed business practices. Any update policy will be published on our website.
