  | 

Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s Web browser on the user’s hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user’s transactions on related Web pages.

"I personally guarantee MRR"

Every time I login to the members area - " **What's the surprise MRR will bring today?** "  Wow! New products added everyday - and in some cases practically within minutes! :-)

As a member of MRR, I get the latest and greatest MRR and PLR products that are available.  I personally guarantee MRR.  And the price is just perfect.  I can see where all the other memberships get their stuff!  I found their secret source.

Thank you MRR - yOu rOck!
