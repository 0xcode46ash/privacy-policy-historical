**MASN Online Privacy Policy**

MASN is committed to protecting the personal information that you provide to us when using the MASN Site. This privacy policy describes how we treat all user data collected during your visit to [www.MASNsports.com](http://www.masnsports.com/), both anonymous data and personally-identifying data.

**User Data We Collect**

We collect two types of user data: (1) anonymous data that is automatically collected from all visitors to the MASN Site; and (2) personally-identifiable data that you voluntarily submit to us (described below under "Personal Data"). 

__Anonymous Data__  
We automatically collect Internet Protocol addresses and domain names through our server. We also track the number and frequency of hits per page on an aggregate basis. 

__Personal Data__  
We may collect Personal Data that you voluntarily provide, such as your name and postal address, phone number, e-mail address, and similar information, when you participate in certain activities on the MASN Site, including (but not limited to) when you sign up for email updates.

**How We Use the Data We Collect**

We use anonymous data to identify the source of user traffic (for example, georgetown.edu or aol.com), but we are not able to use this data to identify individual users. We use data on which sections of the MASN Site are most visited, so that we can evaluate the popularity of our different Web pages and continue to improve the MASN Site. We do not link any anonymous data with the Personal Data you provide to us.

We use your Personal Data for various purposes, including: to fulfill the request for which you specifically provided the data; to send you e-mail newsletters or action alerts, if you have not opted out of receiving that information.

**Third-Party Sharing**

We will not share your Personal Data with any third party unless we first notify you and offer you an appropriate choice to consent to such further use, for example, through an opt-out or opt-in request. 

**Your Ability to Choose**

When you provide us with your Personal Data on the MASN Site, you can let us know that you do not wish to receive our online newsletter or any e-mailed action alerts by un-checking the subscription request boxes on the form you are completing, by contacting us via email at [info@masnstudios.com](mailto:info@masn.tv). 

**Children**

We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. 

**Security**

The Personal Data we collect about you is stored on a secure, password protected server. We use industry-standard encryption technologies with respect to the receipt and transfer of Personal Data you submit to us on the MASN Site and only authorized personnel have access to your information. Nevertheless, despite our best efforts, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 

**Updating Your Data**

To update your Personal Data or to make corrections, you can do so by sending us the update via email to [info@masnstudios.com](mailto:info@masn.tv). 

**Comments and Questions**

If you have any questions, comments or concerns about this Online Privacy Policy or our data collection practices or to request that we delete your Personal Data, you can contact us via email at [info@masnstudios.com](mailto:info@masn.tv).
