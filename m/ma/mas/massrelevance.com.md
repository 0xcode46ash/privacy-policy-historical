This Privacy Notice describes how Lithium collects, uses, shares and secures your personally identifying information on this Site, and as a data processor on behalf of our customers through the Services we provide to them. The use of information collected through our Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Service for which the customer has engaged Lithium, as agreed in a signed contract between Lithium and customer. This Privacy Notice also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of your personally identifying information by Lithium and options available to you to access your information and request correction or deletion should you choose to do so.

Lithium does not send unsolicited emails or sell any personally identifying information users may have submitted to us though our website. In addition, for lead generation or marketing purposes, we may ask individuals interested in obtaining more information about Lithium products to voluntarily submit their contact information to us.

This Recruiting Data includes anything that an individual chooses to include a resume or application, and typically consists of job history, education, personal interests and activities, name, email address, phone number, and residence address. Further, Lithium collects gender, race, and military status from employment candidates to assist Lithium in its equal employment opportunity compliance and related statistical tracking to help our diversity efforts.

##  Information Collected from Other Social Media Sites

This data includes names, user IDs, social media handles, gender, and other information that individuals choose to make publicly available on social media sites. Lithium also monitors the public activities of individuals on social media sites, including posts, blogs, tweets, and profile information, including such social media messages directed at our customers (the “brands” that are interested in understanding their consumer customers in order to serve them better).

Additionally, when a customer provides or accesses information through one of our Services, we may receive information from the customer’s input of,in response to, or by way of interaction with, content generated by customer’s use of the Services, such as social media messaging, as well as from the customer’s website or Third Party Site. This may include information regarding a third party that was published on or provided to the customer’s website or Third Party Sites.

This Privacy Notice does not govern the collection of content by Third Party Sites that is not published or generated through the Services, except to the extent that we act as a processor with respect to such content.  Our customers are required to abide by the applicable policies and requirements of such Third Party Sites used in connection with the Services and when using information from Third Party Sites

##  Information Collected through Community Forums

We collect information that is posted by users to the Lithium Community forum (also called the “Lithosphere”) located at the Site, including content that is processed and stored within such community (“Community Content”). As part of our Services, we collect information that users post to our customer’s online communities hosted by Lithium (“Customer Communities”).

##  Information Collected from Customers

We collect information that our customers provide us to enable them to log on and use the Services. This data consists of personally identifiable information of their authorized users, company information and configuration, content, internal communications and notes.

##  Information Collected from Other Websites

We also collect information from partners and other websites concerning visitors of our website and our customers‘ websites (“Visitors”). For example, we ask or engage third parties to tell us additional information about Visitors, such as how they responded to our communication or promotions. We analyze this data, which we use for legitimate business purposes

##  Use of Information Obtained by Lithium

##  Information Users Submit to Lithium

Information collected by Lithium from each Customer Community is used solely to provide the Services for that Community, to provide related Services to the customer who manages that Community, and as otherwise agreed in a contract between Lithium and the customer. Other information gathered is solely used to: (i) respond to a user's request for additional information on Lithium Services; (ii) provide, develop, enhance and support related Lithium Services; (iii) fulfill Lithium’s legal obligations and defend Lithium’s legal rights, as needed. We may also use a user's email address to send promotional or marketing materials on related Services, such as updates on the product line, but this is only after the user is a customer, a Service is requested by the user, or Lithium has some other pre-existing business relationship with the user. We use your IP address and browser-type information in the general administration of our website.

In addition, we use the information that we gather from other social media sites to:

  * provide context to a brand, such as information about an individual’s past interactions with that brand, and the individual’s public profile information, to improve the quality of the brand’s interactions with that consumer who is reaching out to them over social media,
  * assess each individual’s general topics of interest (but excluding sensitive topics such as political or religious views),
  * measure their influence on social media by assigning a numerical value based on our proprietary algorithm which looks at frequency/ dates of activity, responses of other individuals to that activity, and the occurrence of certain key words and/or brand names, and,
  * allow brands to compare themselves to other brands in their industry by seeing aggregated statistics of the numbers of individuals who promote or detract from each brand based on the individuals’ public social media activity



Through our social media management services, we provide this information on individuals to the customer support and service representatives of the companies who are Lithium customers, the “brands”, so that those representatives can provide support and service to their consumer customers more effectively, by triaging communications to address more urgent requests in priority order, and by understanding the interests of their consumer customers to provide more targeted support. We also provide aggregated statistic to the brands for competitive analysis purposes.

Through our Lithium Community and Lithium JX Community platforms, we make social impact scores available for individuals who participate in the community to create more effective and interesting social interactions within the Community.

In the collection and use of information from other social media sites, we rely on our legitimate interests in providing services to our customers, and assisting them to provide better service to their customers, under applicable data privacy regulations, and balance those interests with the data privacy concerns of individuals. If you would like more information about our legitimate interests analysis, or have concerns that you would like us to address, please contact [privacy@lithium.com](mailto:privacy@lithium.com).

In regards to Lithium Services, Lithium collects information under the direction of its customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. If you are a customer of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our service, please contact the customer that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.

In regards to candidates for employment, we use your Recruiting Data for purposes of evaluating candidates for potential employment with Lithium. We disclose your Recruiting Data to our private equity sponsor, Vista Equity Partners, and its affiliates, including Vista Consulting Group (collectively, " **Vista** ”), for administration, research, database development and business operation purposes, in line with the terms of this Privacy Notice. Vista processes your personal information on the basis of its legitimate interests in overseeing the recruitment process and, if applicable, your employment relationship with Lithium. If you have consented to us doing so, we also share your personal information with other Vista portfolio companies for the purpose of being considered for other job opportunities in the pooling system, both inside and outside your home country (including inside and outside the EEA). Please find a full list of all Vista portfolio companies at: <https://www.vistaequitypartners.com/companies/>. For residents of EEA countries, when this requires us to transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, we comply with applicable EU data privacy rules.

Information collected by Lithium from customers is used solely to provide the Services and as otherwise agreed to in a contract between Lithium and the customer.

###  Aggregated Data

Lithium may use and disclose data cleansed of all personal data so that it no longer can identify the customer and/or User; and aggregated with similar data from other Lithium customers (“Aggregated Data”) to determine and report Services usage patterns by customers and end users generally, and for any other legitimate purpose.

##  Point of Collection Purposes

Sometimes, our customers have specific purposes for which they plan to use an individual user’s information, and our customers describe those purposes at the point of collection.  For example, a customer may solicit a user’s feedback in order to improve services and products, respond to a user’s questions or comments, register in connection with a contest, giveaway, or drawing, respond to a request for a brochure, or to otherwise send information to the user.  We may be asked to fulfill or assist with the fulfillment of the requirements associated with the point of collection purposes, but the responsibility to obtain any necessary consents remains with our customers as the data controllers.

##  US-EU Privacy Shield, US-Swiss Privacy Shield, & EC Standard Contractual Clauses

In the course of performing its Services, Lithium and its subprocessors may access and/or transfer personal data to (or from) areas outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), pursuant to either, at Lithium’s sole option: (i) the European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses (“Clauses”) or (ii) the EU-US Privacy Shield program and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield program (collectively “Privacy Shield”).

The following Lithium products are Privacy Shield certified, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland: Conversations, Intelligence, Experiences, and Vault (collectively, the “Privacy Shield Certified Products”).  For the Privacy Shield Certified Products, we have certified that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.  If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Notice and the Privacy Shield principles, the Privacy Shield principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield programs, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

For the Privacy Shield Certified Products, we will adhere to the requirements of the Privacy Shield with respect to personal information (as defined below). As a condition to using the Services, customers are required to obtain all necessary individual consents in order to collect and use personal information.

For purposes of this Privacy Shield disclosure, “personal information” means data that is (a) transferred from the European Union or Switzerland, as the case may be, to the United States; (b) recorded in any form; and (c) about, or pertains to, a specific individual who is identified in, or is identifiable from, the data.  “Sensitive information” means personal information specifying medical or health conditions, personal sexuality, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, ideological, philosophical, or trade union-related beliefs, views or activities, trade union membership, information specifying the sex life of the individual, information on social security measures, or administrative or criminal proceedings and sanctions, which are treated outside pending proceedings.  Sensitive information also includes personal information received from a third party where the third party treats and identifies it as sensitive.

Lithium strictly prohibits the entry of Sensitive Information into Lithium systems, except with the express prior written consent of Lithium in each instance.

If Lithium relies on Privacy Shield as a basis for transfer of personal data outside of the EEA and if Privacy Shield is deemed invalid by a competent authority or otherwise superseded, then any such transfers of EEA personal data outside the EEA shall be conducted pursuant to the EC Standard Contractual Clauses (the “Clauses”) and Lithium will execute a copy of the Clauses at customer’s request.

##  Enforcement

Lithium is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”). In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the Privacy Shield, Lithium is potentially liable.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield, Lithium commits to resolve complaints about privacy and our collection or use of personal information.  European Union and Switzerland citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Notice should first send us an email to [legal@lithium.com.](mailto:legal@lithium.com)

Lithium has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield principles, to the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (the “ICDR”), an international dispute resolution provider. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit [http://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html](https://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html) for more information and to file a complaint.
