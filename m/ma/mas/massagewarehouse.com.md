# Massage Warehouse Privacy Policy - Privacy Information

Our Privacy Policy describes the information we gather about you, and the purpose for which it is used.

Doesn't it bug you when companies sell your name to other companies? It bugs us! Massage Warehouse, a division of Scrip, Inc will never sell your information to any third party, ever. You have our word.

##### What we collect

  * Identifiable information absolutely necessary for the transaction or our internal records.
  * The domain names and email addresses of visitors to our web page, the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, aggregate information on what pages customers access or visit, and any information customers volunteer.
  * Financial information, such as a credit card number, used for order processing only.
  * Contact information, used to send your order, as well as catalogs, newsletter and other relevant information.



##### What we do with your information

The information we gather is used in-house to help us create a better and more effective shopping experience for our customers. Understanding typical navigational patterns helps us improve website flow and efficiency. Understanding typical purchase patterns helps with inventory control and new product additions.

When you make a purchase, we will send you emails to confirm your order and may also need to contact you via phone, postal mail or email if we have other questions regarding your order.

We may disclose personally identifiable information you provide in response to a particular legal process. For example, in response to a court order, subpoena, or at the behest of a law enforcement agency's request.

We require that direct-to-customer shipments from vendors protect your information according to their stated Privacy Policies or, in the event they do not have a stated Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy. They may not use the personally identifiable information you provide for any purpose other than to fulfill your order.

We truly have our customers' best interests at heart. We constantly research better ways to offer products that improve and enhance your life.

##### Privacy and Security

Massage Warehouse uses several of the latest encryption technologies to keep your personal information safe. Your private ordering information - including your credit card number - is encrypted using several keys for maximum security. Your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system (128 bit SSL encryption), and the numbers are unreadable to anyone trying to access the site remotely. We have implemented the requisite physical, electronic, and managerial processes to prevent unauthorized access, and maintain data security.

##### Updating or Changing Contact Preferences

If you prefer not to receive information from us, please let us know by contacting us via email or phone.

You may contact us at any time to update the information we have about you.

To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
