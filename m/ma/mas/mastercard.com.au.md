We also may obtain information about you from companies that use other MasterCard products or services, institutions that issue MasterCard branded payment devices, publicly available information systems, and commercial information services.

In addition, you may choose to submit information directly to us. You may do so, for example, on our websites, in connection with a MasterCard product or service, when you participate in an offer or promotion or in connection with an actual or potential business or employment relationship with us.

Information We Share

We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information we collect about you, except as described here in or otherwise as we disclose to you at the time the data is collected.

We share information to process electronic transactions and other activities that you request. We may share the personal information we collect with our affiliates, financial institutions that issue payment cards or process electronic payment transactions, entities that assist with payment card fraud prevention, and merchants. For example, in this context we provide financial institutions with information about their cardholders' transactions that MasterCard processes. In addition, we may share personal information with other third parties with the consent of the individual to whom the information pertains or as otherwise directed by your financial institution. 

We also may share the information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf.

These third parties may use personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We strongly suggest you review the third parties' privacy policies if you use the relevant features.

We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, or (ii) when we believe disclosure is necessary to prevent harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.

We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Global Privacy Notice. Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.
