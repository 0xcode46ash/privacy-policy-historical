Privacy Statement

Effective Date: Wednesday, March 5, 2009 

This privacy policy governs the online information collection practices of Augusta National, Inc. ("ANI") ("we" or "us"). It outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using Masters.com (the "Site"), and the ways in which we use and don't use this information. This privacy policy does not apply to information that we may collect offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail).

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING MASTERS.COM. By using Masters.com, you signify your agreement to this privacy policy and our [terms of use](https://web.archive.org/en_US/info/terms/index.html) . If you do not agree to this privacy policy and the terms of use, you may not use Masters.com.

## 1\. CHANGES TO THE POLICY

If we make a material change to the way in which we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will post a notice on this Site. Your use of Masters.com following any such notice will signify and constitute your assent to and acceptance of such revised privacy policy.

## 2\. THE INFORMATION WE GATHER AND HOW WE USE IT

 **A. Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

We may use non-personally identifiable information collected from you and other users to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics. These aggregated statistics may be used to improve the Site and for product development and marketing purposes generally. We also may provide such aggregated information to advertisers and other third parties for certain purposes, but such statistics contain no personally identifiable information and cannot be used to gather such information.

We collect information through technology to make the Site more useful to you and for various purposes related to our business. For instance, when you come to our Site, we collect your IP address. An IP address is associated with the access point through which you enter the Internet, and is typically controlled by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Your IP address alone is not personally identifiable. We may use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which you visit various parts of our Site, and we may combine IP addresses with personally identifiable information.

Our Site also collects information through a variety of technical methods, including, without limitation, cookies and Web beacons. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. Cookies, web beacons and other technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf.

 **B. Personally Identifiable Information**

The personally identifiable information you provide to us when using the Site may be used to provide products and services to you, to enhance your experience at the Site, and, if applicable, to enhance your experience as a subscriber to ANIâ€™s products and services. The types of information that you may provide to us include your name, e-mail address and age.

The ways in which we use your personally identifiable information will be set forth, and consented to by you when you register to use our Site.

We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, "Outside Contractors") to provide specific services and products related to ANI and the Site, including, without limitation, hosting and maintaining the Site, and developing applications for the Site. These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected from you, including your personally identifiable information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your personally identifiable information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for these Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us. We also require that these contractors (i) protect the privacy of your personally identifiable information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than providing us with products or services for which we contracted.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties in connection with a corporate transaction, where all or a portion of our business or assets (including our associated customer lists containing your personal information) are sold or transferred. We may also disclose your personal information if disclosure is required by law or pursuant to judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings.

In addition to the foregoing uses, if you submit, post, email or otherwise send us information, content or materials, including, without limitation, photographs or comments (collectively, "Submissions"), we (and our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users) shall be entitled to unrestricted use of such information in accordance with our [terms of service](https://web.archive.org/en_US/info/terms/index.html). Please [click here](https://web.archive.org/en_US/info/terms/index.html) to read the [terms of service](https://web.archive.org/en_US/info/terms/index.html) . To the extent Submissions contain any personal information, we cannot protect such information as conditional and third parties may collect and use such information.

You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information in an e-mail or other communications with third parties listed on the Site or in other materials, that information, along with any other information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and correlated and used by such third parties and may result in your receiving unsolicited messages from other persons. Such collection, correlation, use and messages are beyond our control.

## 3\. SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS CONCERNING PRIVACY

If in the future, we collect personally identifiable information from children, we will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) including, without limitation, obtaining necessary parental consent.
