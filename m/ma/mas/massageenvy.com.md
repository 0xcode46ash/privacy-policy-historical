_This document was last updated on October 27, 2016.  _

Massage Envy Franchising, LLC ("Massage Envy," "us," "our," or "we") strives to offer the visitors of our web sites including [MassageEnvy.com](http://www.massageenvy.com/) and [MassageEnvyCareers.com](http://www.massageenvycareers.com/) (the "Site") the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience (the “Services”). In this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”), we describe how we collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain about visitors to the Site and Services.

Please note that this Policy applies only to information collected by Massage Envy online and does not apply to information collected or used by Massage Envy, its subsidiaries, or its affiliates through other means, such as in-store locations. Your use of our Site or Services and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this Policy and our Terms and Conditions, including its applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes. Our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.massageenvy.com/terms) are incorporated by reference into this Policy.

### **1\. Information Collection**

We may collect information about you directly from you and from third parties, as well as automatically through your use of our Site or Services.

**Information we collect directly from you:**

When you use our Site or Services, certain areas or features may require you to provide personal information. If you request an appointment at an independently owned and operated Massage Envy franchised location, we collect your name, email address, phone number, and information about your desired appointment (e.g., your desired date, time and services). If you make a purchase through the Services, we will collect your payment information, including your phone number and billing and shipping information. We also collect information from you when you contact us, such as if you request information about a Massage Envy Franchise. When you contact us, we request your name, contact information, location and information about the purpose for which you are contacting us. We collect information about you, including personally identifiable information, when you make an inquiry or submit an application through the MassageEnvyCareers.com website.

**Information we collect from third parties:**

We also collect information from third parties.  For example, if someone purchases a gift card, we will collect the recipient’s name, email and address information. 

We may also supplement or verify information about you from a service provider.

**Information we collect automatically:**

We may automatically collect the following information about your use of our Site or Services through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies: your domain name; your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your IP address; the length of time you visit our Site and or use our Services; and the referring URL, or the webpage that led you to our Site. We do not link the information we automatically collect to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.  Please see the section “Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms” below for more information.

###  2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information, including your personal information, for the following purposes:

  * To provide our Services to you, to communicate with you about your use of our Services, to respond to your inquiries, to fulfill your orders, and for other customer service purposes.
  * To manage our career website, which is a tool utilized by us and our independently owned and operated Massage Envy franchisees to assist in their recruiting efforts.
  * To tailor the content and information that we may send or display to you, to offer location customization, and personalized help and instructions, and to otherwise personalize your experiences while using the Site or our Services.
  * For marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we may use your information, such as your email address, to send you news and newsletters, special offers, and promotions, or to otherwise contact you about products or information we think may interest you. We also may use the information that we learn about you to assist us in advertising our Services on third party websites.
  * To better understand how users access and use our Site and Services, both on an aggregated and individualized basis, in order to improve our Site and Services and respond to user desires and preferences, and for other research and analytical purposes.
  * To administer our national reciprocity system for the independently owned and operated Massage Envy franchised locations.
  * To protect our own rights and interests, such as to resolve any disputes, enforce our Terms and Conditions, or to respond to legal process.



### 3\. Sharing Information

At Massage Envy, we care about your privacy. We will not share your credit card number or any other financial information with any third party except to complete your transaction and for the verification purposes mentioned above. We may share your personal information with third parties in the following instances:

**Legal Disclaimer:**

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may disclose personal information when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such action is necessary under applicable law. We may disclose personal information in order to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We also share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, to protect our property or interests or that of our agents and employees, and to protect personal safety or the public.

**Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable):**

We share some aggregated demographic information (age, zip codes) with some of our partners. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness.

**Third Party Service Providers:**

We may disclose information about individual users to third parties who provide services to Massage Envy or have a contractual relationship with Massage Envy (e.g., independently owned and operated Massage Envy franchised locations). These third parties provide a variety of services to Massage Envy, including, without limitation, processing and verifying credit card information, tracking Internet marketing campaigns, and processing credit card transactions. In addition, these services may include enhancing the information Massage Envy collects about customers of its franchised locations. We may also use third-party email providers to assist with sending marketing emails for us or on behalf of franchisees. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. Any personally identifiable information that Massage Envy shares with its service providers may only be used to provide services to Massage Envy and/or its franchisees and the service providers will not be given permission to use such information for other purposes.

**Business Transitions:**

In the event Massage Envy goes through a business transition, such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via prominent notice on our website for 30 days after a change of ownership or control of their personal information, if personal information will be used contrary to this policy. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, users will be given the option to continue sharing their information consistent with our notification of changes section. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Massage Envy to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including the Site), for any purposes, without any limitation whatsoever. Massage Envy specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally identifiable information collected from its Site to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information.

###  4. Cookies and other Tracking Mechanisms:

We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site or Services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).

**Cookies:**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Services. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.

  * Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.
  * Persistent Cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.



**Disabling Cookies:**

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.

**Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies:**

Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to customers of our franchised locations, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when e-mails are viewed, and track whether e-mails are forwarded.

**Third Party Analytics:**

 We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site and, to the extent permitted, our Application. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. We do not share your personal information with these third parties.

**Do-Not-Track:**

Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third Party Ad Network section.

**Third Party Ad Networks:**

We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on third party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services offered by us or franchised locations in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.

Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) [Consumer Choice Page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by [DAA companies](http://www.aboutads.info/participating/). You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) [Consumer Opt-Out Page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by [NAI members](http://www.networkadvertising.org/participating-networks).

Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA [Consumer Choice Page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or the NAI [Consumer Opt-Out Page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) or the NAI’s website at [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

### 5\. Communications from the Site and Your Choices

**Transactions and Service Announcements:**

Users who make a purchase will receive a number of emails throughout the transaction process and they may sometimes receive phone calls from our Customer Service department to ensure smooth transactions. We may also occasionally send out service-related announcements, for instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance. Generally, these communications are not promotional in nature, and users will receive them as long as their accounts are open.

**Special Offers, Newsletters and Updates:**

Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications, as explained in the Choice and opt-out section below.

**Choice and opt-out:**

A user can change their opt-in or opt-out status in several ways:

  * From a Newsletter: Click on the "Unsubscribe" link within the email.
  * You may additionally unsubscribe by sending your request to [Privacy@MassageEnvy.com](mailto:Privacy@MassageEnvy.com)
