# Privacy Policy - Mashed

**Privacy**

****Mashed.com provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of Mashed's website, located at  the domain Mashed.com (the "Mashed Website"). Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the Mashed Website.

**Information Collection and Use**

It is not necessary to provide Mashed with your personally identifiable information to use the Mashed Website, and Mashed does not collect personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of the Mashed Website.  If you contact Mashed by email through the Mashed Website, Mashed may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to Mashed in your message, to respond to you.  Mashed treats this information as it would treat any other unsolicited business correspondence, and has no obligation to keep this information confidential, nor to take any security measures to protect this information.

When you visit the Mashed Website, Mashed's servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, the IP address will be different every time you log on. Mashed uses Log Data to monitor use of the Mashed Website and the services we offer via the Mashed Website and for the Mashed Website's technical administration.

**Cookies**

Like many websites, Mashed also uses "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Mashed Website and the services offered via the Web Site. A cookie is a small data file that Mashed's servers transfer to your computer's hard disk. Mashed does not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. However, IP addresses are collected by the use of cookies.

Mashed mainly uses "session cookies", which enable certain features of the Mashed Website and services offered via the Mashed Website, to better understand how you interact with the Web Site and services we offer via the Mashed Website, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Mashed Website, and to improve the Mashed Website and services offered via the Mashed Website. Session cookies should be deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Mashed Website.

Mashed also uses a persistent cookie that stays on your computer after you leave the Mashed Website, for the sole purpose of ensuring that you receive a variety of Mashed content (also called "frequency-capping").

Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

Mashed cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties, to enforce and comply with the law. Mashed may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as Mashed, in its sole discretion, believes necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Mashed or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.

If any or all of the assets of Mashed are acquired by, or merged with another entity, Mashed will share with this entity some or all of the information collected through the Mashed Website.

**Security**

Because Mashed does not collect any personally identifiable information from the Mashed Website, Mashed does not take any specific security measures to protect the information we do collect.

**Links to Other Sites**

The Mashed Website may contain links to other web sites ("Linked Sites") operated by Mashed or third parties. Linked Sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information that Mashed collects through the Mashed Website. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. Mashed does not exercise control over third party Linked Sites. Your use of any Linked Site operated by Mashed is subject to the terms and conditions provided by Mashed for such Linked Site.  Mashed encourages you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

**Our Policy Towards Children**

The Mashed Website is not directed to children under 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided Mashed with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact Mashed at staff@Mashed.com.  If Mashed becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided Mashed with personally identifiable information, Mashed will remove such information from our files.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

Mashed reserves the right to change this policy at any time without prior notice. Any changes to this policy will be posted here.  You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
