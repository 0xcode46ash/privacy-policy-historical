# Mazda Australia Zoom-Zoom - Privacy Policy

### 1\. Introduction

Mazda Australia Pty Ltd (Mazda) and its dealer network are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers. Mazda is bound by the National Privacy Principles set out in _the Privacy_ Act 1988 (Commonwealth) (the **Act** ).

Mazda and its Dealer network will only collect, use or disclose personal information in accordance with the Act and this Privacy Policy.

Mazda may amend this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. The updated version will be available by following the “Privacy” link on Mazda’s website homepage, at [www.mazda.com.au](http://www.mazda.com.au/ "Mazda Australia Website"). Mazda may highlight changes to this Privacy Policy on its homepage, but you should check the Privacy Policy regularly for changes.

In this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means information or an opinion about a person whose identity is apparent, or can be reasonably ascertained, from the information or opinion.

### 2\. When do we collect personal information?

Mazda and its dealer network collect personal information in a number of ways. The most common circumstances in which we collect personal information are when a person:

  


  * takes a test drive at a Mazda Dealer;
  * purchases a new or used Mazda vehicle and/or Mazda Parts from a Mazda Dealer;
  * arranges finance for the purchase of a vehicle;
  * has a vehicle serviced and/or repaired at a Mazda Dealer;
  * enters a competition or trade promotion or responds to a survey or research conducted by Mazda or a Mazda Dealer;
  * requests a brochure, joins a mailing list or requests to be contacted for further information at either a Motor Show, Mazda Drive Day, other promotional day such as MDay or from the Mazda website.
  * enquires about a Mazda product or service from Mazda or a Mazda Dealer.
  * such as an independent supplier conducts business with Mazda.



### 3\. What personal information do we collect?

The types of personal information we collect from you will depend on the circumstances in which that information is collected.

In all cases, Mazda or the Dealer may collect contact details including your name, address, email address and phone and fax numbers. When you arrange a test drive or purchase a vehicle, or when we service your vehicle, we may also collect your driver’s licence details. When arranging finance for a purchase, we may also collect a range of financial information under the relevant finance agreement.

In some cases, Mazda or the Dealer may also collect demographic information, such as your age and/ or occupation. This information is sought to assist us to better understand and service our customers. This information is de-identified when input into our analysis projects or research tools, and we only use this information as aggregated demographic data.

Mazda and its Dealers do not require customers to provide any sensitive information. In the case ofbusiness related purchases, sensitive information in relation to an individual’s membership of a trade or similar association may be provided during the course of the transaction but we do not actively seek this information. If you do provide sensitive information to us for any reason, you consent to us collecting that information.

### 4\. What do we use personal information for?

The purposes for which your personal information will be used will depend on the circumstances in which that information is collected.

Mazda and the Dealer may use your personal information for the primary purpose for which you provided it. For example, when you have your Mazda vehicle serviced at a Mazda Service Centre, we may use the information you gave us to provide the service and to contact you about the service.

We may also use your personal information for purposes which are related to the primary purpose for which you provided it. For example, when you purchase a vehicle from a Mazda Dealer, we may use the information you provide to contact you with a reminder when the vehicle is due for a service.

We may also use your personal information to contact you with further information about Mazda’s, and Mazda Dealers’, products and services, unless you indicate that you do not wish to be contacted for this purpose. If you provide us with your telephone number, unless you indicate otherwise, we may contact you for this purpose by telephone. If you provide us with your email address or mobile phone number, unless you indicate otherwise, we may contact you for this purpose by email or SMS.

### 5\. To whom do we disclose personal information?

Except as described below, it is not Mazda’s policy to disclose your personal information to any person without your consent.

Mazda and its Dealers share personal information, so Mazda may disclose personal information to its dealers and vice-versa.

We may disclose personal information to contractors (such as mailing houses and IT providers) who require access to that information to perform services for us. We require these contractors to keep that personal information confidential and not to use or disclose it for any purpose other than the purpose of performing those services.

When arranging finance for a purchase, a Mazda Dealer may disclose personal information to the relevant finance company and to others in accordance with the finance agreement.

In exceptional circumstances, we may be required or authorised by law to disclose personal information, for example to law enforcement authorities or to prevent a serious threat to public safety.

### 6\. How is personal information secured?

Mazda has implemented standards of technology and operational security in order to protect personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorised alteration or destruction. Only authorized personnel are provided access to the personal information covered by this Privacy Policy.

### 7\. Accessing and updating your personal information

Any person may seek access to personal information which Mazda or its Dealers holds about that person and we will provide access to that information in accordance with the Act. There are certain exemptions which may apply to the provision of that information. We may require that the person requesting access provide suitable identification and we may charge an administration fee for granting access to information.

If you become aware that any personal information which we hold about you is incorrect, you may contact Mazda to correct or update that information.

Requests for access to, to correct or update personal information held by Mazda or its dealers should be addressed to the Privacy Officer at [privacy@mazda.com.au](mailto:privacy@mazda.com.au?subject=Mazda%20Privacy%20Policy) or Private Bag 323, Mount Waverley BC, Victoria 3149. Where necessary in order to deal with the request, Mazda will pass the request on to the relevant Dealer, who will respond to the request.
