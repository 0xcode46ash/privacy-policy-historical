# MailWorkZ Privacy Statement

**What Information We Gather and Track**

There are times when we may need information from you. This generally involves filling out forms so you can download or order a MailWorkZ product. When you download our products, we require you to fill out a form with your name and email address. If you wish to remove yourself from our mailing lists at any time, you may do so by contacting our sales department.

When you submit an order online, your credit card number is submitted to the credit institution for routine processing. Your personal credit history information is not collected by MailWorkZ, and MailWorkZ does not share credit or credit card information with other companies or third parties. 

**What We Do With the Information We Gather and Track  
**  
The information gathered from the forms you fill out is used in one of three ways: 

1\. to provide you with information about products, services, news and events 

2\. to allow you to purchase and download products, and   
3\. to gather broad demographic information about user trends.
