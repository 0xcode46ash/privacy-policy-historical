At SimplyCast, it is our intent to give you as much control as possible over your privacy in regards to your personal information and how we use it in our business. In general, you can visit SimplyCast on the web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself.

### What Information We Gather and Track

There are times when we may need information from you. This generally involves filling out forms so you can download or order a SimplyCast product. When you download our products, we require you to fill out a form with -your name and email address. If you wish to remove yourself from our mailing lists at any time, you may do so by contacting our customer care department, by email [customercare@simplycast.com](mailto:customercare@simplycast.com) or phone 1-877-312-4979.
