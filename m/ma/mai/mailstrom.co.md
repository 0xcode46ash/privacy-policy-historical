## Users of Our Website, Applications and Services

Like most operators of web services and applications, Mailstrom collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each user request. Mailstrom’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Mailstrom’s users use its website. From time to time, Mailstrom may share or release non-personally-identifying information as described below. 

Mailstrom also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Mailstrom does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain users of Mailstrom’s services choose to interact with Mailstrom in ways that require Mailstrom to gather personally-identifying information. Mailstrom may gain access to personally-identifying information due to the user signing-up or using the service via a third party, such as Google. For example, Mailstrom may collect your name, email address and email credentials when you register for the service and may collect, retain and use the email address you use when you make inquiries.

The amount and type of information that Mailstrom gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Mailstrom collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user’s interaction with Mailstrom. Mailstrom does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain activities.

Mailstrom may share your personally identifying information if the disclosure is done as part of a purchase, transfer or sale of services or assets (e.g., in the event that substantially all of the company's assets are acquired by another party, customer information may be one of the transferred assets).

****Children’s Privacy. This service is not designed nor intended to be attractive to use by children under the age of 13. Mailstrom does not knowingly collect from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13 please do not submit any information.

## Aggregated Statistics and Anonymous Data

Mailstrom may collect statistics about the behavior of its users. For instance, Mailstrom may reveal how many emails were processed, the breakdown of browsers used, the most frequent email senders unsubscribed from, or trending topics.

Mailstrom may gather anonymous (i.e. not personally-identifying) data from emails in order to discover and analyze market trends. Mailstrom may share such anonymous data with third parties. Such data is not personally-identifying and is not used to identify or target individuals.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Mailstrom discloses personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Mailstrom’s behalf or to provide services available via Mailstrom. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Mailstrom, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Mailstrom discloses personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Mailstrom believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Mailstrom, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Mailstrom and have supplied your email address, Mailstrom may occasionally send you an email to tell you about relevant user activity on Mailstrom, new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Mailstrom. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.

Mailstrom does not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Mailstrom uses cookies to help Mailstrom identify and track visitors, their usage of Mailstrom, and their preferences. Mailstrom visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Mailstrom, with the drawback that certain features of Mailstrom may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Mailstrom does not use technology that responds to “do not track” signals from your web browser.

Mailstrom allows selected third parties such as Google to place cookies through the service to provide us with better insights into the use of the service or user demographics or to provide relevant advertising to you. These third parties may collect information about a consumer’s online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our service.

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Mailstrom may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Mailstrom’s sole discretion. Mailstrom encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this service after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
