For example, we may detect the type of browser you are using and use that information to redirect you to a section of the MailUp Web Site that works best for your browser, and use the same information to increase browser compatibility over time. Similarly, we may attempt to detect your geolocation and direct you to a version of the MailUp Web site that is written in a language that might better match your needs.

We never use or share Personal Information in ways unrelated to the ones described in this Privacy Policy, and we will not do so in the future without providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. **Use of Detailed Personal Information** We collect detailed personal information about you and your business when you order the MailUp Service, becoming a User of the Service. We do not share Detailed Personal Information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to create and manage your MailUp account and billing subscription.
