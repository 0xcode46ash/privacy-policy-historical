Mail2World stores, processes and maintains your Contacts data in order to provide the service to you. Any third-party contact's personal information that you may have entered into Contacts (e.g., friends, family, coworkers) is private and is not used for any purpose by Mail2World.

**When I import my address book from another email account, how is that information handled?**

Mail2World offers an Import Contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts that you may have listed in other email address books. Through our Import/Export Wizard, we make it easy for you to manually step through the process of accessing your contact information (e.g., Gmail account, .CSV file, vCard), then the Wizard automatically imports the contact information (i.e., contact names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, etc.) into your Mail2World Contacts. 

Mail2World's Contacts also allows you to request updates from your contacts by clicking the Request Update button in a contact's information panel. The invitation to update will be delivered in an email message displaying your "From" name, and the subject line will read: "[Contact's Name]: Update Your Contact Info."

In addition to the use of Personal Information to operate the site, Mail2World also gathers anonymous information, which may be used by Mail2World or shared with its advertisers. This is information which does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. Generally, this information is collected through "traffic data" or "log files" and may entail the use of "IP addresses", "Protocol version", "Total access time", or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.
