## Mailtrust Privacy Statement

[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.mailtrust.com&sealid=102)

Mailtrust has created this privacy statement to demonstrate its commitment to the privacy of persons who visit www.mailtrust.com. This policy covers our privacy commitment to our website visitors who are not customers. Our agreement with our customers includes additional privacy, security, and confidentiality obligations. 

### Web Visit

You may visit our website in any of the following ways: 

  * By using your browser to navigate to www.mailtrust.com;
  * By viewing an advertisement displayed on a third party website that is served content by our web server; or
  * By viewing an email that is served content by our web server.



When you visit our website in any of these ways, our server logs your IP address, the time and duration of your visit, and the time and duration of the pages on our website you view. 

We may also place a cookie on your hard drive during the web visit. A cookie is a unique alphanumeric identifier that we use to help us identify the number of unique visitors to our website. For example, if there are 1,000 visits to our website on a certain day, we can use cookies to discover how many of those visits were made via the same browser (same visitor). Most browsers can be set to refuse cookies if you do not want us to identify you as a repeat visitor.

We use web beacons to count the number of times that our advertisements and web-based email content are viewed. See "What is a Web Beacon" below. We combine web beacon information with cookies to track activity on our website originating from advertisements and web-based email content. 

We use web visit information to measure interest in and develop our web pages and marketing plans, customize the content you view on your web visits based on your activity on past visits, and administer our website.

Web visit information may be tied to your personal information if you submit personal information via our website, or become a customer (including a demonstration customer).

Our advertising agencies may also use web beacons and cookies to track your activity on our website originating from the advertisement. However, we will not provide your personal information to our advertising agencies. Our advertising agencies maintain their own privacy policies, and you should also review those.

### Personal Information

If you request information about our services using a web form, you will be asked to submit your contact information, and possibly general demographic and financial information, as part of the form. We will use your contact information to get in touch with you. We will use any demographic/financial information you provide to customize the information about our services that we provide to you. We will not covertly gather any personal information about you. We may tie your personal information to web visit information we have about you for the purpose of developing our web pages and marketing plans and to customize the content you view on your web visits.

If you would like us to delete your personal information from our records, we will do so. Please send your request in writing to via email support@mailtrust.com, or regular mail to the address posted at [http://www.mailtrust.com/contact-us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us).

### Email Opt Out

We will not send you email unless you have affirmatively indicated that you wish to receive it. You may opt out of our email list at any time by following the directions in our email to you, by contacting support@mailtrust.com, or calling or writing us. Our current contact information is posted at [http://www.mailtrust.com/contact-us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us). 

### Security

Web visit information and personal information you submit via a web form is stored on secure servers.

### Sharing Information with Third Parties

We may release personal information and web visit information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce our legal rights, or to protect the rights and safety of others. We may also release information to third parties who provide services to us, but these third parties will be bound by confidentiality agreements, and will be permitted to use the information only for the purpose of providing their services for us. If we ever sell our business, your web visit and personal information will likely be included with the transferred assets. 

### What is a Web Beacon?

A web beacon, also known as a web bug, is a small graphic (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel), that is embedded in a web advertisement, email, or page on our web site, but is invisible to you. When you view a page on our web site, an email or an advertisement your web browser will request the web beacon from a web server, which in turn will set a cookie in your web browser containing a unique identifier. This unique identifier will be linked to log information that is used to track your movements on our web site in order to determine the effectiveness of content and advertising campaigns. 

### EU Safe Harbor

Mailtrust complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of data from the European Union. Our Safe Harbor certificate can be found at http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe+harbor+list.

### Children's Online Privacy Protection

Our services are not designed for or directed to children under the age of 13, and we will not intentionally maintain information about anyone under the age of 13.
