## Latest Maine Memories

[Kenduskeag Stream Canoe Race](http://memoir.mainetourism.com/memoir/Kenduskeag-Stream-Canoe-Race/4db1d7e7-7574-4903-84eb-7649ad2de791)  
My brother and I raced in the KSCR last weekend. I have run it a bunch of times, but this was his first time, he enjoyed. We managed to stay out of the drink too.

[Acadia National Park](http://memoir.mainetourism.com/memoir/Acadia-National-Park/4d8213d6-3f14-4aa7-94e6-4a80ad2de791)  
On a Saturday, my family and I spent the day in Bar Harbor. We spent several hours on the top of Cadillac Mountain looking at boats. Then we went to Ben and Bills for ice cream.
