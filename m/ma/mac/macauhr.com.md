Information About All MacauHR.com Visitors   
We gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access the most. We only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you.

**Use and Disclosure of the Information We Collect Resumes**  
We give you the option of putting your resume in our database. For the job seekers, once you register MacauHR.com and fill in your resume, your resume will be stored in our database and be searched by all the company members.

When you grant us your permission, we will communicate with you regularly with tips, advice and survey information on using the macauHR.com site to maximize your career development. macauHR.com also provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of these types of communications. If you choose to receive these types of communications at the time of registration, but later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply log in to your account and edit your account profile.

If you input your information on a co-branded registration page, such as that of a macauHR.com and partner company-sponsored contest, then your information will be collected, used and becomes the property of both macauHR.com and the partner co-sponsoring the contest. In that instance, macauHR.com is not responsible for the information that the partner company receives or how it is used.
