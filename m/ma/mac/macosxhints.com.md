# Macworld | Macworld

At Macworld, we understand that privacy is important, and we've created this policy to give you information about how we collect and use personal information. Our policy is divided into three main sections: Section 1 describes how we collect and use data from users of Macworld.com, Macuser.com, and Macosxhints.com, which together are referred to in this policy as the "Macworld sites." Section 2 describes how we collect and use data from subscribers to the print and electronic editions of Macworld magazine. And because Macworld is owned by International Data Group (IDG) and is part of the IDG Publishing Network of technology publications, Section 3 presents the privacy policy for the IDG Publishing Network.

We reevaluate this policy on an ongoing basis, and we value your feedback. If you have questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, we ask that you contact us at:

> Customer Service  
>  Mac Publishing LLC  
>  501 Second Street

Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. We will post the new policy on this page, and, if the changes allow us to use personally identifying information in ways that are different from the ways specified at the time the information was originally collected, our Web site will contain a special notice about the changes. Each version of this privacy policy will be identified by its effective date, which you can find at the bottom of the page.

### 1\. Macworld Online Privacy Policy

Macworld collects data, including personally identifying information, from people who use the Macworld Web sites. This section of our privacy policy explains how we collect and use this data.

If you have not registered on our site, we cannot link the user ID in the cookie with personal identifying information and data about you, such as your name or e-mail address.
  * Traffic and advertising data. Other cookies are used to enable Macworld and our advertisers and service providers to gather and analyze site traffic and usage information, and to manage the content and advertisements presented. These cookies sometimes work in conjunction with other techniques, such as clear GIFs or pixel tags. The cookies placed by Macworld do not contain personally identifying information, but they may gather information about what sites and types of content you have visited and use that information to determine which content and ads appear when you visit various Web sites, including the Macworld sites.
  * Third party advertising companies. We use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads to you on our behalf when you visit the Macworld sites.
