# Machine Mart: No1 for Tools & Equipment

 

Your data is safe with us.  Unlike most companies we DO NOT share your information with other companies for their commercial use.

 Machine Mart respects your privacy, and this is why we have taken the time to disclose our information collection practices and our privacy policy.

  **Information we collect, and how it is used**

 Machine Mart collect data in order to help provide site users and customers with the best possible service. We do this in several ways. 

  **Personal Information:**  
Whenever you place an order we collect your name, postal address, email address and telephone number. 

 We use this information to process your order, and communicate with you in respect of your order where necessary.  We collect credit or debit card information including the card type, card number, start date and expiry date in order to process your order. 

 We also collect information when you request a catalogue, enter a competition or register for email updates. 

 We may use the information collected to notify you about new products, money saving offers, news and changes to our website and web service. At each point where you are asked to provide us with personal information you will be given the opportunity to tell us that you do not want your personal information to be used in this way. If you later decide that you no-longer wish to receive such information from Machine Mart, you can "Unsubscribe" from our updates at any time (see "Unsubscribing").

 We may also store and use information for the purposes of website and system administration, and fulfilment of customer service.  For example, we keep details of your purchase in order to maintain records relating to product warranties etc.

 We may analyse information collected for research, and for the development of our website and our services to benefit our website visitors and customers.  This may include building records of individual visitors, which are combined together for analysis of trends and patterns in the usage of our website. 

Under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Act we do not send random marketing emails to personal email addresses (spam).

   **Unsubscribing:**  
If you later decide that you do not wish to receive such information from Machine Mart, you can "Unsubscribe" from our updates at any time.  Each e-mail you receive will contain details of how to unsubscribe.

 You must tell us the email address that you would like to unsubscribe.  If your email is redirected from one email address to another, you should tell us the address to which we send our email updates.  You can e-mail us at unsubscribe@machinemart.co.uk, or alternatively you can write to us at:
