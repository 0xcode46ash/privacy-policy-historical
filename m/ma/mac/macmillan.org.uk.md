We use your information in the ways set out below unless you are specifically notified otherwise.

  * We use your personal information to give you the information, support, services, or products you ask for. 
  * We may also use your information for administrative purposes, to let you know about changes to our services or policies, to create a profile of your interests and preferences and, if you agree, we may also use your information to send you communications about our work and how you can help us to help you, for example, information about our campaigns, volunteering and fundraising activities. 
  * We will not sell your details to any third parties but we may sometimes share your information with our trusted service providers who are authorised to act on our behalf, our trading companies, and associated organisations who work on our behalf or whom we work with in partnership to deliver and improve services for people affected by cancer. In addition, from time to time we may exchange your personal information with other organisations for the purposes of fraud and credit risk reduction. In these circumstances we always require strict compliance with our instructions and, in the case of third party organisations, require that your personal information is not used for their own business purposes. 
  * We will always seek your consent to the use of your personal information by giving you the option to say ‘no’ to its use. In the case of sensitive personal information, we will ask you to indicate your express consent in allowing us to use it, which may involve one of the following methods: giving us your permission verbally; ticking a box; clicking an icon; sending an email; submitting a form; or subscribing to a service. When we seek your consent to using your personal information, we will tell you what we want to use it for and, other than as described in this policy, we won’t use it for any other purpose. 
  * Macmillan Cancer Support is responsible for collecting your personal information. Any information we collect is stored and processed in the UK, where this is not the case, we will inform you and where appropriate, seek your consent. Other than as set out in this policy or as required by law, your personal information is not shared with third parties or used in any other way unless you agree. 
  * When we collect your personal information we use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, Macmillan Cancer Support cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
