# Privacy Policy - Cancer Care Charity - Macmillan Cancer Support

This policy is written in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. If you have any questions about it please contact our Data Protection Compliance Officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, 89 Albert Embankment, London SE1 7UQ, email [webmanager@macmillan.org.uk](mailto:webmanager@macmillan.org.uk), or telephone 020 7840 7840. 

By continuing to use this Site you are signifying your agreement to the terms of this privacy policy. 

###  What personal information do we collect? 

Personal information is information that can be used to identify you. It can include your name, date of birth, email address, postal address, telephone number, fax number and credit/debit card details. 

We collect personal information when you ask about our activities, register with us (for example, registering on a discussion board), order products and services (such as publications and email newsletters), make a donation to us, or otherwise give us personal information. 

###  How do we use your information? 

We use your personal information to give you the information, services, or products you ask for. We can also use your information for administrative purposes, to let you know about changes and, if you agree, as part of our fundraising activities.  We sometimes also share your information with our service providers, trading companies, and associated organisations (who work with us to get the information you ask for). 

Macmillan Cancer Support is responsible for collecting your personal information. Any information we collect is stored and processed in the UK. Your personal information is not shared with third parties or used in any other way (other than described in this policy or as required by law) unless you agree. 

Where indicated - usually by a tick box asking for your permission (for example, the 'About you' sections of our online forms) - we use your personal information to create a profile of your interests and preferences. This information is not shared with other organisations. 

We reserve the right to share your personal information if we are legally obliged to and to enable us to apply our terms and conditions and other agreements. This includes exchanging information with other organisations for fraud and credit risk reduction. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, Macmillan Cancer Support cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. When we collect your personal information we use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access. 

###  How we use "cookies" 

Macmillan Cancer Support uses "cookies" to give you a more personalised web service. 

A cookie is a small text file we pass to your computer's hard disk through your web browser so the website remembers who you are when you return. 

We use a type of cookie called a "persistent" cookie. These cookies store information between visits. For example, if you tick the 'Remember me' box your email address and password is saved in a cookie on your computer. This means next time you log on to the site you will not need to re enter those details.  We suggest you do not select the 'Remember me' box if you use a shared computer (for example, if you access the Internet at an Internet Café, or at a university). 

###  Website analysis 

Macmillan Cancer Support works with Nedstats to track use of our websites. Nedstats use cookies to gather statistics about our visitors, such as where you come from before entering our websites and which websites you go to afterwards. Information collected in this way is anonymous and individuals cannot be traced. This information allows us to improve our websites, for example, to assess the impact of and develop campaigns and services. 

For more information about Nedstats, please see their privacy policy at [http://www.nedstat.co.uk/web/nedstatuk.nsf/pages/EINN_6FDBAJ?open&print](http://www.nedstat.co.uk/web/nedstatuk.nsf/pages/EINN_6FDBAJ?open&print)

If you do not wish to have cookies stored on your computer you can easily change your web browser to refuse cookies, or let you know when you get a new cookie. You need to refer to your Internet browser's instructions by clicking on the 'Help' menu. Refusing cookies, however, can restrict your use of our websites.  To enjoy Macmillan's websites to the full we recommend you leave cookies switched on. 

For more information about cookies, please see <http://www.cookiecentral.com/>

###  Privacy and our discussion boards 

Our discussion boards are moderated and we do not display the full names of individuals nor addresses. The posting of personal information in a discussion board means your information is publicly accessible. Such information can be viewed online and collected by third parties. We are not responsible for the use of information by such third parties. We strongly recommend all registered users to keep their postings anonymous. We also recommend you avoid sharing any personal information that can be used to identify you (such as your name, age, address, name of employer). 

For more information about how to use our discussion boards please see the 'House rules' page <http://share.macmillan.org.uk/Share/Forums/HouseRules.aspx>

###  Children's privacy 

Child safety is important to us. We do not collect personal information from people under the age of 18 except for our education site 'Why Bother' aimed at people between ages 13 and 18. If personal information given via our websites shows a visitor is a child, we will not allow the child to continue to give personal information and any personal information given will be deleted from our records. 

Our Why Bother website includes a discussion board. We moderate the board and do not show the full name of individuals nor addresses. Children should always ask a parent before sending personal information to anyone online. 

The What Now? community is for people aged 16 and over and we do not collect personal information from people under that age of 16 (if you are aged between 16 and 18 please obtain parental consent before you register).
