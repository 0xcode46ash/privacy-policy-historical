> **MacNN.com Privacy Statement**  
>  Updated: May 8, 2000. Version 1.11   
> 
> 
> Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to MacNN.com and its related sites. The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users. Below is information regarding MacNN's commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet.
> 
>  **User Information**
>
>> During your visit to the site, MacNN does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you that you do not specifically volunteer. This information may be volunteered when you create an account on the MacNN discussion forums located at <http://www.macnn.com/forums/>. However, even then, MacNN does not use that stored information for any purpose other than to allow you to log in and post messages.
>> 
>> MacNN does, however, automatically collect certain non-personally-identifiable information about you, such as your browser type and the IP address that your ISP designates to your machine (which, with dial-up accounts, usually changes every time you connect). This is standard practice for web sites, and is not used for any purpose other than to evaluate how we can design the site to best serve your needs. This information is not sold to any third parties, or available to anybody outside of the MacNN staff.
> 
> **Cookies**
>
>> MacNN, along with thousands of other Web sites, uses cookies to enhance your experience. Cookies are used in the MacNN discussion forums to keep track of which messages have been posted since your last visit, easing the navigation of the forums. Cookies can also store your user name and password so that you do not have to log in each time you want to post a message, though you must specifically request that this feature be turned on. You can do this by clicking on "prefs" in the MacNN discussion forums toolbar.
>> 
>> Cookie data is not stored on the server, and therefore, not available for viewing by MacNN staff or any third parties. However, it is possible that security flaws exist in some browsers that would allow other site administrators to write malicious scripts that would collect this data without MacNN's knowledge, though this is quite unlikely.
> 
> **Third-party Ad Server**
>
>> A portion of the advertisements displayed on the MacNN Network are served by DoubleClick, an Internet advertising company. We realize that DoubleClick has in the past been under public scrutiny for some of its practices and we are working with DoubleClick to address and allay concerns by our users. During this process, we encourage our readers to submit feedback directly to us at the address below.
>> 
>> DoubleClick gathers anonymous information from visitors through the use of cookies. This information may be added to other information about your anonymous cookie in order to better target advertisements to you. To learn more about the process or to opt-out of DoubleClick's collection of this information, [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/). 
>> 
>> DoubleClick employs several privacy initiatives to ensure that our reader's utmost privacy is maintained. This includes educating users on Internet privacy, doing business only with reputable sites and companies, establishing of a Consumer Privacy Advisory Board, and engaging PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to perform periodic privacy audits so that consumers can remain confident that DoubleClick is living up to its commitment to protect consumer privacy.
