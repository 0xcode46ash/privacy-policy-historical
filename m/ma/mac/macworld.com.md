# Macworld: Privacy Statement

  
**Privacy Statement**  
  


### Our Policy, in a Nutshell

  * Mac Publishing will not release your personal data to anyone else without your consent. 
  * Mac Publishing does not monitor individual traffic patterns on our site - only aggregate reader behavior is collected. 
  * If you have opted to receive special offers from Mac Publishing, you may change that decision at any time. 



We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, change, update or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting such addition, change, update or modification on this Web site. Any such addition, change, update or modification will be effective immediately at the time of such posting. Cookies A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. This is particularly important on the forums. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited and to allow easy access to restricted areas of the Web site. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. The Mac Publishing Web sites use cookies to track user traffic in aggregate. Our third-party adserver may also set or recognize a cookie in the course of serving an ad to you on this site. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. 

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use Macworld.com. 

###  e-Newsletters

Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page or by unsubscribing in the newsletter subscription area of our Web site. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration. You may correct your member information or select the option not to receive additional mailings by going to <http://www.macworld.com/newsletters/>. 

###  Macworld Advantage 

Mac Publishing offers users the option of subscribing to Macworld Advantage, a service providing e-mail notification of special deals and offers from third party product and service providers. Mac Publishing collects the e-mail addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe to Macworld Advantage and provides these e-mail addresses to Topica, an e-mail publishing service. Topica sends e-mail notifications to Macworld Advantage subscribers concerning special deals and offers that Mac Publishing feels will be of particular interest to Macworld readers. Users may remove themselves from the Macworld Advantage mailing list at any time by contacting [Macworld Weekly Unsubscribe](mailto:macworld_weekly-unsubscribe@macworld.email-publisher.com), and/or [Special Offers Unsubscribe](mailto:macworld_offers-unsubscribe@macworld.email-publisher.com). 

###  Use of the Information 

As stated above, Mac Publishing uses information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to move seamlessly through the Web site. We send newsletters out weekly, and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. 

It should be noted that we do not control the privacy policies of other Web sites to which we provide hyperlinks. Your linking to such Web sites is at your own risk and we encourage you to review the privacy policies for those sites. You should also be aware that if you decide to voluntarily disclose personal information to other users, such personal information could be collected and used by others. 

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your personal information private and not share it with third parties without your permission, unless such disclosure is necessary to comply with a court order or other legal process, or to protect the rights or property of Mac Publishing. 

We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. However, we cannot guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. 

Children under the age of thirteen should not submit personal information about themselves to this Web site or to any of its associated services. The Mac Publishing Web sites are not directed to children under the age of thirteen nor do we knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen.
