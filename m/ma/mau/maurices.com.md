POLICIES - Privacy Statement
maurices is committed to protecting the privacy of our web page users. We want to
provide a safe, secure user experience. We will use our best efforts to ensure that
the information you submit to us remains private, and is used only for the purposes
of assisting your search activities. We do not disclose information about your
personal information that you provide to any outside parties.
What personal information do you collect?
When you sign up on our website for maurices information, we need only your
name, mailing address, and e-mail address. When you enter a contest or other
promotional feature, we will ask only for the information needed to administer the
contest and notify the winner.
Do you share my personal information? If so, with whom?
We will not provide, sell, or trade your mailing address, e-mail address, or any
personal information to a third party with these exceptions:
    •   When we believe in good faith that the law requires it (i.e. when someone is
        suspected of being involved in illegal online activities)
    •   To protect the rights or property of maurices or its affiliates
    •   Under limited circumstances specifically described to you when we collect the
        information, as in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions
How else might maurices use my personal information?
To serve you better, we may combine information you give us online and in our
stores about your activities and product interests. We may use this information to
enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us and to provide you with
service and products tailored to your specific needs and interests.
Will maurices send me unsolicited e-mails?
No. Unless you sign up to receive information on our web site, or in one of our
stores, you will only receive an e-mail from us when you have e-mailed a specific
question or comment to maurices. If at any time you do not want to continue to
receive information, please contact us.
What about sales flyers and other mail from maurices?
Unless you have signed up in our stores or on our web site to receive our
promotional material through the mail, we will not send you unsolicited mailings.
If you have signed up, and decide that you do not want to continue to receive
these mailings, click here to unsubscribe.
