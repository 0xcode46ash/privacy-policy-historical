Please be assured of the caution we use regarding the personal information you provide during the checkout process. This information is used to process your order and email you a confirmation of the order plus the shipping information.

### Your Information Is Kept Secure

At mauijim.com, we utilize Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your credit card information. SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than mauijim.com. To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit your credit card information, please take a look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser. If you see either an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address will change from "http" to "https". Some browser versions and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at mauijim.com. If for any reason you cannot access the secure server, please feel free to place your order with us by phone at 1.888.666.5905.

Children under the age of 13 should always ask their parents or guardians for permission before providing any personal information to anyone online. We urge parents and guardians to participate in their children's online activities and use parental control or other web filtering technology to supervise children's access to the web.

If our information practices change in the future, we will notify you by posting the policy changes on our Web site and/or by communicating directly with you.
