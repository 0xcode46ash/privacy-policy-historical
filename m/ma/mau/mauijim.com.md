### Privacy and Security Policy

We at Maui Jim, Inc., Maui Jim USA, Inc., and other affiliated companies (collectively, the “Company”) believe strongly in protecting your privacy. That’s why we’re committed to the Direct Marketing Association’s “Privacy Promise to American Consumers.” We have agreed to:

  1. Provide customers with the notice of their ability to opt out of information rental, sale, or exchange with other marketers;

  3. Honor customers’ requests not to receive mail, telephone, or other solicitations from the Company.



###### Collecting Your Information

In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous, unless you voluntarily tell us who you are. Please be assured of the caution we use regarding the personal information you provide during the checkout process. This information is used to process your order and email you a confirmation of the order plus the shipping information. In addition, other internal uses for personal information received through our Web site may arise, which may include analyzing Web viewing trends and informing you of our new products to help enhance your shopping experience. In particular, we collect your information in the following ways:

  * Browsing: If you visit this site but do not buy or transact with the Company in any way, the website will set cookies on your browser and will collect browsing information. 
    * _Cookies:_ A "cookie" is a small amount of information stored on your hard drive which was sent to your Internet browser from a Web server. Cookies collect information on our behalf that will help us better understand how you navigate around the website and how we can target our products and services more effectively to suit your personal interests. In most instances, you are able to set your Internet browser to not accept cookies, or you can opt to be notified when a cookie is sent to your computer and then decide whether or not to accept it.
  * Creating an Account or Logging In: You may choose to log into the site. If you do not have an account, you may create an account without placing an order. If you do create an account, you will be given the option to “opt in” to our email system: 
    * Email Opt In: If you select this option, indicating that you are interested in getting updates from the Company, you will submit your email information and be added to our distribution list. We do not share the distribution list with other companies. You will then receive multiple emails, unless and until you decide to opt-out (for which there is also a clear process).
  * Shopping (whether as a guest or as a registered account-holder): You must enter an email address to shop on our website. Your email will be stored and used to track your orders, along with billing, shipping, and order information. Your credit card information is tokenized and processed as described below.
  * Submitting Repair Requests: You can submit a repair request online. If you choose to do so, your personal information relevant to the request will be required.

###### Sharing Your Information

Maui Jim, Inc., Maui Jim USA, Inc., and other affiliated companies do share information among themselves. However, we will not ever sell, trade or rent any of your personal information to third party websites or companies for commercial purposes.

At mauijim.com, we utilize Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your credit card information. SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than mauijim.com. To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit your credit card information, please check your browser to see either an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser during the order process. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address will change from "http" to "https". Some browser versions and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at mauijim.com. If for any reason you cannot access the secure server, please feel free to place your order with us by phone at 1.888.666.5905.

Your credit card information submitted on the website is stored and processed by a third party which has contractually agree to comply with all rules, regulations, standards, or guidelines adopted or required by the credit card payment brands (including, without limitation, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB) or the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council relating to privacy, data security, and the safeguarding, disclosure, and handling of Payment Instrument Information, including, without limitation, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, Visa’s Cardholder Information Security Program, Discover’s Information Security & Compliance Program, American Express’s Data Security Operating Policy, MasterCard’s Site Data Protection Program, Visa’s Payment Application Best Practices, the Payment Card Industry’s Payment Application Data Security Standard, MasterCard’s POS Terminal Security program, and the Payment Card Industry PIN Transmission Security program, in each case as they may be amended from time to time.

###### Protecting Children

The Company takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of children. Our website is a general audience site. We do not permit anyone who tells us that he/she is under the age of 18 to register with us. We also do not send email correspondence to anyone who tells us that they are under the age of 18 without their parent's consent. Children under the age of 18 should always ask their parents or guardians for permission before providing any personal information to anyone online. We urge parents and guardians to participate in their children's online activities and use parental control or other web filtering technology to supervise children's access to the web.

###### Policy Changes

If our information practices change in the future, we will notify you by posting the policy changes on our website and/or by communicating directly with you. We will notify you of any such change before we use your information in a manner not previously disclosed in our privacy policy. You will have the opportunity at that time to opt out of any new use of your information.

###### Third Party Websites

Our website may contain links to other sites that are not under our control. These websites have their own policies regarding privacy, which we recommend that you read and review before visiting. We provide these linked websites only for the convenience of our visitors and are not responsible for these sites.

###### Feedback From Our Visitors
