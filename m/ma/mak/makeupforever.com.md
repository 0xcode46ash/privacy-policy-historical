##  Security

While MAKE UP FOR EVER will take reasonable precautions to protect the security and integrity of Personal Information, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, We cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information.

We urge you to protect your own privacy. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone or share your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail.

Unfortunately, despite all of our efforts, there is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions. This reality is true of all Internet use. As a result, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit, and you transmit all information at your own risk.

If you contact Us by e-mail or a "contact us" or similar feature on our Website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.

If you choose to become a registered user, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use of the Sites by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee or agent. You agree to (a) immediately notify MAKE UP FOR EVER of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. It is your responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your account, and notify MAKE UP FOR EVER when you desire to cancel your account. We are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.

We will not be liable for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.

We recommend that you change your password every three months. If you are using a public computer (e.g. at a library), or a shared computer, We urge you to log out of your account and our Sites altogether, and quit the browser application before you leave the computer. This will help prevent others from accessing your account and any personal information.

In the unlikely event that We believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, We may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, We would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, We may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.

##  Consent to Processing

By providing Personal Information to Us, you understand and consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories.

##  Right to Opt Out

You may have the right to "opt out" of certain of our uses of your Personal Information. If you would like to opt out of receiving promotional emails from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions located at the bottom of each email. If you would like to opt out of receiving direct mail or telephone marketing calls from Us, or if you prefer that We not share your Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes, please send your request, including your name, email, street address, city, state, and zip code, via email to info@makeupforeverusa.com (please use the subject line: Privacy Opt-Out Request).

We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent improperly, or do not have complete information. We will process your request within 30 days of the date we receive your request, but you may, in the meantime, receive previously scheduled emails, mail or calls from us. We will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from entities that received your Personal Information prior to such date following your request. In these cases, please contact that entity directly. Once you have opted out, you do not need to do so again. Please note that MAKE UP FOR EVER may still use your Personal Information (and may share your information with our service providers) to provide you with services, including sending you administrative and transaction-related emails, relating to your online shopping needs and your other activity on MAKE UP FOR EVER's Sites.
