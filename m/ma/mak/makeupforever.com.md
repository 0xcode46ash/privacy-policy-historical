###  How do we protect your information?

While MAKE UP FOR EVER will take reasonable precautions to protect the security and integrity of Personal Information, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.

We do maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information.

We use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") authentication for online transactions made on our site. SSL authentication and encryption of the information that you send to us over the Internet helps protect your online transaction information from third party interception.

We never display your full credit card number once it has been entered. We will only reveal the last four digits of your credit card for verification purposes.

Unfortunately, despite our efforts, there is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions. This reality is true of all Internet use. As a result, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit, and you transmit all information at your own risk. We will not be liable for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.

If you contact Us by e-mail or through a "contact us" link or similar feature on our Website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.

If you choose to become a registered user, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use of the Website by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee or agent. You agree to (a) immediately notify MAKE UP FOR EVER of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session (especially if you are using a public computer or a shared computer). It is your responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your account, and notify MAKE UP FOR EVER when you desire to cancel your account. We are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, We would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.

###  What are your choices about your personal information?

  * RIGHT TO OPT OUT

You can also call Customer Service at 1 (855) 575-3820 or go online to your account page on the Site and change your email and marketing preferences at any time.

We will process your request within 30 days of the date we receive your request, but you may, in the meantime, receive previously scheduled emails, mail or calls from us. We will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from entities that received your Personal Information prior to such date following your request.
