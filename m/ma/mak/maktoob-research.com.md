# Yahoo! Maktoob Research: Online research made quick, easy and cost-effective

Yahoo! Maktoob Research is strongly committed to its member's privacy. We try to make sure that the personally identifying information remains private. We will not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose our member's information to anyone outside of Yahoo! Maktoob, and its affiliated companies. We will never mislead our members about the nature of our research, nor misuse the data provided to us. We execute all our online research programs, using approved scientific methods.

  **Identity will remain confidential**     
Our member's identity and their answers will be treated as confidential, unless we have taken prior permission from them. Occasionally, we may ask our members for permission to pass on data in a form which allows them to be personally identified, but this information will be used for research purposes only. We will not send any unsolicited emails or pass on our member's email addresses to others for this purpose.

  **Cooperation is voluntary**  
As with all forms of market and opinion research, cooperation is voluntary at all times. No personal information will be sought from our members without their prior knowledge and agreement. At any stage of the interview, or subsequently, they can request that a part of or their entire interview be destroyed or deleted. Whenever reasonable and practical, we will carry out such a request. 

  **Usage of cookies**  
We use cookies and other similar devices sparingly and only for quality control, validation and to prevent bothersome repeat surveying. 

  **Invisible processing**  
We automatically capture information about our member's browser type, operating system, username and IP address in order to deliver an interview best suited to their software. We do no other invisible processing of data from their computer. 

  **Security**  
Our website has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, theft and modification of the data that our members have provided to us. Only select employees in our organization have access to the information that they have provided. This data will be used for data analysis and quality control purposes only. 

  **Email Marketing**  
As a specialist in online marketing research, we at Yahoo! Maktoob Research know how important your privacy is and we are committed to making protection of your privacy a top priority. The personal information given to us will be used to assist us in providing you with information about our company and services offered. Yahoo! Maktoob Research will never share your individual personal information with any third party.

  **Contact**
