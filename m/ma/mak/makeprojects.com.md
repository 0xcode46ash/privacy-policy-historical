## 1\. Information We Collect ¶ 

Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) means information that can be directly associated with you (such as your name, email address, or telephone number), or information about activities directly linked to you (such as products or services that you have purchased). We collect PII in the following ways:

**_1.1 Information that you provide to us directly:_**

  * When you contact or communicate with O’Reilly, we may gather information such as your name, physical address, email address and phone number;
  * When you participate in a promotional offer or purchase products or services, we may gather information regarding your participation or purchase, and payment information such as your credit card number.
  * When you register for an online account, subscribe to a newsletter, participate in community or an event, program, class or promotion, or click on a URL, we may gather user preferences, product interests, industry focus, community choices and other customer profile information.



**_1.2 Information we collect through technology related to our products and services_**

Certain products and services that you obtain from us may connect and transmit telemetry and system/product data to us or our agents. This data may include, but is not limited to, system model, operating system, host ID and IP address.

We use this information to manage and administer our products and services, and as the basis for advising you of the availability of updates and new versions, providing agreed upon testing and monitoring of services that we provide, enhancing our products and services, and improving and targeting our communications with you.

**_1.3 Information we collect through online technology_**

When you are on O’Reilly's websites, we collect information about the pages you visit. Some web pages use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to automatically collect information from you. We may send one or more cookies (small text files containing a string of characters) to your computer to uniquely identify your browser. We may use "web beacons" (electronic images also known as pixel tags or clear gifs) to recognize an O’Reilly cookie on your computer when you view or act upon an O’Reilly web page, an O’Reilly advertisement posted on a third-party web page, or an email from us.

Cookies, web beacons and similar technologies enable us to collect information about your visits to our websites, such as:

  * Internet Protocol Address
  * Browser type
  * Operating system
  * Referring site (site you visited before coming to our site)
  * Date and time of visit
  * URL of pages visited
  * Other browsing behavior, such as products and white papers downloaded



Most browsers allow you to remove and block cookies and web beacons. If you do so, you will need to re-enter your user name and password to access certain parts of our web sites and you will be served only generic information that is not focused on your specific interests. Also, you may not be able to use certain O’Reilly web site features or take full advantage of our offerings.

**_1.4 Information from other sources_**

• From time-to-time we may receive information from other sources, such as commercial contact lists or companies that we acquire, and we may combine that information with information previously collected.

• If you give us PII on behalf of someone else (or someone else gives us PII on your behalf), we require that the person providing the PII to us must have consent to do so from the person whose information is provided.

• Some O’Reilly events, web sites or services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with a third party. When you provide PII in relation to them, both O’Reilly and the third party(ies) may receive the information collected and use the information according to each company's privacy policy and agreement with you.

## 8\. Children's Privacy ¶

Although we strive to protect our users’ privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information that you post in these environments. Disclosures of personal information that you make in those environments are at your own risk, and we recommend that you consider carefully what you post before you post it.
