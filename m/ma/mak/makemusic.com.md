# Privacy Statement for MakeMusic

### PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT CAREFULLY.

MakeMusic, Inc. (the “Company”) has a strong commitment to protecting personal privacy. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to tell you about our privacy practices for the website or application where this Privacy Statement is published.  Please read this Privacy Statement to learn what information we collect, how we use the information, and how we protect your privacy.

This Privacy Statement applies to all Company websites and Company mobile applications that include a link to (the “Sites”), including the pages on our Sites where you subscribe or register as a user of one of our products. This Privacy Statement does not apply to information we gather by mail, telephone, or other off-line methods.

This Privacy Statement was last revised on July 29, 2013. We may change this Privacy Statement at any time and for any reason. We encourage you to look to this Privacy Statement each time you visit this Site. By using this Site or our software or services that reference this Site, including our SmartMusic®, Garritan® and Finale®  products, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement. If you have any questions about the changes please contact us by mail or phone as listed below.

### PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY

The ways we protect and use information collected over our Sites depend upon the type of information and the reason that we collected it. In general, personal information – information that tells us who you are – is used for limited purposes and receives strong protection. Anonymous, non-personally identifiable information is used for many purposes and shared with others, as described below.

### HOW DO WE COLLECT, USE, AND PROTECT ENROLLMENT INFORMATION REGARDING STUDENTS?

Enrollment information is a student’s name, birthdate, address, phone number, identification number, scores, class, grade, school district, school, music teacher’s name, and a user name and password created by the student.  In the case of students under the age of 13, enrollment information also includes contact information for that student’s parent or guardian. Enrollment information also may include non-public school information that is provided to us by a student’s teacher or school district, such as a student’s grade or identification number.

We will use enrollment information to notify the parent or guardian of an enrollee under the age of 13 of the student’s enrollment, and to give the parent or guardian information regarding their right to cancel the enrollment and to access and manage the enrollment information.  We use enrollment information to enable the student to submit assignments to their music teacher, and to allow the music teacher to issue and manage assignments and contact their students through a web-based assignment and e-mail program.  We also use enrollment information to manage and renew subscriptions, if the enrollee decides to subscribe to one of our products (in which case the information becomes subscription/registration information, and can be used by us in the additional ways described below.)

We will share enrollment information with the teacher and school associated with the enrollment.   We may share information in connection with a change of control of the Company, merger, transfer, or sale of all or part of the Company or similar transaction, with a vendor who needs the information to provide services to us, or if required to comply with a law, regulation, court order, or other legal process.

We will not use enrollment information (including any of the non-public school information) for any other purposes.  We will not give enrollment information to a third party to allow that third party to market its goods or services, and we will not use it to market our own services.  We will not convey, copy, transfer, or otherwise disclose enrollment information, including non-public school data, in any other way without prior written authorization.  We will maintain these protections for enrollment information data even after a student (or his or her school) stops using one of our music grade book products

### **HOW DO WE COLLECT, USE AND PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM OTHER USERS?**

We may collect other personal information, including a name, email, and other contact and personal information, such as payment and financial information, or home address, from you if you buy one of our products or services or register for a feature on one of our Sites.  We refer to this personal information as “subscription/registration information.” Subscription/registration information also includes other information associated with a user, such as password or subscription number.  For example, if you fill out a form to receive and pay for services through one of our Sites, you will tell us and we will learn your name and some other personal information about you.  If you submit personal information as part of a subscription for a product, or registration for an online forum or other feature, you agree that we may keep a record of the personal information. For example, we may keep a record of your name and e-mail address in order to keep track of your username and password. We also may use subscription/registration information to help us in our business, including but not limited to improving our Sites and our products, and to contact you with information about our products and services. ****

We may share subscription/registration information with third party service providers who help us with our business.  For example, if you pay for services by credit card, we will share your name with the credit card company, such as Visa or MasterCard, so that we can get paid.  These other companies may not use or share your personal information with others except for the purpose of assisting us with our business activities pursuant to our request. We also may share your personal information with our trusted business partners, such as our distributors, to allow them to contact you with information about other products that may interest you, unless you elect not to receive such information.

We may share subscription/registration information in connection with a change of control of the Company, merger, transfer, or sale of all or part of the Company or similar transaction, or if required to comply with a law, regulation, court order, or other legal process. We may share subscription/registration information to protect our rights or property.

Please note that when you share information with the Company through one of our Sites, you are sending your information to a location in the United States and it will be handled in accordance with the laws of the United States.

We may prepare reports and other materials using non-personal information, including ammonized enrollment or subscription/registration information. Since these reports and materials contain no personal information, we may share them with others.

### WHAT HAPPENS IF THE PRIVACY STATEMENT CHANGES?

### ARE THERE SPECIAL RULES ABOUT CHILDREN’S PRIVACY?

We care about protecting the online privacy of children. We may collect certain information about children for the purpose of providing our educational services as described in the sections above regarding enrollment information.  When we collect enrollment information, we ask for a student’s birthdate to determine whether the student is a child under the age of 13. Other than enrollment information, we collect information from children under 13 only with the prior consent of a parent or guardian. If you believe that we have improperly collected information from a person under the age of 13, please send us a letter by First Class Postage Prepaid U.S. Mail or overnight courier to the following address:
