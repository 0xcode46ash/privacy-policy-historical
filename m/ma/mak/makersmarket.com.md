# Privacy Policy – Maker Media

**Notification of Changes**  
This privacy policy was put in effect on December 3, 2014. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here.

**Purpose and Scope**  
We want to help makers like create projects, share ideas, and build a community. To make this happen, we collect some information from our users. Maker Media Inc. understands how important privacy is to hour community so we wrote this privacy policy to explain what information we collect, how we use it, and what we’re doing to keep it safe. If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, you can contact us by sending email to [webmaster@makermedia](mailto:webmaster@makermedia) _._ This policy discloses what information we gather about you when you visit any of our websites or buy product directly from us. It describes how we use that information and how you can control it.

**Information Maker Media gathers and tracks**  
Maker Media collects two kinds of information about users: 1) data that users volunteer by signing up to receive news and product information, entering contests, completing surveys, or buying directly from us; and 2) aggregated tracking data we collect when users interact with us.

**Personal information**  
We never sell or rent your email address or other personally identifiable information. We use the personal information you provide voluntarily to send you information you’ve requested and to fulfill orders. The specific use of your personal information varies, depending on how you contact us:

  * When you sign up online to receive Maker Media newsletters, we use your email address to distribute the newsletter and administer your account.
  * When you register for a Maker Media event, we will send you email announcements and updates about Maker Media events and conferences.
  * When you order directly from us, we add you to our newsletters list, and we’ll send you update emails and other marketing pieces.
  * When you enter a contest or giveaway, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can administer the contest and communicate with entrants about the results.
  * Third parties we retain to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, managing mailing lists, and delivering packages are restricted from using your information for any other purpose.
  * We release personal information when we believe that release is appropriate to comply with the law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Maker Media, our users, or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.



**Aggregated tracking information**

We also share this anonymous traffic and demographic information in aggregate form with advertisers and other business partners. We do not share any information with advertisers that can identify an individual user.

**Cookies**

**Third Party Services**  
We may disclose certain of the information we collect to third-party service providers that help us manage communications to and from the Maker Media websites and improve website performance.

  * **User-generated Content:** All of your MakerSpace projects, comments, and forum posts are stored on the Maker Media, Inc. servers.

The analytics acquire all information directly from the user, by installing a cookie (see the section on Cookies, above) on your computer, if you have enabled JavaScript.
