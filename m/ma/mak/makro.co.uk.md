**Identity Protection:** Any information you provide may be used to verify your identity and assist Makro in preventing or detecting fraud. As part of these checks your information may be disclosed to credit reference agencies, who may keep a record of that information.

We recommend that you check the privacy and security policies of each website you visit. Cookies and similar devises such as web bugs may be used by us to provide you with customised information from our website. A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your browsers, which may then store it on your system. 

**Cookies:** allow us to understand who has seen which pages and advertisements, to determine how frequently pages are visited and to determine which are the most popular areas of our website. We may use cookies so that we can give you a more personalised experience when returning to our website.

**Third parties:** We may supplement the information that you provide to us with information that we receive from other parties.
