# PTZtv - Privacy Policy

**What information do we collect?**

You may visit our _free-to-view_ sites anonymously and are not required to register or sign-in. If you choose to register for our PTZtv Premium service, you will be required to provide an email address.

If you choose to fill out and submit a contact or "wave request" form, you may be asked to enter your name, e-mail address or phone number.  
 

Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language and the date/time of your access.  
 

Our PTZtv Premium, PTZtv Gallery and PTZtv WebcamWare websites can involve eCommerce transactions if you choose to purchase from them. Those transactions necessitate the sharing of more personal information, including credit card numbers if that payment method is selected.  
 

PTZtv Premium transactions are handled by Tinypass/Piano and their privacy policy is [here](https://piano.io/privacy/).

PTZtv Gallery transactions are handled by SmugMug, Inc. and their privacy policy is [here](http://www.smugmug.com/aboutus/privacy/).

WebcamWare transactions are handled by CafePress, Inc. and their privacy policy is [here](http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/help/index.aspx?page=privacy_policy.aspx).

**How do we use your information?**

Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:

  * To improve our website. We continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you.
  * To improve customer service. Your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs.
  * To send periodic emails.
  * To protect our sites and our business from malicious or tortious interference.



The email address you provide may be used to send you information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.

We use your IP address to perform IP geolocation at the country/state of origin level.

**What are cookies?  
 **

Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enable the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

 

Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our sites.

Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visits to our sites and/or other sites on the Internet.

Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting the [ads preference manager](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/) or alternatively,  to opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for interest based advertising by visiting [aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/).

In addition, our sites use cookies to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and features in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.  
 

At this time, we contract with Google Analytics to provide site traffic analysis services and their privacy policy is [here](https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).

Tinypass/Piano use cookies as part of their paid content access service which is used by PTZtv Premium. Use of cookies is covered in their privacy policy linked above.

PTZtv does not currently place cookies on any of our webcam websites but may do so in the future for the sole purpose of saving and restoring viewer preferences and options.

**Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

**Email Policy**

We comply with the federal CAN-SPAM Act. You can always opt out of receipt of further email correspondence from us or our affiliates. We will not sell, rent, or trade your email address to any unaffiliated third-party without your permission except in the sale or transfer of our business.

**Third party links**

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our websites. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

**California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance**

Because we value your privacy we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

**Online Privacy Policy Only**

This online privacy policy applies only to information collected through our websites and not to information collected offline.
