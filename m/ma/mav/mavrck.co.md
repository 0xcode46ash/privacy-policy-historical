In operating the MAVRCK Services, we may set or access small pieces of data called “cookies” on your computer. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our MAVRCK Services gives to your browser when you access the MAVRCK Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the MAVRCK Services and help us analyze Web Site usage more accurately.

MAVRCK also permits third parties, including our Brands, to show advertisements on some of the MAVRCK Services and to set and access their cookies on your computer. Third parties’ use of their cookies is subject to their respective privacy policies and these third parties do not have access to MAVRCK’s cookies.  Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you block cookies, some portions of our Services may not work properly. The MAVRCK Services do not respond to Do Not Track signals.

_**Aggregated Data:  **_We may anonymize and aggregate data collected through the MAVRCK Services and use it for any purpose. Such information does not identify you individually.

You may also be able to modify your privacy settings with these Social Media Services to, for example, control what information the Social Media Services disclose to other entities, including MAVRCK. When you provide MAVRCK access to your Social Media Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the MAVRCK Services to access that Social Media Service, however you will provide your login information, like your password, directly to such Social Media Service (and not to MAVRCK).

To access your Social Media Services account, we provide a link that directs you to a Social Media Service, like Facebook, where you may access the MAVRCK Services directly. We will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and, if and to the extent applicable, the policies of such Social Media Services. However, please remember that the manner in which Social Media Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of the applicable Social Media Services provider, and, as a result, MAVRCK shall not have any liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of Social Media Services that may be enabled within and/or otherwise accessible through the MAVRCK Services.
