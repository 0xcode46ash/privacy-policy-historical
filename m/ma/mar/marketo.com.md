# Privacy - Marketo | On-demand solution for B2B lead generation

### What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?

This Statement covers Marketo’s collection of personal information that Marketo gathers when you are on the Site and when you use the Service.

This Statement does not apply to the practices of third parties that Marketo does not own or control, or to individuals that Marketo does not employ or manage. For avoidance of doubt, this Statement does not apply to any third party information gathered by Marketo’s subscribers when they use the Service. It only applies to information gathered by Marketo to provide the Service to its subscribers. 

### What Personal Information About Customers Does Marketo Collect?

Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. We collect the following types of information from our customers:

#### Information You Provide to Us: 

Marketo collects identifying information when you use the Service, when you visit the Site (including, without limitation, any marketo.com web pages or landing pages), and when you enter promotions or contests. For example, we require customers who register to use the Service to give us the following personal information: their name, Company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the identity of users within the organization that will be using the Service.  When you initially express interest obtaining additional information about the Service, or when you register for the Service, we may also ask for additional types personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, or additional company information, such as annual revenues or marketing spend. We may also request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to provide you with a more personalized experience or verify your passwords.

All financial and billing information that we collect from you is used for the purposes of checking your qualifications as a prospective customer and billing you for the Service. Such billing information is not used by Marketo for marketing or promotional purposes. Marketo may use a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card and billing processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card and billing processing. 

Customers of the Service will be using the Service to host and submit data and information relevant to their advertising campaigns and other promotional activities ("Customer Data"). Marketo will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided for in the Service Agreement or as may be required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer Data may at times be viewed or accessed by Marketo for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or for investigating a suspected violation of the Service Agreement, or as may be required by law.

#### Automatic Information:

  * We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us via our website. Marketo automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs including your IP address, Marketo cookie information, the page you requested, and your communications and interactions with other site registrants. Marketo uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Service. 
  * We automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and use of components of our Service. We may use this information to provide research, advice and information, including, without limitation, for benchmarking purposes (e.g. we may publish an industry white paper that uses data collected through the use of our Service). This data is only used in the aggregate. This type of collective data also enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Service so we can make the Service appealing to as many customers as possible. In addition, we may provide statistical information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Site and Service. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use areas of our Site and our Service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience. 
  * We also collect and use information for internal purposes. For example, if you are a registered user of the Marketo’s subscription-based Service, we may keep records in your account history of your complaints about other registered users online behavior, and any reported violation of our Service Agreement that you or someone on your account may have committed. 
  * Many companies offer programs that help you to visit web sites anonymously. While Marketo will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.



#### E-mail Communications:

We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Marketo if your computer supports this type of program, in order to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We may also send out emails with information regarding Marketo or our partners including promotions and events. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us by sending an email to [support@marketo.com](mailto:support@marketo.com?subject=Email%20Opt-Out).

If a user elects to use our referral features for informing a friend about our Site or Service, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Marketo will automatically send the friend an email on behalf of the user who made the referral, inviting such friend to visit the Site and try the Service. Marketo does not store this information.

#### Information From Other Sources:

For purposes such as improving personalization of our Service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.

### What about Cookies?

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Marketo employs cookies in order for its server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user. The cookies placed by the Marketo server are readable only by Marketo, and cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on a computer. 
  * The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Marketo’s most attractive features.



### Will Marketo Share Any of the Information it Receives?

Information about our customers is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone. We share your personal information only with entities that are controlled or controlled by or under common control of Marketo and as described below:

#### Affiliated Business We Do Not Control:

We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses operate within the Service or through the Site.  In other situations, Marketo provides other services, or sells products or services jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share customer information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business. 

#### Agents:

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples may include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. We may also provide your personal information to agents who will use it to verify aggregate usage data that we provide to our partners. 

#### Promotional Offers:

We may send offers to certain customers on behalf of other businesses. However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your name and address. If you are a registered user of the Marketo’s subscription-based Service and do not wish to receive these offers, please send an email to [support@marketo.com](mailto:support@marketo.com?subject=Promotional%20Offer%20Opt-Out).

#### Business Transfers:

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets or businesses. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Marketo, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, customer information would be one of the assets that are transferred.

#### Protection of Marketo and Others:

We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Marketo, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

#### With Your Consent:

Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties.

### Is Information About Me Secure?

  * Your Marketo Account Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer.

### What Information Can I Access?

You can access your personal information as part of our Service and correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate.

  * You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the "What Information Do I Have" section above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.
  * If you are a registered user of Marketo’s subscription-based Service, you may request deletion of your Marketo account by logging in to your account and selecting the "delete account" option. Please note that some information may remain in our records after deletion of your account.

  * As explained earlier, the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. Please note, however, that if you do not enable cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of some of our attractive features.
