Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

By accessing the Marketo website at [www.marketo.com](http://www.marketo.com/), including all related pages ("Site"), including any subscription based features or services offered by Marketo through the Site or through app.marketo.com (collectively, the "Service"), you are accepting the practices outlined in this Statement.

* **What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?**

This Statement covers Marketo's collection and use of personal information that Marketo gathers when you are on the Site and when you use the Service.

This Statement does not apply to the practices of third parties that Marketo does not own or control, or to individuals that Marketo does not employ or manage. 

For avoidance of doubt, this Statement does not apply to any third party information gathered by Marketo's subscribers (i.e., information about customers of Marketo subscribers) and submitted by them to the Service for use in connection with their marketing campaigns and other promotional activities ("Customer Data"). Marketo will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in the Service Agreement or as may be required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer Data may at times be viewed or accessed by Marketo for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or for investigating a suspected violation of the Service Agreement, or as may be required by law. Marketo adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by US Department of Commerce ("Safe Harbor Principles") with respect to Customer Data that we receive from our customers and other business partners in the European Economic Area.

* **What Personal Information About Customers Does Marketo Collect?**

Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. We collect the following types of information from our customers: 

**Information You Provide to Us:**  
Marketo collects identifying information when you use the Service, when you visit the Site (including, without limitation, any marketo.com web pages or landing pages), and when you enter promotions or contests. For example, we require customers who register to use the Service to give us the following personal information: their name, Company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the identity of users within the organization that will be using the Service.  When you initially express interest obtaining additional information about the Service, or when you register for the Service, we may also ask for additional types personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, or additional company information, such as annual revenues or marketing spend. We may also request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to provide you with a more personalized experience or verify your passwords. 

All financial and billing information that we collect from you is used for the purposes of checking your qualifications as a prospective customer and billing you for the Service. Such billing information is not used by Marketo for marketing or promotional purposes. Marketo may use a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card and billing processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card and billing processing.

If you are a registered user of Marketo's subscription-based Service, please note that some information about you may remain in our records after the end of your trial or subscription. 

**Automatic Information:**

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us via our website. Marketo automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs including your IP address, Marketo cookie information, the page you requested, and your communications and interactions with other site registrants. Marketo uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Service.

We automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and use of components of our Service. We may use this information to provide research, advice and information, including, without limitation, for benchmarking purposes (e.g. we may publish an industry white paper that uses data collected through the use of our Service). This data is only used in the aggregate. This type of collective data also enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Service so we can make the Service appealing to as many customers as possible. In addition, we may provide statistical information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Site and Service. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use areas of our Site and our Service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience.

We also collect and use information for internal purposes. For example, if you are a registered user of the Marketo's subscription-based Service, we may keep records in your account history of your complaints about other registered users online behavior, and any reported violation of our Service Agreement that you or someone on your account may have committed.

Many companies offer programs that help you to visit web sites anonymously. While Marketo will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.

Marketo will automatically send the friend an email on behalf of the user who made the referral, inviting such friend to visit the Site and try the Service. Marketo does not store this information. 

**Information From Other Sources:**
