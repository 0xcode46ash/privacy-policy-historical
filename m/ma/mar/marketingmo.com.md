# Marketing M.O. Privacy Policy

The Marketing M.O. Privacy Policy

We understand that you care how information about you is stored and shared.  In order to provide a safe, secure experience, we will make every effort to ensure that the information you give us remains private, and is used for the purposes described below.

## What information do we gather?

  
The Marketing M.O. gathers collective information about our website visitors.  An example of such is the number of visitors to the site, which areas of the site are visited most often and what services are most valued.  We use this aggregated and anonymous data to help us determine how we can create a better overall experience for our visitors.

We receive and store certain types of information whenever users interact with us.  For example, we use "cookies" to help us provide a more personalized experience.  To help us make emails more useful and interesting, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Marketing M.O. if your computer supports such capabilities.

The rest of the information we collect is the information you provide to us to utilize our product and services.

## Do we share the information we receive?

  
Information about our customers is an important part of our business.  At this time, we only use that information internally to service customers and website visitors and to send promotional offers.

## How secure is my information?

  
We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt information you input.  We only reveal the last five digits of your credit card during order processing to our credit card processing company.  

We do not store your credit card information in our database.  Our site has password security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.

## Opt-Out

  
Marketing M.O. provides members with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us.
