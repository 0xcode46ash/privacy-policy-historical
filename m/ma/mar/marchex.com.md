This Privacy Policy applies to the information Marchex collects on [marchex.com](http://www.marchex.com/), including the site’s customer log-in areas (our “Site”), and to the information we collect on behalf of our Clients in provision of our Analytics Services to our Clients. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use the personal information we collect on our Site and the information we collect on behalf of our Clients who use our Analytics Services. The Policy also describes the choices you have regarding our collection and use of your personal information. Our Site contains links to other third-party sites. We are not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or content of such sites since we do not control them.

Marchex has received TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this Privacy Policy and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy and TRUSTed Cloud program. The TRUSTe certification covers only our collection, use and disclosure of information we collect through our Site [ marchex.com](http://www.marchex.com/) and from customers of the Marchex Call Analytics services.

_**_Marchex Site_**_

_**What Information Do We Collect on our Site?**_

We may request that an entity applying for an account with Marchex, on our Site, provide us with certain personal information (such as name, email address, login information, etc.) relevant to our provision of services to the entity.

Our Site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [privacy@marchex.com](mailto:privacy@marchex.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

Our Site includes social media features, such as, Facebook and Twitter buttons and widgets. These features may collect information, including your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing such features.

We also collect information automatically from customers and Site users, as described below.

_Cookies_. Like most sites, for account management purposes, Marchex may use session ID cookies and persistent cookies, as well as web beacons and other monitoring technologies to compile statistics about Site users. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site, including your IP address, page(s) you visited and keyword searches you conducted on our Site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.

_Third-Party Analytics_. We use automated devices and third-party applications, such as Google Analytics to evaluate usage of our Site and Marketo to evaluate our email marketing. We and our third-party providers also may use other analytic means, such as clear GIFs to evaluate our Site and to help us improve our Site, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected. This Policy does not cover such third parties’ use of the data.

_**How Do We Use Information Collected on Our Site?**_

We may use the information we collect on our Site for account management purposes, such as to register and administer your account, to answer to your customer service requests and to communicate with you about your account.

Cookies, web beacons and related monitoring technologies enable us to track user trends, preferences and patterns. The information helps us provide improved services, develop new products, and provide customized content, including targeted advertising. As such, we may send periodic promotional or informational emails to customers and other users of our Site, including newsletters. You may opt out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your account or any purchases. Marchex does not use the information we collect via our Analytics Services to market Marchex services.

_Third-Party Ad Networks_. We may engage third parties to assist us in marketing Marchex services on third-party websites. For example, we may engage third parties, such as network advertisers, to display Marchex ads on third-party websites after you have visited our Site. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your use of our Site and other third-party website and mobile applications. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.

You may opt out of many website third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, including how to opt out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/) (NAI) and [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) (DAA). If you are located in the European Union, you may opt out of many ad networks by visiting [http://www.youronlinechoices.eu.](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)

Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your opt out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on the NAI and DAA websites accessible by the above links.

_**With Whom Do We Share Information that We Collect on our Site?**_

We may provide the aforementioned third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site. We do not share your personal information collected on our Site, such as name or email address, or other personal information with these third parties. These third parties may collect IP address and related site usage data; however we don’t permit them to collect your name, contact information or other personally identifiable information through our Site.

Marchex may share non-personal information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. Such non-personally identifiable information may include, for example, your IP address, pages(s) you visited and keyword searches you conducted on our Site. This information may allow such third parties to provide you customized advertising.

In addition, Marchex may partner with other parties in connection with the various services offered on our Site, such as credit card processors or email delivery services. In such instances, we may share limited personal information that is necessary for the third party to provide its services. These companies are only permitted to use this information on our behalf.

Marchex may also provide personal information when disclosure may be required by law (e.g., subpoenas, search warrants and court orders), to enforce the terms of our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, and as evidence in litigation in which we are involved. We may also determine that such action is reasonably necessary to protect our or another party’s rights, property, or well-being. This action may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud detection or protection, or in other situations involving suspicious or illegal activities.

In the event of a transfer of ownership of Marchex, such as acquisition by or merger with another company, or in the case of bankruptcy, a user’s information (as well as any other information we collect via our Site or the Analytics Services) may be transferred to the acquiring company.

_**_Marchex Call Analytics and Online Advertising Services_**_

Marchex provides call analytics services and related online and mobile advertising services to its business customers and clients (“Clients”). As part of these analytics services, Marchex:

  * Provides click-to-call and view-to-call analytics services to Clients, helping Clients track and evaluate advertising performance by measuring and analyzing actual calls delivered from online and mobile ad campaigns or via certain websites.
  * Helps Clients drive calls through targeted ad campaigns on third-party sites and provides related analytics services.
  * Provides call recording and other analytics services to its Clients related to their inbound calls.



_**Information Collected and Used in Provision of Our Analytics Services**_

In providing our services to Clients, we collect online usage and analytics information across third-party websites. We may link this information with other information we collect from third parties, as well as information we collect offline.

The types of information we collect in providing our analytics services online includes IP address, a date and time stamp, device ID, cookie ID, URL and referring URL, browser type, advertising identifiers, header information, and other information about the ad or web page the user was viewing. We collect this information automatically via cookies and pixel tags. We may also collect information related to calls placed to our Clients, such as caller ID information of the caller, and may link this information to the online activity we have collected, as well as information collected from third parties.

Sometimes we may collect sensitive information as part of providing services to our Clients. Sensitive information includes information or an opinion (that is also personal information) about an individual’s health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, philosophical beliefs, criminal record and sexual orientation, amongst other things. We will not use sensitive information for a secondary purpose, unless you would reasonably expect the information to be used for the secondary purpose, and that secondary purpose is directly related to the primary purpose of collection.

Marchex uses this information to provide call analytics, advertising and performance measurement services on behalf of Clients, and to provide Clients with reports and metrics about the success of their advertising campaigns.

_**Opt Out**_

If you would like to opt out of our online call analytics services, you may do so by clicking [here](http://px.marchex.io/OptOut.html) to obtain the Marchex opt-out cookie.

If you opt out of the Marchex online Analytics Services, it tells our servers not to link the fact that you viewed a particular ad to the fact that you placed a call to a Client; we will still count you when compiling aggregate information about ad views, such as number of impressions. Further, opting out of our online analytics services will not opt you out of Marchex call recording and offline call analytics services provided to Clients.

If your browser is configured to reject cookies when you visit the opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your opt-out will no longer be effective.

_**Safe Harbor**_

With respect to the personal data received from the European Union and Switzerland related to the Marchex Call Analytics and related services, Marchex complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor framework and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
