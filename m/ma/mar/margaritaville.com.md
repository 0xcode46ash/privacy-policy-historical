### 6\. How We Share Your Information With Third Parties

From time to time, we may share the information we collect about you with our service providers, partners, affiliates, and third-party advertisers, if any.

Service Providers: We may use other companies or individuals ("Service Providers") to provide certain services to us or on our behalf, such as operating and supporting the Site and its services, analyzing data, or performing marketing or consulting services. For example, we may use outside shipping companies to ship orders and outside credit card processing companies to bill for goods and services. We do not authorize these Service Providers to use your information for any purpose outside the services related to the Site or the purpose for which the applicable Service Provider was engaged by us.

These Service Providers (such as companies used to process shipping orders and credit card payments) may, in turn, provide us with similar information about you that may help us create your personalized user profile as well as other service enhancing features that we implement from time to time. 

Marketing Partners and Third-Party Advertisers: From time to time, we may share information about you with our affiliates, partners, or other third-party companies to provide relevant advertising and marketing communications. If you sign up for specific services that are provided by us and a partner, affiliate, or other third-party company, we may share information you provide to us with these third parties. For example, our sweepstakes and other promotional offers may be partnered with or co-sponsored by another company, and if you enter the sweepstakes or sign up for the offer, your information may be collected by that other company.

If you do not wish to receive these communications, please refer to our opt-out process in Section 11. 

To Comply With Legal Process Or Protect Rights: There may be instances when we will need to disclose your information to: (i) protect or defend our legal rights, including without limitation, those of our employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety of users of the Site or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process, including subpoenas served on us.
