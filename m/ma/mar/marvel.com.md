**Marvel's Privacy Policy**

**PRIVACY**

It is Marvel's policy to respect and protect the privacy of visitors to Marvel's web sites. Accordingly, Marvel DOES NOT extract personal information about you or your computer at any time on Marvel's web sites without your permission. Marvel will, however, analyze information about our users as a group to make our web sites better. Users are not individually identified when we do this. 

Marvel will collect personal information such as names, home addresses, e-mail addresses, age, etc., but only when you voluntarily give it to us when you order subscriptions, the Marvel newsletters, enter contests or sweepstakes, or register with the site. This information is also used internally by Marvel for fulfilling your requests, marketing and research purposes. Marvel will NOT sell, rent or give your personal information to any third party unless we ask for and receive your permission at the time the personal information is collected from you. Marvel does however, share aggregate information about the users of Marvel's web sites with our advertisers, business partners, sponsors and certain others. As mentioned above, this aggregate information is used to develop, improve and customize Marvel's web sites to better serve our users. 

If you're under thirteen (13) years old, you should not be submitting any personal information like your name, address, e-mail address, phone number etc., without your parents' permission. You will notice that when we have pages which ask for personal information we include reminders asking kids to get parental permission before submitting. 

We may occasionally ask, on a voluntary basis and with prior parental permission, if appropriate, for personal information to provide to sponsors of particular activities and/or products. This will be made clear in each individual case where we have third-party sponsors and you will have the opportunity to participate in these activities even if you choose not to give permission to Marvel to share this information with our sponsors. 

Marvel uses automated e-mail systems to e-mail weekly newsletters and to collect and answer correspondence from our users. While Marvel may not have the time or manpower to individually answer each piece of correspondence, we do read all of them! 

Marvel tries to make it easy for you to contact us and we provide easy instructions [Geoff should add detail once he gets this worked out] on how you can either edit information previously given (such as your address) or remove yourself from automated messages generated by Marvel each time we send you an automated message. Please contact help@marvel.com with technical problems only. 

**COOKIES**

Marvel on occasion uses "cookie" technology to enhance your online experience by making it easier for you to navigate through our web site or to make an activity work better. 

Cookies are small pieces of information or files that a web site puts on your hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow your computer to "remember" information from our web site for future use. When cookies are used, Marvel DOES NOT extract individual information about you during this process. The use of cookies is an industry standard-in other words, cookies are used by most major web sites. 

Marvel uses information collected by cookies to learn about our users' preferences, so that we can make our web sites better. The information is about our users as a whole, not about individuals. 

**LINKS**

We try to make sure that when there are links off our site, they are working and lead you to interesting, fun and informative areas. But it's hard to guarantee what exactly is presented on other sites or where links elsewhere may lead to. Marvel is not responsible for the content or information provided or requested by these links. Marvel strongly recommends that kids check with an adult before surfing new sites. 

**SECURITY**

Marvel exercises great care and implements a variety of technologies to make Marvel web sites as secure as possible against unauthorized access and to protect the information you choose to provide to us. We periodically review and update these measures. 

In compliance with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), we're sensitive about children consulting with parents or guardians before furnishing personal information or ordering anything online. We try to remind kids about this and we encourage parents to supervise and join their children in exploring cyberspace. We're proud of our web site, believe that it is suitable for Marvel fans of all ages and hope you enjoy it too. 

The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our Guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Marvel can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once Marvel receives your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. Accordingly, if credit card information is transmitted to us we will use the industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.
