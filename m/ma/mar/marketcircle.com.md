## Privacy Policy

Our online store uses FastSpring for credit card processing. Their servers support up to 128-bit encryption (to the limit of your web browser).

When purchasing from our online store, FastSpring will request various personal information, such as name and credit card number. Neither Marketcircle nor FastSpring give or sell your personal contact information to anyone and we do not have access to the credit card number used. We do store which type of credit card was used, should that be needed for purposes of a refund.

We won’t sell or give your email address to anyone, nor do we put you on any mailing lists unless you request to be kept updated.

We take our responsibility to protect the confidentiality of your personal information very seriously.
