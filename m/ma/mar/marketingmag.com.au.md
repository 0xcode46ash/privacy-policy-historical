# Privacy Policy

> **Privacy Policy Statement**   
>  **Niche Media Pty Ltd Internet Privacy Policy**   
>  Niche Media understands that you may have concerns regarding the privacy and security of the personal information you provide to us via our web sites. To demonstrate our commitment to preserving your privacy and to the prevention of any misuse of your personal information we have developed the following policy. **Collecting Information**   
>  The personal information collected on Niche Media's internet web sites is not used to send unsolicited emails, nor is it sold or passed on to third parties. Any contact details and personal information you provide to Niche Media web sites will be used exclusively for the purposes clearly stated on the form or web site where a request for such information is made. As a safeguard, and to ensure that you have read and understood these purposes, you will be asked to consent to this usage before submitting your details. Should you later change your mind, you can opt out of this agreement by contacting Niche Media via one of the address channels provided in the "Contact us" section below. **Storing and Securing Information**   
>  All personal information registered on Niche Media web sites is collected and maintained solely by Niche Media's parent company Waivcom Worldwide Limited, unless specifically stated at the point of collection. Every effort will be made to maintain your information in a secure environment by Waivcom Worldwide. Only authorised employees have access to our user information databases and strict rules apply to their management to guard against loss, misuse or alteration of data. **Credit Card Transactions**   
>  All payment transactions are routed through SSL (Secure Socket Layers). This system does not retain your credit card number once the authorised transaction has taken place. **Cookies**   
>  Niche Media web sites use cookie technology. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a web site to the hard drive of your computer. This enables us to identify your browser and track your activities on the web site. The information collected tells us how often a particular web page has been visited and how many clicks an advertisement has received. Cookies do not, however, reveal any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name and address. As they are simply text files, cookies are incapable of running on your computer, searching your computer for other information or transmitting any information to anyone. The use of cookies is now an industry standard and you will find them on most major web sites. You can disable cookies by changing the settings in your browser preferences. If you disable cookies some site features may not be available and/or may produce unexpected results. **Advertisements and Links**   
>  Although we do not share any of your personal information with third parties, we would like to point out that most of the advertisements on our sites contain direct links to the advertisers' web sites. Clicking on an advertising "banner" or "button" will automatically transfer you to another web site, which will probably transmit its own cookie to your computer. Once you have linked to a site outside the Niche Media network, any personal information you choose to provide will not be covered by our privacy policy. The storage and use of this information will then be subject to this web site's own privacy policy, which we advise you to read prior to submitting any personal details. **Contact Us**
