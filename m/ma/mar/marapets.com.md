**Privacy Policy**

To ensure this website is a safe and fun place for all we ensure that all online information is secure at all times. The site has a large number of online child players and therefore we take care to make sure that the content of the site is always safe for them. 

Children under the age of 13 do not have to disclose any personal information about themselves. They are only asked of their valid email address. This is not viewable by anyone and is only used for them to keep their account on the site secure. If their password has been forgotten they can easily have it emailed to them. Other non-indentifying information is gender, age and country they are located. All information can be removed as requested at any time. 

Marapets asks users 13 years and older to provide a valid first (and optional last name), valid e-mail address, birth date, gender, and country of location. All users can change or remove their information upon registration. 

Children under 13 can have their accounts changed to an over 13 account upon request. They would have to agree that they have shown their parents and asked permission. This would give access to areas such as Clubs, Maramail and Forums. 

When visitors enter the site and members sign up to the site information such as computer operating system, IP address and web browser. This is only for research purposes to ensure that the site works its best with all users. 

Finally, the site requires "Session" Cookies to ensure that the game works. These are small text files that are stored on your computer. They keep you logged onto the site by telling our server who you are and what page of the site you last view. It also helps us to determine how many users and guests are online. These cookies can be easily removed using the appropriate options on your web browser.
