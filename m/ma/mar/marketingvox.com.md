Watershed Publishing Privacy Policy

We are as mad at spam as you are. We get tons of it ourselves and wouldn't even imagine adding to this constant barrage of unsolicited bulk email. So our privacy policy is quite simple: we won't use your e-mail address for any other purpose than the one you originally gave it to us for, which is sending you our online marketing newsletters and discussion lists. 

## Your name and e-mail address

  

* We won't rent, swap or sell our lists with advertisers, other web sites or list brokers. We may engage in co-registration deals with other publishers, provided these partnerships are based on opt-in (i.e. you won't get anything from our partners unless you actively choose to).   

* We consider our lists a business asset and we reserve the right to sell them if someone was to acquire Watershed Publishing (the publisher of MarketingVOX News). Any potential acquirer would have to commit to respecting this privacy policy and change it only with your active consent, before we'd agree to selling them our lists. 

## Double opt-in and opt-out

  

* We strictly use confirmed opt-in (aka double opt-in) so that only the legitimate owner of an e-mail account can subscribe.   

* We make it easy for you to manage your subscriptions, update your personal data, or unsubscribe. Inertia is a nice business helper, but we're not interested in keeping you subscribed against your will. The primary way to unsubscribe is by clicking on automatic links generated at the bottom of each email newsletter.   

* If you use our "send story to a friend" feature, we won't use your friends' email for any other purpose. In fact we "fire and forget" and don't collect these e-mails.   

* If you post a comment on our site, we won't use your email except to send you update notices about the specific entry you commented, or to initiate a private one-to-one email conversation with you about your post. 

## Logging, Cookies, Web beacons and Third Party Advertising

  

* We collect anonymous usage data (technically known as "referrer logs") on our web site, such as IP address, referrer site, or browser type. We do not link IP data to personal identification information except for logged-on members to prevent account sharing fraud.   

* We may use technical tracking means such as cookies or web beacons (single-pixel transparent gifs). These techniques are anonymous and used for statistical purposes only (e.g. email open rate), we won't try to monitor your anonymous personal usage of our site and letters. You can set up your browser to refuse cookies if you want to, though that might limit some site features.   

* We may use an outside advertising company to display advertisements on our website. Advertisements served from third parties may or may not contain cookies. 

## Security

  
We have put security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control, including daily backups of all data. Only authorized personnel are allowed physical and/or digital access to servers and data. All servers and data backups are kept secure from physical and electronic intrusion by use of firewalls and redundant security systems, which are constantly being evaluated and upgraded. 

## Legal Disclaimer

  
Personally Identifiable Information provided to Watershed Publishing is subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants or orders. We make every effort possible to preserve user privacy and anonymity; however, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein such action is necessary to comply with judicial proceedings, court orders or legal processes served on our Website.
