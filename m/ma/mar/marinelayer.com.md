# PRIVACY POLICY - Marinelayer

The abridged version is that we collect as little information from you as possible and do not share it with any third-party sources. That’s not how we roll. The more “professional” and detailed policy is as follows:

For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes no information regarding the domain or e-mail address.

With respect to cookies: We use cookies to record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart.

If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by sending us e-mail at the address listed below.

If you supply us with your postal address on-line you will only receive the information for which you provided us your address.

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers on-line will only receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed on-line.

With respect to Ad Servers: We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies.

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.
