# PRIVACY POLICY – Marine Layer

The abridged version is that we take your privacy seriously. The more “professional” and detailed policy is as follows:

We only collect personal information that we consider necessary for delivering an awesome, safe and customized shopping experience.

Marine Layer will never rent or sell your e-mail address. We do not share credit card information with third parties except for the purpose of processing your order payment and as required by law.

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers on-line will only receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed on-line.

We use cookies to monitor the navigational patterns our customers take on our site. We also place advertising cookies to provide you with enhanced online display advertising tailored to your interests. If you do not want to receive targeted ads, you can visit this page to opt out of AdRoll’s targeted advertising.

We may make your name and postal address available to other direct marketing companies who may have offers of interest to you. If do not wish to receive such mailings, or if you would like to opt out of Marine Layer’s e-mails or catalogs, please visit [www.marinelayer.com/unsub](https://www.marinelayer.com/pages/unsubscribe).

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.
