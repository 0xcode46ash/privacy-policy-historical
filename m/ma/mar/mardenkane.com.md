# Privacy Policy | Marden-Kane

Marden-Kane, Inc. has created this statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website, www.mardenkane.com and for our company in serving our clients.

Visitors to our site have the option of giving us contact information and other personally identifiable information, such as their name and email address. This information is used by us to provide information, via email and regular mail that we believe may be useful to our visitors when requested. Contact information is not shared, rented or sold to any third parties.

In addition, we collect consumers’ personally identifiable information on behalf of our clients when we administer their promotions and maintain it in separate data files for the applicable client. Consumers provide this information in a variety of methods, depending on the particular promotion. We only use this personally identifiable information to operate the sweepstakes or other promotion for our client, in order to select winners, award other prizes or bonuses or for the other purposes of the promotion. We do not use the information for any other purpose. We maintain the information only for so long as necessary to verify and conduct the promotion and to provide redundancy for our clients. We do not provide this information to any entity other than our client and others involved in the operation of the promotion. Our clients’ privacy policies govern the use of these data and they remain their property. Any exceptions to these procedures will be announced in the promotion for which the change is made.

We also collect certain information, not personally identifiable, in connection with administration of promotions. This information generally may include an IP address, cookie data, or computer configuration, for participants in a promotion. This enables us to safeguard the promotion and diagnose problems in the operation of a promotion. Each browser has a function which enables the user to disable cookies if so desired, but in that case, the participant may not be able to participate fully in a promotion.

This site may at times contain links to other sites. www.mardenkane.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

We maintain commercially reasonable security measures in place at our server hosting facility to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

If you have provided us with contact information or other personally identifiable information and do not want to receive e-mail from Marden-Kane in the future and wish to delete such information, please let us know by sending an e-mail to [expert@mardenkane.com](mailto:expert@mardenkane.com) with “Remove from List” written in the subject line, or you may mail us your request to the address below.

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will contact you before we use your data for these new purposes to notify you of the policy change and to provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. The changes will also be noted in revisions to this privacy policy.

 **We abide by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). We will not knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide to us any personally identifiable information without parental consent. Children under 13 years of age are required to obtain the express permission of a parent or guardian before submitting any personally identifiable information about themselves to us. A parent or guardian of a child under 13 may contact us at the address below to delete or modify any personally identifiable information as the parent or guardian wishes.**

Upon request you may view and have inaccuracies corrected in contact information or other personally identifiable information, by sending us an e-mail to [expert@mardenkane.com](mailto:expert@mardenkane.com) with “Contact Correction” written in the subject line and the correct information written in the body of the email, or you may mail us your request to the address below.
