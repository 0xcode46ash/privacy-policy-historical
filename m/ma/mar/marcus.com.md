**1. GENERAL**

This privacy policy describes the types of information we may collect about you; the purposes for which we use the information; the circumstances in which we may share the information; the steps that we take to safeguard the information and to protect your privacy; and our do not call policy (as updated from time-to-time, this **“Privacy Policy”** ). 

This Privacy Policy applies to the Marcus by Goldman Sachs website ([www.marcus.com](http://www.marcus.com/)) and any associated websites, products, services or mobile applications (collectively, the “ **Site** ”). 

As used throughout this Privacy Policy, the terms (1) “ **Goldman Sachs** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **us** ” or “ **our** ” means Goldman Sachs Bank USA and its affiliates, agents and assigns worldwide; (2) “ **you** ” or “ **your** ” means any user of the Site; (3) " **Products** ” means the loans, financial education materials and any other products or services provided through the Site; and (4) “ **includes** ” or “ **including** ” means “including but not limited to” or “includes but is not limited to”.

When you use the Site, we may obtain personal information about you. Obtaining this information is important to our ability to deliver the highest level of service to you, but we also recognize that you expect us to treat this information appropriately.

BY USING THE SITE, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOU ARE CONSENTING TO OUR COLLECTION, USE, DISCLOSURE AND PROTECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE. WE MAY MAKE CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY FROM TIME-TO-TIME. WHEN WE DO, WE WILL LET YOU KNOW BY POSTING THE REVISED POLICY ON THIS PAGE WITH A NEW "LAST MODIFIED" DATE. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SITE FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF ANY CHANGES WILL MEAN THAT YOU ACCEPT THOSE CHANGES.

We may make third-party applications (such as content linking or sharing facilities) available on the Site. Information collected by providers of such applications is governed by their privacy policies.

**2. SOURCES OF INFORMATION**

The personal information we collect about you comes primarily from the information that you provide to us during the course of your relationship with us. We may also collect information about your transactions and experiences with us relating to your use of the Site and/or the Products. In addition, depending on the Products that we provide to you, we may obtain additional information about you from third parties (for example, we may obtain your credit history from consumer reporting agencies or demographic information maintained by third parties). 

When you interact with the Site on a social media platform, we may collect the personal information that you make available to us relating to that platform, including your account ID or username and other information included in your posts.

Finally, in the provision of Products to you, information may be collected about you indirectly through monitoring or other means (for example, recording of telephone calls, monitoring emails and information collected through your use of the Site).

• Other personal information that you disclose as part of any Product enrollment, loan application or in other communications with us.

Of course, you are not required to supply any of the personal information that we request. However, your failure to do so may result in our being unable to open or maintain an account or to provide Products to you.

If your relationship with us ends, we will continue to treat your personal information, to the extent we retain it, as described in this Privacy Policy.

**4. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHIN GOLDMAN SACHS**

In order to provide efficient and reliable Products and to improve product and service options available to you, more than one entity within Goldman Sachs may be given, or given access to, your personal information.

When we share your personal information in this way, we adhere to all applicable legal requirements regarding the sharing and protection of personal information. Additional information on how your personal information is protected while within Goldman Sachs is provided below, under _“Information Security: How We Protect Your Privacy."_

**5. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES**

We only share your personally identifiable information with third parties as described below. In addition, we may share information that does not specifically and personally identify you, such as aggregated information, device identifiers or other unique identifiers to third parties.  

_We will not sell information that personally identifies you to any third party for their own marketing purposes._

_**Third-Party Service Providers:  **_We may share your personal information with non-affiliated companies that perform support services for us or in connection with any Product that you may receive from us (“ **Third-Party Service Providers** ”). Third-Party Service Providers that assist us are required to protect any non-public personally identifiable information that they receive from us and to use that information only for the purposes that we instruct or for other business purposes as permitted by law.

**_Law Enforcement, Legal Process and Emergency Situations_** : Your personal information may be disclosed to third parties as permitted by, or to comply with, applicable laws and regulations. Examples include responding to a subpoena or similar legal process, protecting against fraud and cooperating with law enforcement or regulatory authorities. We may also disclose your information if we believe it is necessary or appropriate to protect our rights, property or safety or the rights, property or safety of our employees, customers or others, or to enforce our contractual rights.

We may transfer to another entity or its affiliates or service providers some or all information about you in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, acquisition, sale of assets or any line of business, change in ownership control or financing transaction.  

**6. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES **

Like many websites, we use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. We may also use these technologies to record your preferences, track your use of the Site, measure exposure to our online advertisements, monitor traffic, improve the Site and make the Site easier to use. When you visit the Site, your browser may be momentarily directed to the website of an ad server, information security vendor or other Third-Party Service Provider. This re-direction process may not be apparent to you. These third-party websites automatically receive information about your device when this happens, and they may also collect information from your interaction with the Site including computer and connection information, standard web log information and ad information.

We partner with third-party advertising companies who also use these tracking tools to provide advertisements on the Site or other websites. These third parties may use these technologies to collect information about you when you use the Site. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may also use persistent identifiers to track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond the Site. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted content.  

Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. The Site is not built to respond to Do Not Track signals. That means that, even if your browser is set to “Do Not Track,” our information collection and disclosure practices (including the choices that we provide to customers) will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy. You may, however, limit online tracking as described in the ** _Ad Choices_** Section below.

**_Ad Choices:  _**You have choices to limit some tracking mechanisms that collect information when you use the Site. Many web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser’s setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, certain features of the Site may not function properly or may not remain accessible to you. In addition, you may also render some web beacons unusable by rejecting or removing their associated cookies. Note that if you choose to remove cookies, you may remove opt-out cookies that affect your advertising preferences.  

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“ **Google** ”), on the Site. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Site, compile reports on the Site’s activity and provide other services related to Site activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor and any referring website. The Site does not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s privacy policies. To learn more about Google’s partner services and to learn how to opt out of tracking of analytics by Google, click [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). 

Many of the third-party advertisers that place tracking tools on the Site are members of programs that offer you additional choices regarding the collection and use of your information. You can learn more about the options available to limit these third parties’ collection and use of your information by visiting our [opt-out page](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?pid=gs01&aid=gs01&type=marcusbygs) and the websites for the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://youradchoices.com/aboutus.aspx), as well as the webpages for [Facebook’s ad preferences](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads) tool and [privacy policy.](https://www.facebook.com/policy)

Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt-out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings. For more information about how to change these settings for Apple, Android or Windows devices, see:

Apple: [http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4228](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4228)

Android: [http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/)  

Windows: [http://choice.microsoft.com/en-US/opt-out](http://choice.microsoft.com/en-US/opt-out)

Please note that opting-out of advertising networks’ services does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using the Site or on other websites, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs. It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.

**7. INFORMATION SECURITY: HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY**

We are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information. We limit access to your personal information to authorized employees, agents, contractors or vendors. As described above in _Disclosures of Your Personal Information to Third Parties_ , third parties receiving personal information are required to protect any personal information provided to them. We also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the information against loss, misuse, damage or modification and unauthorized access or disclosure while in our possession. 

**8. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION**

**_Users Under Thirteen:  _**The Site is intended only for users over the age of thirteen (13). Accordingly, we will not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children that we know to be under the age of thirteen (13).

**_Users Outside of the United States:  _**If you use the Site outside of the United States, you understand and consent to the transfer of your personal information to, and the collection, processing and storage of your personal information in, the United States and elsewhere. The laws in the United States and these countries regarding personal information may be different than the laws of your state or country.

**9. OTHER PRIVACY POLICIES OR STATEMENTS**

This Privacy Policy provides a general statement of the ways in which we protect your personal information. We may, however, in connection with other specific Products, provide you with privacy notices, disclosures, policies or terms that supplement this Privacy Policy. To the extent that there is a conflict between this Privacy Policy and any privacy notice, disclosure, policies or terms relating to any Product, the privacy notice, disclosure, policies or terms relating to the Product will govern.

**10. DO NOT CALL POLICY**

Goldman Sachs Bank USA (“ **GS Bank** ”) does not place marketing telephone calls to numbers appearing on state or federal do not call lists (unless permitted by applicable law) or to the number of a person who has requested not to receive telemarketing calls made by or on behalf of GS Bank relating to the Products. If you ask not to receive telemarketing calls from us relating to the Products, you will be placed on our do not call list and will not be called during any future telemarketing campaigns relating to the Products. Any request to be placed on our do not call list will be processed within a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 30 days. GS Bank employees involved in GS Bank's telemarketing campaigns receive training on how to use our do not call list, and how to document, process and honor requests to be placed on our do not call list. It is our policy to honor a do not call request for five (5) years from the time the request is made. However, some states have laws that require us to honor such a request for a longer period of time, and it is our policy to comply with those laws when applicable. Subject to applicable law, if you communicate with us by telephone, we may monitor or record the call. We reserve the right to revise this _Do Not Call Policy_ at any time by posting changes to this Privacy Policy.
