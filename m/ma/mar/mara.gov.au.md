## The Privacy Act 

The Privacy Act 1988 is the key law designed to prevent agencies in the Australian Government from misusing personal information they have collected.

The information privacy principles in the Act are strict safeguards. The Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority must obey them when collecting, using and disclosing information about you.

As a general rule, we do not collect personal information when you visit this website. You can visit this website without telling us who you are, unless you choose to provide such information.
