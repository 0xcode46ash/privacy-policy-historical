### Our role

Our key objectives are to ensure that:

  * consumers understand their rights and agents understand their obligations under the regulatory framework;
  * only suitable persons are registered as migration agents, and unsuitable persons are refused registration or re-registration:
  * registered migration agents maintain appropriate knowledge and skills to enable them to provide accurate and timely advice to consumers:
  * registered migration agents are monitored to ensure the integrity of their conduct and the quality of the immigration assistance provided to consumers; and
  * consumers of the services of registered, or formerly registered, migration agents are provided with an efficient and effective complaints handling service.



### Our obligations under the Privacy Act

This privacy policy sets out how we comply with our obligations under the Privacy Act 1988.  The Privacy Act sets out 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) which regulate the collection, use, disclosure and storage of personal information and how individuals can access and correct personal information held about them.  We are legally bound by the APPs.

The Privacy Act defines ‘personal information’ as

information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable:

  1. whether the information or opinion is true or not; and
  2. whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.



The Privacy Act also places a higher standard of protection on sensitive information which means:

Information or an opinion about an individual's:

  * racial or ethnic origin
  * political opinions
  * membership of a political association
  * religious beliefs or affiliations
  * philosophical beliefs
  * membership of a professional or trade association
  * membership of a trade union
  * sexual orientation or practices
  * criminal record
  * health information about an individual
  * genetic information about an individual that is not otherwise health information
  * biometric information that is to be used for the purpose of automated biometric verification or biometric identification
  * biometric templates
