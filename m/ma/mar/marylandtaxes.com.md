Online Privacy Statement

The Comptroller of Maryland respects your privacy and the confidentiality of your tax records. We keep all the information we collect at this site strictly confidential, and we use the latest technology to secure the data on this site.

**What information do we collect?**

Let's start with what we don't collect. We don't collect or capture names; homes, business, or e-mail addresses; telephone numbers; or account information from your Internet visit unless you voluntarily give us that information for a specific application. If you do give us that information, we use it only for the stated purpose. We don't use cookies to track visitors to our web site; however for some of the interactive applications we do use them to hold your session information for that application. Once you finish the application the cookie is removed. 

Our web server software automatically logs the following information every time someone visits our Web site:  **Information** | **Definition**  
---|---  
Date | Date the visit occurred.  
Time | Time the visit occurred.  
Client IP | Internet Protocol address of the visitor.  
Server IP | Internet Protocol address of web server accessed. This will always be the IP address of our web server. We do not and cannot track sites you visit other than our Web site.   
HTTP Status | Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) status or error code.   
HTTP Request URL | Identifies the Web page or file requested.

**What do we do with the information collected?**

We do not and will not sell this information or distribute it to anyone outside the department. 

We use the information we gather from your visit to help us improve our Web site. For example, by tracking how many people visit the Web site, when they visit, and the pages they visit, we can give visitors more of the kind of information they want and need. And by tracking client software (e.g., browser), we can avoid using features that visitors cannot view or use. 

**What laws protect your privacy on our Web site?**

The privacy of all tax information, including any information you submit to our web site or information accessed through our web site (such as the status of your refund) is protected by the Tax General Article of the Maryland Annotated Code, Section 13 - 202. The tax confidentiality law prohibits any state employee from divulging confidential tax information.
