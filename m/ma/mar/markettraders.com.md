We use cookie technology to help members move faster through the site and to keep track of your shopping cart.  We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests.  A cookie is a small file sent to your computer by our site server.  The most commonly employed cookies on our site server are those that help us establish (1) whether you are a registered member of our site, and (2) whether a registered member has opted to use the “auto-login” feature, which eliminates the requirement for registered members to identify themselves each time they visit our site.  A separate cookie from the company that handles our advertising production and tracking system helps identify which ad you may be clicking on, so that you will be linked to the correct site.  We may also use cookie technology to track the site’s aggregate page views, which helps us determine which features the user base seems to be most or least interested in.  Please note that we do not track your individual usage patterns using cookies, nor do we use them to track your financial holdings or other personal preferences in any individually identified way.  Contrary to what you might have heard from other sources, cookies cannot get information from your hard drive against your will, cannot destroy files, and cannot send you viruses.
