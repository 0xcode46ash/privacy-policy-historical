# Privacy Policy | LocalVox

**Privacy Policy**

Protecting your private information is our priority. This Statement of Privacy applies to the LocalVox Media including it’s owned and operated websites at www.localvox.com and www.nearsay.com, and any LocalVox-developed software applications that use those services, and governs data collection and usage. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to LocalVox Media Inc. include www.localvox.com, www.nearsay.com and LocalVox. The LocalVox website is a Business Website site. By using the LocalVox website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

**Collection of your Personal Information**

LocalVox may collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, phone and email address. LocalVox may also collect anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your age and gender. We may gather additional personal or non-personal information in the future.

Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by LocalVox. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the LocalVox website.

Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through LocalVox’s public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others.

LocalVox encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from LocalVox so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. LocalVox is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the LocalVox website.

**Do Not Track  Browser Setting**

Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a single website. For these purposes tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time.

How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, LocalVox does not interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described more fully throughout this Privacy Policy, we limit our use and collection of your personal information.

For a description of Do Not Track protocols for browsers and mobile devices, or simply to learn more about the choices available to you, you can visit the All About Do Not Track website:[http://allaboutdnt.com](http://allaboutdnt.com/)

**Use of your Personal Information**

LocalVox collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and deliver the services you have requested.

LocalVox may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from LocalVox and its affiliates. LocalVox may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

LocalVox does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.

LocalVox may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to LocalVox, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

Personally identifying information may be collected by third party companies that provide services to help us with service operation including, but not limited to website analytics, social sharing and advertising. These third parties are authorized to use your personally identifying information and may use such information over time and across different websites and services beyond LocalVox.

LocalVox may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within LocalVox, in order to determine what LocalVox services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within LocalVox to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

LocalVox will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on LocalVox or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of LocalVox; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of LocalVox, or the public.

**Use of Cookies**

The LocalVox website, and third partners with whom we partner,  may use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize LocalVox pages, or register with LocalVox site or services, a cookie helps LocalVox to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same LocalVox website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the LocalVox features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the LocalVox services or websites you visit.

GeoTrust
