**Markdown.com LLC Privacy Policy**  
Markdown.com LLC is strongly committed to protecting your privacy. The purpose of this document is to inform our users what information we collect and how and why we use information that we collect from people who use the Markdown.com LLC site and/or e-mail alert service. 

The Markdown.com LLC [ Anti-Spam policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20010216191025id_/http%3A//www.markdown.com/antispam.cfm) is incorporated into this privacy policy by reference. 

We will collect your IP address upon entry into our site. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our website. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information.  **Why We Ask For Personal Information**   
When visitors to the Markdown.com LLC web site sign up for an account to start receiving our e-mail alerts, we ask them to tell us a little about themselves. Specifically, we ask for the user's e-mail address via a registration page. We do this so that we can e-mail our Markdown Alerts to subscribers; we feel this is a vital part of our service and thus find it necessary to ask for user e-mails. We request information from you, including your e-mail address and preferences, so that, in the future, we can target our users with the deals that will most likely be of interest to them. We also may use subscribers' e-mails to contact users and provide updates regarding Markdown.com LLC and to send user promotional material and information provided to us by our business partners (this is sent only if the user has told us that this is acceptable during the sign-up phase by "opting-in" to these types of announcements). Users may, at any time, opt out of receiving future mailings by accessing their account or visiting http://www.markdown.com/cancel.cfm. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data for internal analysis and to share with other companies the profile of our customers. Only the user's email address is required information to receive the e-mail alerts. Any additional fields on the registration form are optional and will not affect whether or not you will receive the newsletter (but will affect whether or not you are admitted as a full-member and are eligible to earn credits and share in the revenue of the Company). Finally, we may, and you authorize us to, disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.  **Third-Party Affiliates**   
Markdown.com LLC partners with many companies to help support our free services. The Company will not share or sell to third parties any individual information users provide us. Markdown.com LLC may share non-personal aggregate, or summary, information regarding its subscribers with partners or other third parties. On occassion, we may authorize these third parties to send approved offers to our opt-in subscribers that we feel may be of interest to them. Users may opt-out of receiving these types of announcements during the registration process or at any other time simply by e-mailing Markdown.com LLC at the "suppport@markdown.com" address. In addition, we occassionally send information for advertisers in our own e-mails. We may also share aggregate information with third parties, in order to tell them more about our users. For example, we may tell potential advertisers that 25 percent of our users are between the ages of 18 and 30 (this statistic is an example only, not a real statistic and we occasionally conduct voluntary e-mail surveys of our users to acquire these facts). Users may choose to purchase services from other companies that are publicized through Markdown.com LLC. This privacy policy does not apply to information users give to these other companies. Any information users give to another company is governed by the rules of that company's privacy policy that may be different than Markdown.com's. Markdown.com LLC takes no responsibility for information given to other companies; please review these companies' privacy policies prior to your purchase if you're concerned.  **Cookies**

Cookies received with ads are collected by the advertising company, and we do not have access to this information. Some customer data (in aggregate form only) is shared with the advertising companies.

Each staff member with a need for such information employs their own user ID and password to access the data.
