To further this commitment, we have adopted this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to guide how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us. CLO includes its Affiliates, which shall mean subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership.

The term “Personal Information” as used in this Privacy Policy includes any individually identifiable information about the user, including but not limited to name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or any other identifier of a user, and information concerning that user collected and/or maintained in personally identifiable form. 

BY INSTALLING, USING, REGISTERING TO OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OUR SERVICES, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not install, use, register to or otherwise access our Services. 

We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, without any liability to you. We will notify you of any revisions to this Privacy Policy in accordance with Section 23 of our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/footer/terms). Such modifications shall be effective thirty (30) days after posting unless stated otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will be deemed to have agreed to any such modifications by your further use of our Services after any such modification is posted.

CLO does not sell or rent your Personal Information to third-parties for marketing purposes without your consent. However, you hereby agree that CLO may, without seeking further your consent, share your Personal Information with affiliate companies of CLO to provide you our Services or information about other services and promotional materials. In addition, CLO may share Personal Information with business partners that assist CLO in providing you our Services. CLO is committed to giving you a choice when your Personal Information may be used or disclosed for marketing purposes. 

We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your personally identifiable information by our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners, and is not subject to our control. 

C. Business Transfer 

In a business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, dissolution (including bankruptcy), change of control, or a sale of all or a portion of our assets, customer information, including personally identifiable information, generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event that CLO undergoes such transactions, including preparation of any of such transactions, we may share, disclose or transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor. Any third party to which we transfers or sells our assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.

Children under the age of 13 should not use or attempt to use our Services, and if you are under 13, please do not attempt to use our Services or send any information about yourself to us. 

Further, in the event that CLO receives personal information that CLO discovers was provided by a child under the age of 13, CLO will promptly delete such personal information in a secure manner. Parents, who believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, may submit a request in writing to [inquiries@marvelousdesigner.com](mailto:inquiries@marvelousdesigner.com) that the information be removed.

Parents should oversee their children’s use of e-mail, forum and other online communications. 

#### 5\. SAFEGUARDS

CLO maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of the personal information we collect and store about our account holders. Personal information collected by CLO is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible by authorized employees. In addition, our online store uses industry-standard encryption to prevent unauthorized electronic access to sensitive financial information such as your credit card number. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control (i.e., maintain data quality). Before we allow web users to access their personal information, for example, we verify their identity by requesting that they submit information such as their username and password. We also take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties to whom we transfer personal information provide sufficient protection of such data. 

Your personal information may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the country of your residence. It may also be processed by personnel of our Affiliates and third party service providers who may operate outside the country of your residence. In such case, we will take reasonable steps to require such third party in possession of your personal information to take commercially reasonable security measures to protect the information. 

However, unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, you acknowledge that: (a) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through our Services cannot be guaranteed; and (b) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party

CLO is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites or services. If you are concerned about the privacy policy of a certain third party, we recommend that you read the privacy policy of the site or service to which you link before you submit any personal information. 

#### 7\. ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION

CLO makes good faith efforts to enable you to review, update or correct your personal information in CLO's possession. In order to do so, please contact our Privacy Policy Administrator at [inquiries@marvelousdesigner.com](mailto:inquiries@marvelousdesigner.com). CLO will need sufficient information from you to establish your identity and to verify your access request, and also to assist us in handling your request. Please note that even if personal information is changed or deleted according to your request, CLO may still retain some of your personal information to resolve disputes, enforce CLO user agreement(s), and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of our Services. 

#### 8\. Deactivated or Terminated Account

A request to delete and/or termination of your account will not result in the removal of information collected and already put in aggregate form or information that cannot, in our sole discretion, be removed without undue burden to us. We are not able and/or obligated to remove any of your information from a third party provider or platform. Moreover, please be aware that even after you delete your account or your account is terminated, your information may not be deleted in its entirety from our servers and servers of the third party with whom such information have been shared
