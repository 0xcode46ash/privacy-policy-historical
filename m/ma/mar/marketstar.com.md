Privacy Statement

MARKETSTAR has a strong commitment to protect customers' privacy on all the Web sites it operates. We pledge that as we gather and use information about you, we will do so responsibly. All of our employees are required to safeguard the privacy of information about our customers. This same expectation is made of our partners, contractors and suppliers. 

MARKETSTAR sets high standards for the protection of its' customers' privacy over the Internet. Upon request, MARKETSTAR will share with the customer what information it gathers about them, how that information is collected, who uses it, how it is used, how long it is retained and the options available to control the use of collected information. 

The information collected from users of MARKETSTAR Web sites is used to ensure quality customer service or to comply with state and federal regulations. For example, when an on-line employment application is submitted, that information must be retained to ensure fair hiring practices according to state and federal laws. That information would not be used to generate marketing lists, or shared with persons outside of those directly involved in Human Resource efforts at MARKETSTAR. On other occasions, a user may submit information such as general inquiries, on-line ordering, inquiries for product and service information, establishing a profile for receiving coupons & advertisements, and for contests entry. We may use this information for our own customer contact purposes, e.g., to contact or send materials for marketing purposes, or to inform customers of upcoming events and new products. However, we will take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard the information from unauthorized access, and will not make individually identifiable information that is gathered on our sites available to unaffiliated organizations for commercial purposes unrelated to the business of MARKETSTAR. 

There may be instances where MARKETSTAR generates general statistics about the information provided by the Web site users. This analysis is not specific to any one user and is used for evaluation of the effectiveness of the site. These statistics may be used to understand volumes of usage and to improve areas within the Web site for all our visitors. 

MARKETSTAR, or agents on MARKETSTAR's behalf, will use e-mail to respond to specific questions or issues, or to inform about events or new products. MARKETSTAR will not send commercial solicitation via e-mail to individuals who log on to its Web sites who request it not be sent. If MARKETSTAR should change this policy, this statement will be updated to reflect that change. 

Users may be able to link to non-MARKETSTAR sites from this site. MARKETSTAR is not responsible for the content or privacy practices employed by other sites. MARKETSTAR reserves the right to increase its' information collection capabilities in order to better serve our customer needs. This privacy statement will be updated in the event that MARKETSTAR changes its practices regarding customer information collected via the Web site.

What anonymous information is collected on this site?   
Anonymous clickstream information is collected for every visitor to this site. This includes pages viewed, date & time, and browser type. IP numbers are not stored, but are temporarily used to determine domain type and in some cases, geographic region. There is no association between this information and a visitor's identity. 

How is it used?   
The information is used by MarketStar to build anonymous behavioral profiles which are written to the MarketStar Knowledge database -- securely housed at the MarketStar data center. These profiles are accessed by MarketStar-enabled web sites to offer you personalized content and promotions, and to target relevant, more interesting ads -- all without knowing your identity. Again, there is no association between a MarketStar Knowledge profile and a visitor's identity. For users who prefer not to have their web usage information reflected in MarketStar Knowledge database, MarketStar provides an opt-out procedure. 

For more information   
If you have any questions, concerns or comments, please e-mail [legal@marketstar.com](mailto:legal@marketstar.com).
