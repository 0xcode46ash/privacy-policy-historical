**__Note__** ** _:_** Market Day does not sell, rent or trade consumer mailing lists.

Market Day Corporation is committed to protecting the privacy of consumers of its interactive products and services. Throughout cyberspace, we want to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for consumers, and in particular, ensure that our young people's information is protected.

This privacy policy applies to Market Day’s web sites. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to Market Day’s web sites, what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit these sites, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. Finally, please note that this policy applies only to Market Day’s web sites and not to other companies’ or organizations’ web sites to which we link, including the web site of any merchant, retailer or independent sales consultant.  In addition, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the use or disclosure of information that is collected or obtained by us through means other than through Market Day’s web sites.

**Information About All Market Day’s Online Visitors  
**In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to Market Day’s web sites and each of its areas, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of a site, so we can improve that site to ensure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. We may share this non-personal statistical or aggregated information about our customers with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties.  For example, Market Day’s web sites use a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tell us how and when pages in our sites are visited, and by how many people. Market Day web site cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what your screen name or e-mail address is.   If for any reason you wish to not take advantage of cookies you may have your browser not accept them, although this will prevent you from ordering products from our sites and may disable or render unusable some of the features of Market Day’s web sites.

**Information About You**  
We may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use a service or when you order a product. We need certain information such as your name, billing address and credit card number in order to provide that service or product to you. We do not collect that information for any purpose other than to process your Market Day web site orders unless you “opt-in” to receive promotional information via e-mail from a Market Day web site. 

In case you change your mind or wish to update or delete personal information (such as your zip code), we will endeavor to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us.  You can do this by contacting us at the contact points specified above.

**E-mail Addresses**  
When you register with a Market Day web site, we ask for your e-mail address. This information is used to contact you with questions that we may have about your orders. In addition, you may also “opt-in” and elect to receive promotional information via e-mail from a Market Day web site. For example, if you register with marketday.com your e-mail address will also be provided to the Market Day Chairperson at your school, for the express purpose of enabling the Chairperson to contact you regarding your order or to promote a Market Day sale or other applicable Market Day programs at your school.  You can change your mind and “opt-out” from receiving further materials using the process outlined below.

E-mail addresses may also be collected at times other than registration; for example, in connection with promotions. Certain of Market Day’s web sites may from time to time send promotional information to collected e-mail addresses. If you wish to ”opt-out” from receiving such material, please log-in at www.marketday.com and choose “order online” from the menu at the page bottom, then choose “my account.” You may then select “no” to receive e-mail newsletters. ****

**Disclosure**  
We collect the domain names of visitors to our web sites and the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail; however, we do not disclose information about your individual visits to Market Day’s web sites or information that you may give us, such as your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number, to any non-affiliated companies for their personal use.  Please note that when you follow a link on a Market Day web site to certain suppliers, merchants or retailers, such as via schoolshare.com, Market Day may share with those persons certain non-personal information identifying you as a visitor from the Market Day web sites. 

We may provide your personal information to third party agents we have hired to help us fulfill your order.  For example, in connection with your order, we would need to provide your credit card number to a payment authorization service and your address to a shipping company to deliver your package.   While we use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, Market Day will have no liability for disclosure of any information obtained due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized acts of third parties.

Market Day reserves the right to disclose customer information in special cases, when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other Market Day web site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.  We may disclose personal information without notice to you in response to a subpoena or when we believe in good faith that the law permits it or to respond to an emergency situation.

Specific areas or pages of our web sites may include additional or different provisions relating to collection and disclosure of personal information.  In the event of a conflict between such provisions and this Privacy Policy, such specific terms shall control.

**Special Attention to Kids**  
Market Day takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of young people visiting our web sites. We do not knowingly collect personal information about or from children and believe that children should get their parents’ consent before giving out any information. No information should be submitted to this site by guests under 18 years of age, and guests under 18 years old are not allowed to register for our site or promotions.  We encourage you to participate in your child’s experience in cyberspace and to follow these simple safety tips before your child explores the Internet. 

  1. Don’t give your Internet password to anyone, even your best friend. 
  2. Never tell someone your home address, telephone number, school name or any personal information. 
  3. If someone says something that makes you feel unsafe or funny, take charge! Don’t respond. Tell your parents immediately. 
  4. Never say you’ll meet someone in person. 
  5. Always tell a parent about any threatening or bad language you see online. 
  6. Don’t accept things from strangers (web links, e-mail, files). 



Market Day Corporation recommends that parents use web filtering technology to supervise their children’s access to the web.

**Market Day Web Site Privacy Policy Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy for Market Day’s web sites, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather and how we might use that information.  Please check this policy periodically for changes.  Your use after any change signifies your acceptance of the changed terms. 

Effective Date: 9/10/2004
