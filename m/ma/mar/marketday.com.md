The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to Market Day’s websites, what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit these sites, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information.

information about all market day’s online visitors

Market Day gathers certain web usage information directly and through relationships with online partners. This information helps us manage our Internet business and improve the website experience for our customers. We use web traffic data to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our sites. To do this, we utilize web beacons (a.k.a. clear gifs) and cookies and may also detect and use your internet protocol (IP) address or domain name. The types of information collected include how and when pages on our sites are visited, which products are purchased and how many visitors go to Market Day websites from e-mails we have sent. Cookies also enable the website to remember your user name and password, eliminating the need to re-enter this information each time you visit. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like which pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of promotional offers are most appealing. While we use a marketing company to log some of this information, we control how the data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can “opt-out” of this website analysis tool by clicking [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20120513104946id_/http%3A//www.marketday.com/mdnet/util/cmOptOut.aspx). In addition, if for any reason you do not wish to take advantage of cookies, you may have your browser not accept them. Since cookies are used as part of the online ordering process, if they are disabled on your computer, you will not be able to order products online, and this may also disable some of the features on Market Day’s websites.
