You may also have been directed to this Online Privacy Policy from other websites owned or operated by LexisNexis that have adopted this Online Privacy Policy.

This Online Privacy Policy only applies to information collected through our website and the mobile application. You may have also been directed to this Online Privacy Policy from other websites owned or operated by LexisNexis and/or its affiliates that have adopted this policy. Our website and mobile application are not directed at children under the age of 13.

In addition, our mobile application, with your consent, also may collect information about your current location. Our mobile application may also collect your device's unique identifier and other technical information.

 **II. Cookies**

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our website uses first-party and third-party cookies, however personally identifiable information is not collected through the use of cookies. Cookies are used to track user IDs and passwords, provide tailored content, and determine whether a visitor is unique or whether the visitor has viewed our website before.

While most browsers are set to accept cookies by default, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you before accepting them. Your browser manufacturer has information on changing the default setting for your specific browser. Deleting or refusing to accept cookies from our website, however, may limit your ability to use some portions of our site which require the use of cookies to operate effectively.

 **III. Non-personally identifiable information**

Our website and our mobile application also collect non-personally identifiable information. For example, as you browse our website or use our mobile application we may collect information about your visit, but not about you personally. Via web server logs, for example, we may monitor statistics such as: the number of people that visit our website, which page(s) are visited on our website, from which domain our visitors come (e.g., aol.com, hotmail.com, etc.), and which browsers people use to visit our website (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc.). We also may compile statistics that show the numbers and frequency of visitors to our website or the mobile application. These aggregated statistics may be used internally to improve our website or the mobile application and for product development and marketing purposes generally. The aggregated statistics may also be provided to advertisers and other third parties, but again, the statistics contain no personally identifiable information. We may use an outsourcing program to assist us in analyzing this data to better tailor our website.

The mobile application may collect non-personally identifiable information such as the type of device you are using (Apple® iPhone®, iPad®, or Android™ phone) and the version of mobile operating system that your device is using.

 **Information Use and Consumer Choice**

For example, we use information provided to us to customize your experiences on our website in various ways, such as suggesting news articles or member posts that may be of interest or displaying recent status updates from your connections when you log in to martindale.com Connected. Similarly, your information may be used to enhance the experience of your connections.

We may use information about searches or submissions that users provide to us as part of our customer care functions to contact you in response to your comments or inquiries, as part of the maintenance of your account with us (if you have one), or in order to complete a transaction that you requested. In addition, we may also use this type of information to enhance our products and services or to communicate to you about products and services that may be of interest to you, but we will offer you the opportunity not to receive such communications.

We will only share personally identifiable information that you provide about yourself with these third party application developers with your consent or, in the case of information that you make available to another martindale.com Connected user, if that member consents to the use of a third party application that requires information about you that you have shared in order to work.

Finally, please note that we may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to comply with the law or legal process.
