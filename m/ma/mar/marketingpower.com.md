# American Marketing Association's Privacy Policy

**PRIVACY POLICY**

The American Marketing Association (“AMA”) believes in protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your Personal Information. The AMA website is designed to be a robust portal and collaboration tool which allows for the free flow of information between the AMA, its partners, its members, and visitors to the Site. We acknowledge that you may have privacy and security concerns with respect to the information we collect, use, and disclose to third parties for the purpose of allowing us to offer and provide our products and services to you. To this end, we have developed this Privacy Policy to balance the functionality of the Site with your control over your Personal Information.

Personal information is any combination of information, in the possession of or likely to come into the possession of AMA, that can be used to identify, contact, or locate a discrete individual (“Personal Information”) and will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Any information which cannot be used to identify a discrete individual (such as aggregated statistical information) is not Personal Information.

By using this Site, or providing your Personal Information to the AMA, you hereby consent to the transfer of your Personal Information to the US, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

**PURPOSE FOR COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

AMA collects, uses and discloses your Personal Information in its normal course of business for the following purposes:

  * Establishing and maintaining communications with you;
  * Where you have requested content or services from AMA;
  * Responding to your inquiries about content and other services;
  * Making proposals for future service needs;
  * Allowing our partners, affiliates, and local chapters, to notify you of certain products, services, or events offered by them;
  * Making your resume available to prospective employers;
  * Processing transactions through service providers;
  * Registration for conferences, training, and other events;
  * Meeting legal, security, processing and regulatory requirements;
  * Protecting against fraud, suspicious or other illegal activities; and
  * Compiling statistics for analysis of our sites and our business.



**WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

The information gathered by AMA from this Site falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our Site and (2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through our Site.

**Information voluntarily provided by you**

When using this Site, you may choose to provide us with information to help us serve your needs.  The Personal Information that we collect will depend on how you choose to use this Site.

  * Where you request content



If you request content (such as best practices, research, etc.) or further information from us, we require you to submit your name, e-mail address, the name of your organization, and the country in which you are based so we may send you the material you have requested, and to enable us to identify if you are an existing client of AMA.

Following an inquiry into receiving content or services from us, if you decide to proceed, we will collect Personal Information necessary to proceed with the transaction, such as your name, address, post code, contact telephone number, e-mail address, billing address or payment details, as relevant to the product.  We will use your Personal Information to administer your account, fulfill registrations, etc. and generally manage your relationship with us.

  * Where you register with us and/or join the AMA as a member



If you register with the Site, request a service available on the Site (such as registration for a conference), or become a member of the AMA, we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, country, telephone number and the reason for your communication, as well as information about your position and organization and such other information as is reasonably necessary so that we can provide you with the service or identify what would be of most interest to you.  On the data submission form, we shall indicate by way of an asterisk, which information is optional and which information is mandatory.

Any Personal Information that you send us will be used for the purpose indicated on the Site or in this Privacy Policy.

  * Where you submit content



Finally, if you submit content through our Site, we will ask for your name and e-mail address, so that, if you choose, we can update you by e-mail when others also comment on the content, and also so that we can manage the content in line with our Statement of Ethics.  You should be aware that the information you provide there will be made publically available to AMA employees, members and other users of the Site.

  * Where you submit a Resume



We operate a Career Center that enables you to store your resume in our database. When you create a resume, you have the option of making the resume searchable or non-searchable and confidential or non-confidential. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database product. If you choose to make your resume searchable, then all employers and recruiters who pay for access to our resume database product will have access to your resume. In addition to making your resume searchable or non-searchable, you may designate specific information contained within your resume as confidential. Such confidential information will not be shared with employers and recruiters who search the resume database or to whom you deliver your resume.

We use our best efforts to grant access to the resume database only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, and human resource professionals, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not, without our consent, gain access to this database. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, employers and recruiters who have paid for access to the database, and other parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes by any of such parties while resumes are in the database

**Website Navigational Information**

As you navigate the Site, we may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and web beacons (collectively “Website Navigational Information”). Website Navigational Information includes standard information from your web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on the Site (such as the web pages viewed and the links clicked).

**Advertising**

We use cookies and tracking technologies to help us develop our understanding of your interests and what content and services may be relevant to you. In addition, we have a number of partners who also use cookies and similar technologies to determine what products and services of theirs may be relevant to you.

The major browsers have attempted to implement the draft “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) standard of the World Wide Web Consortium (“W3C”) in their latest releases. As this standard has not been finalized, AMA’s Sites are not compatible with DNT.

For information on all of these categories of cookies, and for more information generally on cookies please refer to www.aboutcookies.org.

  * Web Beacons



The Site may also use web beacons (including web beacons supplied or provided by third parties) alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about users’ usage of the Site and interaction with e-mails from AMA. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Site tied to the web beacon, and a description of a Site tied to the web beacon. We use web beacons to operate and improve the Sites and e-mail communications.   We may use information from web beacons in combination with other data we have about our clients to provide you with information about AMA and our services.  We will conduct this review on an anonymous basis.

  * IP Addresses



When you visit our Sites, AMA collects your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and aggregate non-Personal Information. For example, AMA uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which users navigate the Sites.  IP addresses will be stored in such a way so that you cannot be identified from the IP address.

**DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO OTHERS**

We do not disclose any Personal Information about you to any third parties except as stated in this Privacy Policy, as otherwise permitted by law, or authorized by you.

Third parties to whom we disclose information are required by law and contractual undertakings to keep your Personal Information confidential and secure, and to use and disclose it for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances, in compliance with all applicable legislation, which purposes are as follows:

  * To provide the products and services you have requested from us;
  * To notify you or allow our affiliated companies to notify you of certain products or services offered by our affiliated companies;
  * To process transactions through data processing service providers;
  * If the information is a credit card number, to process credit card payments—through third party payment processing, clearing and settlement systems in association with various banks; and
  * To affiliates and partners with whom we have joint marketing agreements.



If these third parties wish to use your Personal Information for any other purpose, they will have a legal obligation to notify you of this and, where required, to obtain your consent.  Contact us on [e-mail address] for more information on these third parties.

**Affiliate Sharing**

In the normal course of performing services for our clients, Personal Information may be shared within AMA and its affiliates for research and statistical purposes, system administration and crime prevention or detection. When you supply us with information containing third party Personal Information (names, addresses, or other information relating to living individuals), we will hold and use that Personal Information to perform general insurance and other services for you on the understanding that the individuals to whom the Personal Information relates have been informed of the reason(s) for obtaining the Personal Information, the fact that it may be disclosed to third parties such as AMA, and have consented to such disclosure and use.

**Service Providers**

Because a number of the service providers we use are located in the United States, including certain AMA affiliates, your Personal Information may be processed and stored inside the United States, and the U.S. government, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your Personal Information under US laws.

AMA's service suppliers adhere to the same protections regarding the collection, use, and retention of data as we do.

**Business Transactions**

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets. In such transactions, user information, including Personal Information, generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if either AMA itself or substantially all of AMA assets were acquired, your Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets.   Therefore, we may disclose and/or transfer your Personal Information to a third party purchaser in these circumstances

**Other Legally Required Disclosures**

AMA preserves the right to disclose without your prior permission any Personal Information about you or your use of this Site if AMA has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) protect and defend the rights, property or safety of AMA, employees, other users of this Site, or the public; (b) enforce the terms and conditions that apply to use of this Site; (c) as required by a legally valid request from a competent governmental authority; or (d) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties. We may also disclose Personal Information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request

In this Privacy Policy, the purposes identified above and in “Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information” will be referred to as the “Identified Purposes.”

**Public Forums**

This website may make public chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to you from time to time. We impose terms of use regarding content and activity at such public areas. Further, we monitor and/or edit posts to those areas. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding whether to disclose any personal information via such forum.

**CALIFORNIA’S “SHINE THE LIGHT” LAW**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 requires any operator of a website to permit its California-resident customers to request and obtain from the operator a list of what personal information the operator disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes, for the preceding calendar year; and the addresses and names of such third parties. AMA does not share any personal information collected from this site with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

**Text Communications**

**CONSENT**

Your knowledge of and consent to AMA’s collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information is critical. We rely on the following actions by you as indications of your consent to our existing and future Personal Information practices:

  * Your voluntary provision of Personal Information to us directly;
  * Your express consent or acknowledgement contained within a written, verbal or electronic application or claims process; and
  * Your verbal consent solicited by AMA (or our agent) for a specified purpose.



Where AMA relies on consent for the fair and lawful processing of Personal Information, the opportunity to consent will be provided when the Personal Information in question is collected. Your consent may be given through your authorized representative such as a legal guardian, agent or holder of a power of attorney.

Subject to certain legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice, you may withdraw this consent at any time. AMA will inform you of the consequences of withdrawing your consent.  **In some cases, refusing to provide certain Personal Information or withdrawing consent  **for AMA to collect, use or disclose your Personal Information  **could mean that we cannot obtain insurance coverage or other requested products, services or information for you.**

**If you wish to withdraw your consent please refer to the Questions or to Withdraw Consent section below.**

**However** , there are a number of instances where AMA does not require your consent to engage in the processing or disclosure of Personal Information. AMA may not solicit your consent for the processing or transfer of Personal information for the those purposes which have a statutory basis, such as:

  * The transfer or processing is necessary for the performance of a contract between you and AMA (or one of its affiliates);
  * The transfer or processing is necessary for the performance of a contract, concluded in your interest, between AMA (or one of its affiliates) and a third party;
  * The transfer or processing is necessary, or legally required, on important public interest grounds, for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or to protect your vital interests; or
  * The transfer or processing is required by applicable law.



**LIMITING COLLECTION AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

AMA will collect, use, or disclose Personal Information that is necessary for the Identified Purposes or as permitted by law. If we require Personal Information for any other purpose, you will be notified of the new purpose, and subject to your consent (where appropriate), that new purpose will become an Identified Purpose.

AMA will collect Personal Information by fair and lawful means. We will normally retain Personal Information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the Identified Purposes. However, some Personal Information may be retained for longer periods as required by law, contract, or auditing requirements.

**SAFEGUARDS**

We have in place physical, electronic and procedural safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information we maintain. Safeguards will vary depending on the sensitivity, format, location, amount, distribution and storage of the Personal Information. They include physical, technical, and managerial measures to keep Personal Information protected from unauthorized access. Among such safeguards are the encryption of communications via SSL, encryption of information while it is in storage, firewalls, access controls, separation of duties, and similar security protocols. However, due to the nature of the Internet and related technology, we cannot absolutely guarantee the security of Personal Information, and AMA expressly disclaims any such obligation.

**EXTERNAL LINKS**

AMA Sites may include links to other websites whose privacy policies we do not control. Once you leave our servers (you can tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your web browser), use of any Personal Information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the website you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these websites via a link from the website's homepage, you should contact the website directly for more information.

**ACCURACY, ACCOUNTABILITY, OPENNESS AND CUSTOMER ACCESS**

Our knowing about changes to some of your Personal Information (e.g. email address) may be key to effectively communicating with you at your request. If any of your details change you can update us by e-mailing us at contact@AMA.com.  **Please keep us informed of changes to your Personal Information.**

You have the right to access your Personal Information and request rectification of any Personal Information in the file that may be obsolete, incomplete or incorrect. However, to secure your Personal Information, AMA does not provide online access to its customers to view or amend Personal Information in its database.

Your Personal Information may also be stored, and can also be accessed, at the local AMA chapter office with which you are a member. For a complete list of our offices,  _click here_.
