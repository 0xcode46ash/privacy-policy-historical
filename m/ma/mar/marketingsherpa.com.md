# MarketingSherpa Privacy Policy

## Your Guarantee of SPAM-Free Privacy

Here at [www.MarketingSherpa.com](http://www.marketingsherpa.com/) we have a childlike faith in the possibility of a spam-free universe and we're doing our best to make it happen. We won't swap or rent your email address to third parties. We won't send you email blasts you haven't asked for from us either. So you can keep your emailbox free for the really important stuff, like juicy gossip about the guy three doors down the hall. Here are some more details on how safe your info is with us for those Privacy Policy fans among you:

## Your email address 

We only collect and hold your email address in order to send you the newsletters you have requested. You can unsubscribe at any time for any reason with zero tears or recriminations. If you ever have a problem with your subscription, feel free to contact Customer Service at [service@marketingsherpa.com](mailto:service@marketingsherpa.com).

MarketingSherpa does not rent email lists (ever), nor will we share your name with "marketing partners" unless you pro-actively check a box on our site personally requesting that your name be added to a partner's list. These boxes are never pre-checked - you actively have to volunteer to be on any lists!

## CAN-SPAM Compliance

On January 5th we added a new feature to our subscription management page to be CAN-SPAM compliant. Now you can use the form to add your name to our suppression "Promo Do Not Email" list. This is separate from editorial lists, so you can be signed up for newsletters and also stop all promo blasts regarding our products. 

Now, we're working with our affiliates (list owners who send out promotions about MarketingSherpa products to their own separate lists) to figure out how to suppress your name from their lists as well. Please bear with us as we, and the rest of the email industry, figure this thing out. Thanks. 

## Your friend's email address

You may notice throughout this site we offer you the chance to send a friend an article or a note telling them about the site. Feel free to take advantage of these opportunities because your pal is also covered by MarketingSherpa's Spam-Free Privacy policy. 

We will only use your friend's email address in order to send the message you asked us to send. Then they will never ever hear from us again â€¦ unless they voluntarily subscribe to our services!

**Viral marketing gone terribly wrong**  
We recognize that there are some bad (and some just plain stupid) people in this world who may abuse our "send a note to a friend" system to send some email to a person who is NOT a friend and who doesn't want to get email from us. 

Unfortunately this is a built-in danger when you offer people the convenience of forwarding an article to a friend. If someone using our system sends you something you don't want, we apologize unreservedly. 

## Special Reports

In addition to our regular, mostly-weekly, issues we may occasionally send you Special Reports that you may find valuable. These are *always* editorial in nature - they are not advertisements or purely commercial. They are *always* written by our own in-house editorial team. (We won't send you anyone else's content under the guise of our name.)

An example -- we may send you our wrap-up notes right after a big marketing trade show.

**Special offer blasts**  
Again, we will never send you an email blast on behalf of a third party. We also won't send you a blast promotion for one of our own products, unless:

  * You specifically and pro-actively signed up for our SherpaStore Specials newsletter.
  * You purchased a specific product - such as a Buyer's Guide - from us in the past and now a new edition of that exact product has come out. In that case we'll let you know it's come out and offer you a special previous-buyers-only discount.
  * You specifically signed up on one of our sites or survey forms to be notified via email when a new particular product or product type comes out. In that case, your wish is our command.



## Unsubscribing

We really hate sites and ezines that are hard to unsubscribe to. So at MarketingSherpa, we've made it stinkingly easy. Just look for the "Manage Subscriptions" link at the top and bottom of every page of our site. 

That link also helps you change email addresses quickly and easily.

Alternatively, just reply to a newsletter issue with only the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. This will unsubscribe you from that particular newsletter.

## Your snail mail address

We do make our snail mail list - compiled from people who enter our regular Free Book Contests and store buyers - available on the rental market. It's one of the ways we support this site.

However, we pre-approve every mailing so that only offers that make good sense (such as a marketing magazine) are sent to you. Also the price of sending direct postal mail is high enough that spammers aren't tempted. 

We do *not* allow anyone to see your telephone number or email address, nor would we ever allow our postal file to be appended with emails.

If you want your snail mail address off this list, email Customer Service at [service@marketingsherpa.com](mailto:service@marketingsherpa.com) and we'll take care of it. The file is updated quarterly. 

## Questions? Concerns?
