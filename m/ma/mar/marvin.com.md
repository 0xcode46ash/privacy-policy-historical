## 1\. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

Portions of the Site permit users to contact Marvin with requests for information regarding our products and services. These and other portions of the Site require users to provide personally identifiable contact information. In general, Marvin uses the information users provide for the purposes stated at the point of collection. For example, Marvin may use contact information to respond to a user’s request for product information.
