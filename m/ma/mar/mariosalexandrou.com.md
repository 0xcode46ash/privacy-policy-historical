Privacy Policy

Marios Alexandrou has a firm commitment to privacy and your privacy is important to me. This statement discloses the information practices for the MariosAlexandrou.com web sites, including what type of information is collected, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. 

Summary   
In general, you can visit this site without telling me who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. I make no effort to identify public users of this site. 

However, some sections of this sites are intended to be used only by a particular visitor or group of visitors and to be hidden to others. Before allowing a visitor access to such restricted sections, I authenticate the visitor by asking the visitor to specify a password. I am then able to track usage of restricted sections by such authenticated users; however, currently I do not attempt to analyze what resources a particular authenticated user accesses. 

I do not disclose any identifying data to any third party for any purpose. 

What information I collect   
When you browse through this sites your browser issues HTTP requests for web pages and other resources from my web servers. I collect certain information contained in the HTTP requests, including: 

  * originating IP address
  * referring web page
  * user-agent information

In general, I do not require users to identify themselves and I do not log the specific identity of visitors. However, to gain access to restricted sections of our sites a visitor is required to provide password information. 

How I use cookies   
I may use cookies to identify sessions when visitors are browsing this site. By using anonymous session cookies I am able to keep users separate from each other and to distinguish separate connections to my web servers. This allows me to analyze trends and statistics about flow of traffic and visitor activities on my site. A session cookie contains a unique value that identifies a particular session, but contains no personal identifying values or information. Session cookies are automatically deleted when the visitor ends a session by closing the browser and are not stored permanently on the visitor's computer. 

I may use a cookie to detect if a visitor has visited my site before, and if so, to help me better publish content that visitors need and want. Such a cookie contains no personal identifying values or information. If accepted by the visitor, the cookie will be stored on the visitor's computer. 

Some sections of my site are intended to be used only by a particular visitor or group of visitors and to be hidden to others. Before allowing a visitor access to such restricted sections, I authenticate the visitor by asking the visitor to specify a password. If the visitor is successfully authenticated I may use a cookie to avoid further authentication of the visitor during the session. Such a cookie may contain a value relating the visitor to the password specified, and even though I am able then to track usage of restricted sections by authenticated users, I currently do not attempt to analyze what resources a particular authenticated user accesses. The cookie is automatically deleted when the visitor ends a session by closing the browser and is not stored permanently on the visitor's computer. 

Why I collect information and how I use it   
I collect the information mentioned above for web site administration purposes, including: 

  * to make sure I deliver the information you request
  * to make sure I deliver the information you request in an expedient manner
  * to make sure I deliver the information you request in a format that is usable to you and your browser
  * to make sure only authenticated users can access restricted sections of my site
  * to be able to improve my sites
  * to make sure other web sites link to our sites in a proper manner
  * for security purposes
