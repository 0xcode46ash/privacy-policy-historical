## A) ThoughtWorks' commitment to privacy

This website is administered by ThoughtWorks, Inc. ("ThoughtWorks US") and its affiliated companies (collectively “ThoughtWorks” or “we”). ThoughtWorks wants you to feel secure when visiting our website or using our services, and is committed to maintaining your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to data collected by ThoughtWorks through its website [www.thoughtworks.com](http://www.thoughtworks.com/) or by other means during the course of its business. Please read this ThoughtWorks Privacy Policy very carefully.

## B) Why ThoughtWorks collects personal information

During the course of carrying out our business and performing our services, ThoughtWorks collect personal information in order to conduct our business, to provide and market our services, and to meet our legal obligations. Sometimes, our clients may also require us to collect information on their behalf in connection with their services or products to you. We may also collect data for other purposes, which we would describe in more detail to you at the point we collect the information. 

You may refuse to provide us with some or all of your personal information; however, this may limit the ways in which we can interact with you, including providing you with our services.

## C) The kinds of information we collect

We usually collect the following kinds of personal information:

  * Name, address, occupation, and contact information (if it is for IT project research purposes, we may anonymise the information upon your request if it is practical to do so);  

  * Interests in our services or events, or that of our clients;  

  * Information about people’s dealings with us or our clients; and  

  * Your opinion or comments on certain matters (e.g., process, systems and IT services).  




## D) How information is collected

ThoughtWorks gathers information in two ways:

  * Indirectly (through our site's technology or through other third parties who collect information on our behalf or have the right to share your information with us); and  

  * Directly (when you provide information to us by way of paper or online forms or questionnaires filled out by you, face-to-face meetings, interviews, business cards or telephone conversations).  




One example of information we collect indirectly is information collected through our Internet access logs. When you access our website, your Internet address is automatically collected and is placed in our Internet access logs. We may also record the URLs of the websites and pages you visit (before, during and after your visit to any ThoughtWorks website), the times and dates of such visits, information about the computer hardware and software you use and other information that may be available.

Additionally, we may collect information from you through the use of cookies. Cookies and their use on our website are explained in greater detail in the Tracking Technologies section in this policy.

We also collect information directly when you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, we may provide the opportunity to sign up for a periodic email newsletter by entering your email address. It is completely up to you whether or not you want to provide it. Additionally, we collect personal information when you apply online for a job opening at ThoughtWorks.

## E) How does ThoughtWorks use this information?

We hold, use and may disclose your personal information for the purposes as set out in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection. We generally use and disclose your personal information for the following purposes:

  * to provide our services to you or our clients  

  * to manage our relationships with you or our clients  

  * to improve ThoughtWorks or its client’s services  

  * to provide professional advice to our clients relating to the performance of IT system and procedures  

  * to review and assess your job applications  

  * to answer your inquiry  

  * to direct-market products and services, advise you of news and industry updates, trends and events  

  * to share with trusted third parties (e.g., our contracted service providers or advisers) whom we have engaged to provide services to you or help us meet our contractual or legal obligations.   




## F) Sending information overseas and sharing information with other parties

By submitting your information to ThoughtWorks website or any of our products or services, you expressly agree to such transfer in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

We will respect and protect your privacy as set out in this Privacy Policy. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. And won’t sell individual information. You agree ThoughtWorks may share your personal information with non-ThoughtWorks parties with your consent (express, constructive of implied), or as required by law such as to comply with subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect ThoughtWorks, its customers, the public, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. You agree that ThoughtWorks may share your personal information with organizations or persons that help us fulfill our obligations or provide our services to you. ThoughtWorks will make efforts to ensure these parties have appropriate measures in place to protect your information and meet our obligations under the applicable privacy rules.

## G) How does ThoughtWorks protect sensitive personal information?

Other than the information you provide when you apply for an employment position at ThoughtWorks, we do not generally seek to collect sensitive personal information through this site); therefore, we advise you not to provide any unsolicited sensitive personal information.
