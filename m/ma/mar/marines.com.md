  **Privacy Policy:**    
At marines.com (the “Website”) we, the United States Marine Corps Recruiting Command (“we”, “us”, “our”) take your privacy very seriously. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how we intend to use any information you provide to us through the Website. **By using or accessing the Website, you signify your consent to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the collection, use and sharing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy you are not authorized to access or otherwise use this site.**

  Pursuant to [Section 503 of Title 10], United States Code, the information requested on this Website may only be used for tools on our site, such as the workbook, to share content on the site or to identify individuals interested in serving with the Marine Corps. Disclosure is voluntary, although declining to provide information will prevent users from accessing tools such as the workbook or to share content. Requesting more information from the Marine Corps may result in you being contacted by a recruiter. Declining to provide information may result in not being contacted by a recruiter, although you may receive recruiting direct mail packages in the future. 

  **Protection for Children:**    
**This Website is not intended for, and we have no intention of collecting personally identifiable information from, children under the age of 13.** If a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, that child’s parent or legal guardian should contact us at Website Action Officer, PO Box 15124, White Bear Lake, MN 55155-5124, if they would like the information submitted by the child deleted from the Website. We will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from its database. If you are age 17 or younger, you are not authorized to submit any content or information to this Website without the explicit consent of your parent or legal guardian.  

  **Non-Personally Identifiable Information:**    
For management of the Website, certain non-personally identifiable information (“Non-Personally Identifiable Data”) is collected by us, through the standard operation of our web servers and through use of “cookies” (described more fully below), for statistical purposes, including, without limitation, for market research activities. This Website uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest to the Website visitors, determining optimal technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas so that we can work on improving such areas of the Website. We also use Non-Personally Identifiable Data collected by us to improve and enhance our users’ experience on the Website. For example, we may share Non-Personally Identifiable Data with unaffiliated third parties, such as business partners, manufacturers, distributors and retailers, in an aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the shared information will not contain nor be linked to any user’s PII (defined below).  

  For Website security purposes and to ensure that this Website remains available to all users, this Website employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change user information, or otherwise cause damage. 

  Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits, unless you request more information from the Marine Corps. Except as set forth above, raw data logs are used for no other purposes than authorized law enforcement activities, and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration General Schedule 20. 

  For purposes of evaluating site navigation, cookies are used in a limited manner. Cookies are pieces of information that a Website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Website more useful by storing information about your Website preferences. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many websites use them to provide useful features to their users. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Website if you do so. 

  **Personally Identifiable Information**    
Participation in the Website features: “Workbook/My Favorites,” “Contact Us,” and “Share It” (collectively, the “Interactive Features”) is totally voluntary. You are under no obligation to provide any information and/or personal data to Marines.com. However, in order to utilize some of the services or features offered by the Websites, including but not limited to, the Interactive Features, you may be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information (“PII”) about yourself. PII can include, without limitation, your name, address, e-mail address, rank, unit, and service information. You may also be asked to submit PII about other users. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send a link to a page on Marines.com, or to send a custom MyPath. You are not authorized to submit any such PII of another user unless you have consent from such user to submit such PII to us. You hereby represent and warrant that you have the necessary authorization to submit any such PII about any such other user.  

  Unless disclosed otherwise on the Website at the time of collection, we do not share any PII you submit through the Website with any unaffiliated third party, unless it is necessary to respond to your inquiry, or to comply with applicable law. Agents and contractors who have access to PII are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for the United States Marine Corps.  

  Please note that we reserve the right to access and/or disclose all PII and non-personal information we gather as required by courts or administrative agencies and to the extent required to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment, or other violations of any law, rule, or regulation, the Website rules or policies, or the rights of third parties, or to investigate any suspected conduct which we deem improper.
