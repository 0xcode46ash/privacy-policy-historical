# SmartViper.com Policy


    INFORMATION COLLECTION AND PRIVACY POLICY. 
    
    
    
    This information collection and privacy policy shows how we get information from http://www.smartviper.com 
    site (the "Site") and controls the information you give us. The policy doesn’t control the entries or 
    edits you submit to the Site. That information is dealt with singly at this link Terms and Conditions 
    of Use. Any changed and revised information collection and privacy policy shall come into force right 
    after posting on the Site. 
    
    
    
    In case of questions or concerns concerning this statement, users can contact Smartviper.com or send 
    mail to Website Administrator (see mail at the bottom of this page). We will try to respond to 
    every inquiry. 
    But the volume of inquiries we receive is very high so we may respond to your inquiry after a while. 
    
    
    
    SmartViper obtains information concerning websites from the public "whois" databases which domain 
    name registries and registrars publish on the Internet. We also receive information concerning 
    websites from other public sources and from the "about us" section of websites. Then we make that 
    information available, together with a link to the websites, screenshots, and logos one centralized 
    place of the Site. We also put a map that is some kind of a spatial representation of otherwise public 
    information. Everybody can build this map using the "about us" tool and one of innumerable free web 
    mapping applications available in the Internet. As we only make available from the Site information 
    which is publicly available, we may make available contact information for a website. Users 
    may freely edit and add data concerning websites. 
    
    
    
    If you don’t wish our bot to collect information about your website just follow the instructions on 
    the SmartViper:Bot page. 
    
    
    
    Control of User Provided/Edited Posts: 
    
    
    
    Users of SmartViper can freely edit entries. Here we don’t control the identity of any user 
    who provides information or make edits. An "Owner Contributed Information" feature will allow 
    you as the owner of a website to control the basic information about that website. In any case 
    you should know that we haven’t controlled information and you should control this information 
    yourself before relying on it. 
    
    
    
    SmartViper Respects Intellectual Property Rights: 
    
    
    
    SmartViper respects the intellectual property rights of third parties. It will never be involved 
    in measures which contain copyright or trademark violation. SmartViper is meant for providing 
    free information concerning domain names and related websites. Here, you can find educational, 
    critical and accurate information about websites. We don’t publish texts or images from a site 
    with the purpose of their providing. We just make them available to provide information about 
    the site itself. We can’t precisely provide full information about a site without watching the 
    information from the site itself. 
    
    
    
    SmartViper presents information which may not be entitled to copyright defense in the first 
    instance. Display of smaller thumbnail-size images and of public text falls under "fair use". 
    Copyright and trademark law include exclusions for "fair use". Fair use is a statutorily recognized 
    exception to copyright law. United States courts apply a four factor test to define whether a 
    use constitutes "fair use" under copyright law. According to this test, SmartViper’s use 
    constitutes fair use. First of all, SmartViper’s use of the information differs from the initial 
    expressive purpose of the information. SmartViper has collected this information in a single 
    place with the aim of providing knowledge concerning domain names and websites, open for 
    editing by the user.
    
    
    
    Secondly, SmartViper doesn’t use the expressive value of text or images we make available. 
    We use the text and images in order to inform users about the domain names and website where 
    the complete text and full images may be found. Thirdly, the restricted or reduced use of 
    the texts and images is compatible with transformative purpose of SmartViper. And finally, 
    SmartViper doesn’t harm the market with the underlying data. Reproducing data about your 
    website we are simply raising potential exposure for your website. Thus SmartViper’s use 
    of the information constitutes fair use after application of the fair use test. You can 
    watch additional information and discussion about SmartViper’s position on fair use and 
    intellectual property policy at Intellectual Property Policy.
