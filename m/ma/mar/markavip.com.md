## 4\. Use of Facebook and Twitter social plugins

The Platform may use social plugins (“plugins”) provided by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The plugins are identifiable by a Facebook logo or the notice “Facebook Social Plugin”.

When you visit a page of the Platform that contains a social plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook and/or Twitter servers. Facebook and Twitter directly transfer the plugin content to your browser which embeds the latter into the Platform, enabling Facebook and Twitter to receive information about your having accessed the respective page of the Platform. For this purpose, the internet address of the visited site (your IP address included) is transferred to a USA-based Facebook and/or Twitter server where the data are stored. This occurs even if you do not have a Facebook or Twitter account or are not logged into Facebook/Twitter at the time.

If you are logged into Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking “Like”, or entering a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored by it. The information can also be published on Facebook, and shown to your Facebook friends.
