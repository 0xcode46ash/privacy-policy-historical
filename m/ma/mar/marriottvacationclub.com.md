INTERNET PRIVACY STATEMENT **

**Introduction**

Marriott Vacation Club International has a strong commitment to providing excellent service to all of our customers, including respecting their concerns about privacy. We understand that visitors to this website may have questions about whether and how this website collects and uses information. We have prepared this statement to inform you of the privacy principles that govern Marriottvacationclub.com. Please note that a separate privacy statement and separate terms and conditions apply to the Marriott Rewards program (<http://www.marriottrewards.com/rewards/terms/privacy.asp>), although the same governing Marriott philosophy applies. 

This statement contains numerous general and technical details about the steps we take to respect your privacy concerns. The bottom line is that the needs and expectations of our customers form the foundation of everything we do – including protecting your privacy.
