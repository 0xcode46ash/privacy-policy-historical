****  
THE INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE AND DISSEMINATION PRACTICES OF COMMITTEE.****

****1\. Collection of Information.****

****1.1 Survey Information.****

**COMMITTEE collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by Third Parties (collectively, a “Survey”). (As used herein, “online” means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and “offline” means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, COMMITTEE or a Third Party (a “Third Party”) may ask an individual to provide various information to COMMITTEE, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, “Survey Information”). COMMITTEE may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site.  Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to COMMITTEE or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from COMMITTEE or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to COMMITTEE.**

****1.2 Site Membership or Registration.****

**To the extent registration is required to receive email and possibly postal communications from COMMITTEE, this Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from COMMITTEE, whether at our Website, via email, on Third Party websites or otherwise.  We may collect information in certain portions of our Website, where guests provide content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities (i.e., by way of responding to questions and surveys, community listings, ratings, searches and comparison searches, bidding, purchasing, chat, games, or bulletin boards, etc.). The personal profile information you submit to COMMITTEE remains your property, but by submitting that information to COMMITTEE, you grant COMMITTEE, the right to use that information for marketing purposes. COMMITTEE may also use such information for content improvement and feedback purposes.  We may share the personal information that you supply to us and we may join together with other organizations or businesses to bring selected information and retail opportunities to our members. In addition, COMMITTEE reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event COMMITTEE believes that the membership is being or has been used in violation of our rules or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if COMMITTEE is sold or acquired, or when COMMITTEE deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any Third Party when COMMITTEE, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate.**

**“Subscription” occurs when an end-user registers for COMMITTEE’s information, services, or offers either via registration at our website, via co-registration at a marketing partner’s website, or via a permission pass / opt-out / no-opt mailing. COMMITTEE collects personally identifiable information about our subscribers, based on: information gathered at the time of registration, subscriber interaction and response to subsequent electronic mailings and website use, information provided by marketing partners, and information appended from data aggregators. Information collected may include, but is not necessarily limited to: name, email address, postal address, gender, birth date, telephone number, activity, interests, user behavior and other demographic information. This information enables us to better tailor our content to subscribers’ needs and to help our clients to promote and sell their products and services.**

****1.3 Third Party List Information.**** **  
**

**COMMITTEE collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and COMMITTEE subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the “Seller”).  Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual’s name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, “Third Party List Information”). When acquiring Third Party List Information, COMMITTEE seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to COMMITTEE and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from Advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller’s list.**

****1.4 Other Information.****

**Other occasions when COMMITTEE obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by COMMITTEE or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through COMMITTEE’s customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a COMMITTEE service or newsletter (together, “Other Information”).**

****1.5 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.****

**COMMITTEE may use cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, COMMITTEE may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, “Technology Information”).**

****(a) Cookies.****

**A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual’s computer that allows COMMITTEE to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in COMMITTEE’s database.  You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.**

****(b)**** ** **Web Beacons.****

**A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an <img src=”x”> programming function — see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual’s unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database.  This allows COMMITTEE to track certain websites an individual visits online.  Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes.  For example, COMMITTEE might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party’s website where cosmetics are sold. When Jane, an individual listed in COMMITTEE’s database, visits the cosmetic website, COMMITTEE receives notice by means of the web beacon that Jane visited the cosmetics site, and COMMITTEE would then update Jane s profile with the information that Jane is interested in cosmetics.  COMMITTEE may thereafter present offers of cosmetic related products and services to Jane.  In addition to using web beacons on web pages, COMMITTEE also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in COMMITTEE’S database.**

****(c) New Technology.****

**The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is COMMITTEE’S use of new and evolving technology.  As a result, COMMITTEE strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.**

****(d) Usage Tracking.****

**COMMITTEE** **tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing our emails or visiting our websites.**

****(e) Log Files.****

**Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage.**

****(f) Optional Registration.****

**COMMITTEE** **may offer free voluntary registration to potential subscribers.  During such registration, the subscriber is required to supply an email address and other personal information.  This information is required if the subscriber wants to participate in COMMITTEE services or receive COMMITTEE information.**

****(g) Feedback and Inquiries.****

**You have the ability to contact** **COMMITTEE** **to provide us with their feedback. COMMITTEE uses this information to respond to you and analyze customer service issues.** **  
**

****1.6 Outside Information.****

**COMMITTEE may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of information outside of COMMITTEE including information located in public databases (“Outside Information”).**

****1.7 Individual Information.****

**As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information COMMITTEE gathers or receives about individuals.**

****1.8 No Information Collected from Children.****

**COMMITTEE will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13.  If COMMITTEE obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.**

**Because it does not collect such information, COMMITTEE has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties.  COMMITTEE has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).**

****1.9 Credit Card Information.****

**COMMITTEE may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card (“Credit Card Information”) when an individual places an order from COMMITTEE.  When the Credit Card Information is submitted to COMMITTEE, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. COMMITTEE will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to Third Parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction. Contributions are non-refundable. You will receive an email confirmation of your contribution.**

****1.10 Links to External Websites.****

**COMMITTEE’S emails and websites may contain links to external websites.  You will be taken to external websites if you click on these links.  Your information may be passed from COMMITTEE’S database to the external website, and/or external database, for your convenience (e.g. your information may be used to pre-fill a form at a destination website). COMMITTEE is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any external website owner.  We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any website you visit.**

****2\. Use of Individual Information.****

****2.1 Discretion to Use Information.****

****COMMITTEE MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMMITTEE’S SOLE DISCRETION.****

**The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how COMMITTEE currently uses Individual Information, but COMMITTEE may change or broaden its use at any time.  As noted above, COMMITTEE may update this policy from time to time. COMMITTEE may use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.**

****2.2 Email and Unsubscribe Policy.****

**COMMITTEE uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email to individuals.  COMMITTEE may maintain separate email lists for different purposes.  If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list.  To unsubscribe from all COMMITTEE’S email lists, a person must send an email to ******team@marcorubio.com**** **.**

**COMMITTEE’S unsubscribe process impacts only the future delivery of electronic mailings disseminated by COMMITTEE on its own behalf.  You may still receive electronic mailings sent on behalf of Third Parties and your personal information may still be shared with Third Parties for use in offline marketing and data appends, including email appends.**

**You should also note that unsubscribing from COMMITTEE’S electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe the subscriber’s information from any Third Party associates and licensees of the data.  Since Third Party associates and licensee partners maintain separate databases from COMMITTEE, and you will need to unsubscribe from each source individually, if desired.  This allows you the freedom to pick and choose which subscriptions to maintain and which to discontinue.**

****2.3 Solicited Email.****

**COMMITTEE only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Websites to receive email from COMMITTEE or to individuals who have agreed on Third Party websites to receive email from Third Parties such as COMMITTEE.   COMMITTEE does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to COMMITTEE’s email messages.**

****2.4 Targeted Advertising.****

**COMMITTEE may use Individual Information to target advertising to an individual.  When an individual is using the Internet, COMMITTEE may use Technology Information (see also Section 2.7 below) to associate an individual with that person’s Individual Information, and COMMITTEE may attempt to show advertising for products and services in which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology Information, and otherwise. COMMITTEE may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.**

****2.5 Direct Mail and Telemarketing.****

**COMMITTEE may use Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones and such contact shall be deemed to be with the permission of individuals covered by this Privacy Policy.**

****2.6 Use of Technology Information.****

**COMMITTEE may use Technology Information (1) to match a person’s Survey Information and Third Party List Information to other categories of Individual Information to make and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to track a person’s online browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine which areas of COMMITTEE’S websites are most frequently visited. This information helps COMMITTEE to better understand the online habits of individuals so that COMMITTEE can target advertising and promotions to them.**

****2.7 Profiles of Individuals.****

**COMMITTEE uses Individual Information to make a profile of an individual.  A profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with other sources of Individual Information such as information obtained from public databases.**

****2.9 Storage of Individual Information.****

**COMMITTEE stores the Individual Information in a database on its own computers, or licensed third party computers.  Our computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under COMMITTEE’s control.  Not withstanding such measures, COMMITTEE cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent its computers from being illegally accessed, and the Individual Information on them stolen or altered.**

**Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies (together, “Advertisers”) who place advertisements on the Websites and on the Internet generally may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other technology to collect information about individuals.
