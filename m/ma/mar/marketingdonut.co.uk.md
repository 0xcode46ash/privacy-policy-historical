# Privacy policy, cookies | Marketing Donut

**Note: We do not pass your contact details or any other information about you as an individual to third parties of any kind (unless requested by you to do so, or unless required to do so by law), as detailed below.**

This website is operated by BHP Information Solutions Ltd (BHP). We take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy describes how and why we obtain, store and process data which can identify you.

## The information we collect

We use cookies on the Marketing Donut, to collect information about your use of the website. When you visit the website you can allow or disallow it to store cookies on your computer's hard drive, by customising your cookie preferences using your web browser's preferences/options/tools.

We also receive your username, email address and postcode if you choose to register on the website.

## Why we collect it

We collect information about you so that we can personalise your use of the website. There are many different versions of the Marketing Donut and we are able to show you a version that is most appropriate for you; for example, a version that includes the news and information of an organisation that you are a member of.

If you have registered on the website, cookies also allow you to log in automatically in the future. The cookie will be stored on your computer's hard drive and will remember your username and password.

We also collect aggregated information about every single link and page on the Marketing Donut website, so we can measure the website's performance. This allows us to create more of the pages that users like and to remove unused content. It also allows BHP to attract sponsorship for each section of the Marketing Donut website.

If you opt-in to subscribe to the newsletter (by ticking this preference when registering) you will, at a later date, be able to request additional content on particular topics. (This preference functionality will increase over time, as BHP provides a wider and deeper set of content to choose from.) You may update your contact preferences, or opt out of receiving the newsletter, at any time.

## Who we disclose it to

We will only pass on information about you as an individual (as opposed to aggregated information) to third parties to enable us to perform services requested by you or with your prior consent.

In certain circumstances we may need to disclose information about you if you breach the terms and conditions of the website. We may also disclose or access your account if required to do so by law.

## Data Protection

BHP is registered with the Information Commissioner in the UK as a ‘data controller' in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998. Further details of the registration are available at [www.ico.gov.uk](http://www.ico.gov.uk/ "www.ico.gov.uk").

## Security

Keeping information about you secure is very important to us. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which you send to us, and you do so at your own risk.
