Maritz Holdings Inc., its subsidiaries and divisions (collectively, “Maritz”), is committed to building user trust and confidence by promoting, and complying with, business practices that help protect the privacy of our customer and user data. This policy provides our commitment to your privacy by describing our information, practices and policies to ensure compliance with the Privacy Shield privacy framework, as defined by the U.S. Department of Commerce in cooperation with Switzerland and the European Commission.

The Privacy Shield program helps assure Swiss and other European members that adequate privacy protections are followed by participants to allow the transfer of personal data to non-European Union (EU) countries otherwise not meeting the Swiss and EU “adequacy” standards for privacy protection. 

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has jurisdiction over Maritz' compliance with the Privacy Shield.

Maritz has met the requisite seven privacy principles to participate in the Privacy Shield program. For more information about the Privacy Shield program and its benefits visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome>.

A list of the seven principles and how Maritz meets these requirements follow:
