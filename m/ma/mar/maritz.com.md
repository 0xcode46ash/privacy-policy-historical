European Union, Swiss & Canadian Data Privacy

Maritz adheres to the Safe Harbor Agreement concerning the transfer of personal data from the EU to the United States. Maritz also adheres to the Safe Harbor Agreement concerning the transfer of personal data from Switzerland to the United States. Accordingly, Maritz follows the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Principles") with respect to all such data, and this Privacy Statement complies with such Principles. Compliance with the Principles may be limited, however, in certain cases to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest or law enforcement requirements. All Maritz personnel with access to personal data are obligated to familiarize themselves and comply with provisions of this Privacy Statement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Maritz' certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>

Definitions

"Sensitive personal data" is a subset of personal data that indicates an individual's medical or health condition, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, union membership, sexual orientation, or actual or alleged criminal activity.

"Maritz" refers to Maritz Holdings Inc., its U.S. subsidiaries and divisions, including but not limited to the following: Maritz Motivation Solutions Inc.; Maritz Research Inc., and Maritz Travel Company.

Notice

Maritz collects personal data from and about individuals for use generally in connection with the operation of its business. Such personal data may be used by Maritz to provide incentive, performance improvement, loyalty marketing, learning, travel, market research, or other goods and services to its clients. In addition, Maritz may use personal data in order to properly manage the employment or contractor relationship with the individual that is the subject of such data. Maritz may disclose personal data to third parties when such disclosure is necessary or appropriate for Maritz' provision of such services to its clients or otherwise for Maritz' operation of its business. Maritz may also disclose personal data to third parties in circumstances described in the "Onward Transfer to Third Parties" section below.

Any complaints or questions should be directed to Maritz' Chief Privacy Officer, Derek C. Mays, whose contact information is as follows: 1375 N. Highway Drive, Fenton, Missouri 63099; derek.mays@maritz.com; telephone (636) 827-2170.

When Maritz receives personal data from Switzerland, the EU or Canada merely for processing purposes and does not control the collection of the personal data, Maritz may not provide notification of this Statement to the individuals to which such personal data relates. In such event, Maritz reserves the right to process personal data in the course of providing services to its clients without the knowledge of the individuals involved.

Choice

Except as provided below, Maritz gives individuals from whom it collects personal data the opportunity to opt out from allowing Maritz to disclose his or her personal data to a third party or to use it for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected. For sensitive personal data, Maritz requires such individual to affirmatively opt in and give consent if the data is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than its original purpose.

Individuals desiring to exercise their opt out rights should contact Maritz' Chief Privacy Officer, Derek C. Mays, whose contact information is as follows: 1375 N. Highway Drive, Fenton, Missouri 63099; derek.mays@maritz.com; telephone (636) 827-2170. Individuals from whom sensitive personal data is sought will be advised of how to opt in and give the required consent at the time the data is collected, if the data is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than its original purpose.

When Maritz receives personal data from Switzerland, the EU or Canada merely for processing purposes and does not control the collection of the personal data, Maritz may not provide such choices to the individuals to whom such personal data relates. In such event, Maritz reserves the right to process personal data in the course of providing services to its clients without the knowledge of the individuals involved. 

Onward Transfer to Third Parties

Maritz may disclose personal data to a third party if (a) Maritz has received the applicable individual's permission to make the disclosure, (b) the disclosure is required by law, (c) the disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or other disposition of all or part of Maritz' business, (d) the information in question is publicly available, and/or (e) the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment of a legal claim.

Additionally, Maritz may disclose personal data to a third party if the disclosure is to a Maritz affiliate or to persons or entities providing services on behalf of Maritz, a Maritz client, or the individual (each a "transferee"), consistent with the purpose for which the information was obtained, if the transferee, with respect to the data in question (a) is subject to law providing an adequate level of privacy protection including, without limitation, transferees that are located within Switzerland, the EU or Canada or transferees that are otherwise subject to an "adequacy" finding, (b) has agreed in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection, and/or (c) subscribes to the Principles.

Security

Maritz takes reasonable precautions to protect personal data from loss, misuse, tampering, destruction and unauthorized access. These precautions include password protections for on-line information systems, restricted access to personal data within the Human Resources Division, and other measures implemented by Maritz Global Technology Services and other Maritz divisions.

Data Integrity

Maritz takes reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is accurate, complete, current and relevant for the purposes for which it was collected. Among other steps, Maritz employees are asked to inform a Human Resources representative of any changes in their personal data.

Access

Upon request and consistent with any applicable client commitments, Maritz will permit individuals to access their personal data and to correct any erroneous information. The individual may need to provide sufficient identifying information, such as, without limitation, name, address, birth date, and social security or national health insurance or an equivalent number. Such access may be denied or limited by Maritz, however, if providing such access is unreasonably burdensome, expensive under the circumstances, and/or if giving access to such information would violate another person's rights. In some circumstances, Maritz may charge a reasonable fee for access to personal data.

Enforcement

Maritz will conduct an annual self-assessment to ensure that this Privacy Statement is published and disseminated within Maritz and that it conforms to the Principles. In addition, Maritz has deployed internal processes to monitor Maritz' compliance with the Principles and to address all questions or complaints. Maritz will also self-certify annually with the U.S. Department of Commerce as being in compliance with the Principles.

Individuals may raise any concerns or complaints regarding their personal data directly with Maritz by contacting Maritz' Chief Privacy Officer, Derek C. Mays, at its Fenton, Missouri headquarters. If an individual raises such a concern or complaint, Maritz will investigate the matter and attempt to resolve all issues to the satisfaction of the individual raising the concern or complaint. If the matter cannot be settled at that stage, Maritz agrees to cooperate with competent Swiss, EU or Canadian data protection authorities.

Modification and Amendment

Maritz may modify or amend this Privacy Statement from time to time by posting a revised Privacy Statement on the web at www.maritz.com. If Maritz amends this Privacy Statement, the new statement will apply to personal data previously collected only insofar as the rights of the individuals affected are not reduced. So long as Maritz adheres to the Safe Harbor Agreement, Maritz will not amend this Privacy Statement in a manner inconsistent with the Principles.

Other Maritz Policies

This Privacy Statement is subject to other policies and procedures implemented by Maritz. For instance, if another Maritz policy or procedure grants broader rights to Maritz relating to the collection, handling or disclosure of personal data, Maritz may exercise those broader rights.
