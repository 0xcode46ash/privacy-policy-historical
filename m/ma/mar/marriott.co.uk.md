| Information We Collect and How We Use It  
  
---  
  
When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you to provide you with a particular service, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our hotels, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number (if applicable) and room preference to process your reservation. We will use your email address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help in processing the reservation. We will also use your email address to:

  1. send you a pre-arrival message summarizing your confirmation details and providing other information about the area and the hotel;
  2. notify you about special offers and promotions as described in the email section of this privacy statement; as well as
  3. send you periodic satisfaction or market research surveys.



You can opt out of marketing emails at any time. You can also opt out of Marriott research surveys. The same types of information would be requested to complete a gift certificate purchase, register for a Marriott Rewards or Ritz-Carlton promotion, enter a sweepstakes or online game, to enroll in the Marriott/Ritz-Carlton Rewards program or to redeem Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards points. On occasion, we use third parties to provide us with additional contact information about you given the information you provided to us directly. For example, if we know your name and postal address, we may use a third party to provide us with your email address. We would then use this information for market analysis and marketing purposes.

| Creating a Personal Account  
  
---  
At your choice, you may create a personal account containing information such as your preferred Marriott hotel brands, frequently visited cities, interests (e.g., golf, tennis), and whether you travel with children or pets.  Creating a personal account makes it more convenient for you to make reservations by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter personal preference information.  It will allow us to inform you about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you.  In addition, if you choose, you can include your credit card information in your account.  Your credit card information will be used for subsequent reservations to increase reservation speed and eliminate the need for you to repeatedly enter your credit card information.  The security of this information is addressed in security section below. 

You can access and review, update or deactivate, your personal account information on-line.  If you deactivate your personal account and are a Marriott Rewards member, all information not already required and stored as a condition of membership will be deleted.  If you are not a Marriott Rewards member and deactivate your personal account, the user ID and password are deleted and the account is recorded as inactive.
