**Browsing**

This website does not collect personally identifiable information from your computer when you browse this website and request pages from our servers. This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with personally identifiable information, we will not know your name, your e-mail address, or any other personally identifiable information. When you request a page from our web site, our servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header including the IP number, the time of the request, the URL of your request and other information that is provided in the HTTP header. We collect the HTTP request header information in order to make our website function correctly and provide you the functionality that you see on this website, as our servers use this information to deliver to you the pages on this website. We also use this information to better understand how visitors use our website and how we can better tune our website, its contents and functionality to meet your needs. 

**Information We Collect**

When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you to provide you with a particular service we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our hotels, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, Marriott Rewards number (if applicable) and room preference to process your reservation. We will use your e-mail address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help to process the reservation. We will also use your e-mail address to notify you about special offers and promotions as described in the E-Mail section of this Statement, but you can opt out of e-mails at any time by following the procedures outlined in that section of this Statement. The same types of information would be requested to complete a gift certificate purchase, register for a Marriott Planner Points promotion, to enroll in the Marriott Rewards program or to redeem Marriott Rewards points.

The personally identifiable information you provide to us for making a reservation, is made available to the applicable hotel for the purpose of meeting your reservation request. If you cancel your reservation, the information is stored for recordkeeping purposes only and is not accessed again. After making a reservation or completing your stay at a Marriott, unless you tell us otherwise, the information you provide will be used by us for direct marketing of Marriott hotels and other Marriott products or the products of select, reputable third parties with whom Marriott has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer products or services that we believe would of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive this information, you may indicate so by accessing the unsubscribe link.Â  Marriott may use the services of a third party mail house for the sole purpose of mailing materials.

**Creating a Personal Account**

At your choice, you may create a personal account containing information such as your preferred Marriott hotel brands, frequently visited cities, interests (e.g., golf, tennis), and whether you travel with children or travel with pets. You can create a personal account by clicking on the "Create Account" link on this website. Creating a personal account makes it more convenient for you to make reservations by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter personal preference information. It will allow us to inform you about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. In addition, if you choose, you can include credit card information in your account. Your credit card information will be used for subsequent reservations to increase reservation speed and eliminate the need for you to repeatedly enter your credit card information. The security of this information is addressed in security section below. 

You can access and review, update or deactivate your personal account information on-line. If you deactivate your personal account and are a Marriott Rewards member, all information not already required and stored as a condition of membership will be deleted. If you are not a Marriott Rewards member and deactivate your personal account the information you submitted to create the account will be deleted.

**Marriott Rewards Communications and Use of Member Information**

Communications of relevant information is important to administering the Marriott Rewards program and providing you the opportunity to maximize the benefits of membership. We will only disclose member information to the Marriott group of companies on a need-to-know basis, person(s) authorized by you, Marriott franchisees, and mail houses that process mail for such entities, for the following purposes: 1) in order to best service your account and preferences by keeping you informed of your account status and activities through printed or electronic statements, 2) to assess your entitlement to benefits, 3) to collect and process charges incurred by you in Marriott facilities, 4) to offer you additional products and services and 5) to offer you products or services from select reputable companies with whom Marriott has a strategic relationship because we believe their offerings will be of interest to you.

**Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information**

We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. When we ask you for credit card data it is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line provided you are using a SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. We also use SSL on other select pages where you would enter personally identifiable information. This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from your computer. You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock or key icon in the lower right-hand or left-hand corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position. In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."

After information reaches Marriott it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Marriott. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our hotels or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the sites covered by this Statement is generally processed and stored in the United States.  


**Travel Related Services**

To provide you with a single source for purchasing packages that include other travel related services such as airline tickets or rental cars, we have entered into agreements with select reputable third party travel companies that aggregate inventory information from suppliers such as airlines and car rental companies. If you desire to purchase a package that is facilitated through Marriott.com you will be linked to a Marriott branded website that is hosted by the travel company. If you choose to purchase a package, it is necessary for you to provide personally identifiable information to execute the purchase. This information is then provided to the suppliers (e.g., airlines) for processing. We have entered into contracts with these third party travel companies requiring that they secure your personally identifiable information as well as use it only to execute the transactions you request. The same security and privacy commitments have been obtained from the suppliers. However, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you have supplied directly to a supplier in any manner in the past or in the future is subject to their privacy statement and practices for which Marriott has no responsibility.

**Disclosure of Information to Third Parties**

In addition to the travel related services and required information sharing described directly above, Marriott does use the services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers and marketing companies that act as agents on behalf of Marriott. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose Marriott specifies. In addition, we may disclose your personally identifiable information to successors in title to our business. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the Marriott family of companies and hotels for their use without your approval.

Our website uses "cookie" technology. "Cookies" are encrypted strings of text that a website stores on a user's computer. Our website requires the use of a cookie throughout the online reservation process. Without cookies we will not be able to keep information you enter on multiple pages together. For example, unless Marriott.com can remember the dates you used in your hotel search we will not be able to check room availability. Cookies also enable us to customize our website and offerings to your needs and provide you with a better online experience on Marriott.com. In addition, cookies are used to: 

  * allow registered users to sign in without typing their sign in name each time; 
  * measure usage of various pages on our website to help us make our information more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access; and 
  * provide functionality such as online reservations, Marriott Rewards transactions and other functionality that we believe would be of interest and value to you.



The types of cookies that we use are referred to as "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies. Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once you leave Marriott.com. Persistent cookies remain on your computer hard drive until you delete them. We do not use cookies to gather information concerning your visits to other sites, nor ascertain any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with Marriott. Cookies do not corrupt or damage your computer, programs, or computer files.

**Pixel Tags**

**  
**Marriott and its third party service providers use pixel tags (also known as "clear gifs", "beacon gifs", etc.). Pixel tags are not visible to the user of the web site and consist of a few lines of computer coding. Pixel tags are not used to collect any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with Marriott. Marriott and our e-mail service provider use pixel tags to:

  * track responses to Marriott advertisements and site content; 
  * determine your ability to receive HTML-based e-mail messages. Our e-mail service provider includes a pixel tag, which they refer to as a "coded sensor", in all of the HTML-based messages sent on our behalf. The sensor activates when the e-mail message is opened and flags the e-mail address of the user as one that is capable of receiving HTML-based email messages. This capability helps our service provider to send the e-mail in a format you can read. The sensor does not collect or use any other information. If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor. 
  * know how many users open an e-mail and allow our service provider to compile aggregated statistics about an e-mail campaign for us; and   
allow us to better target interactive advertising, enhance customer support and site usability, and provide offers and promotions that we believe would be of interest to you.
