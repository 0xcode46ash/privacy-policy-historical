| Information We Collect and How We Use It  
  
---  
When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you to provide you with a particular service, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need.  For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our hotels, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, Marriott Rewards number (if applicable) and room preference to process your reservation.  We will use your email address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help in processing the reservation.  We will also use your email address to:

1) send you a pre-arrival message summarizing your confirmation details and providing other information about the area and the hotel;

2) notify you about special offers and promotions as described in the email section of this privacy statement; as well as;

3) send you periodic satisfaction or market research surveys.

You can opt out of the marketing emails and Marriott research surveys at any time by following the procedure outlined in the email marketing message or in the research survey. The same types of information would be requested to complete a gift certificate purchase, register for a Marriott Rewards promotion, enter a sweepstakes or online game, to enroll in the Marriott Rewards program or to redeem Marriott Rewards points.  On occasion, we use third parties to provide us with additional contact information about you given the information you provided to us directly.  For example, if we know your name and postal address, we may use a third party to provide us with your email address.  We would then use this information for market analysis and marketing purposes.

| Creating a Personal Account  
  
---  
At your choice, you may create a personal account containing information such as your preferred Marriott hotel brands, frequently visited cities, interests (e.g., golf, tennis), and whether you travel with children or pets.  Creating a personal account makes it more convenient for you to make reservations by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter personal preference information.  It will allow us to inform you about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you.  In addition, if you choose, you can include your credit card information in your account.  Your credit card information will be used for subsequent reservations to increase reservation speed and eliminate the need for you to repeatedly enter your credit card information.  The security of this information is addressed in security section below. 

You can access and review, update or deactivate, your personal account information on-line.  If you deactivate your personal account and are a Marriott Rewards member, all information not already required and stored as a condition of membership will be deleted.  If you are not a Marriott Rewards member and deactivate your personal account, the user ID and password are deleted and the account is recorded as inactive.

| Updating your personal Account information  
  
---  
You can access and review, update, or deactivate your personal account information online.  If you deactivate your personal account and are a Marriott Rewards member, all information not already required and stored as a condition of membership will be deleted.  If you are not a Marriott Rewards member and deactivate your personal account, the user ID and password are deleted and the account is recorded as inactive.

Please note that Marriott **will never send you email requesting your user name, password, credit card number or social security number**. If you receive an email that looks like it's from Marriott, but asks you for your credit card number or social security number, it's a fraudulent email, or "phish." We recommend that you do the delete the email.

If you believe "phishers" have gotten access to your personal or financial information, we recommend that you change your password.

| Cookies  
  
---  
Our Web site uses “cookie” technology. “Cookies” are encrypted strings of text that a Web site stores on a user’s computer.  Our Web site requires the use of a cookie throughout the online reservation process.   Without cookies we will not be able to keep information you enter on multiple pages together.  For example, unless Marriott.com can remember the dates you used in your hotel search we will not be able to check room availability.   Cookies also enable us to customize our Web site and offerings to your needs and provide you with a better online experience on Marriott.com.  In addition, cookies are used to:  


  * allow registered users to sign in without typing their sign-in name each time;

  * measure usage of various pages on our Web site to help us make our information more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access; and

  * provide functionality such as online reservations, Marriott Rewards transactions, and other functionality that we believe would be of interest and value to you.  



The types of cookies that we use are referred to as “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies.   Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once you close your internet browser. Persistent cookies remain on your computer hard drive until you delete them or are otherwise removed upon expiration.  We do not use cookies to ascertain any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with Marriott.  Cookies do not corrupt or damage your computer, programs, or computer files.

  We use third-party advertising technology to serve ads when you visit our Web site and sites upon which we advertise.  This technology uses information about your visits to this Web site and the sites upon which we advertise, (not including your name, address, or other personally identifiable information), to serve our ads to you.  In the course of serving our advertisements to you, a unique third-party persistent cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser.  In addition, we use beacon gifs (see description below), provided by our ad-serving providers, to help manage our online advertising.  These beacon gifs enable our ad server to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits this site and to learn which banner ads bring users to our Web site and whether a reservation on Marriott.com is executed.  The information our ad-serving providers and we collect through this technology is not personally identifiable.

| Pixel Tags  
  
---  
Marriott and its third party service providers use pixel tags (also known as “clear gifs,” “beacon gifs,”etc.).  Pixel tags are not visible to the user of the Web site and consist of a few lines of computer coding delivered with the Web page.  Pixel tags are not used to collect any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with Marriott.  Marriott and our email service provider use pixel tags to:  


  * track customer response to Marriott advertisements and Web site content;

  * determine your ability to receive HTML-based email messages. Our email service provider includes a pixel tag, which they refer to as a “coded sensor,” in all of the HTML-based messages sent on our behalf.  The sensor activates when the email message is opened and flags the email address of the user as one that is capable of receiving HTML-based email messages.  This capability helps our service provider to send the email in a format you can read.  The sensor does not collect or use any other information.  If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor.

  * know how many users open an email and allow our service provider to compile aggregated statistics about an email campaign for us; and 

  * allow us to better target interactive advertising, enhance customer support and site usability, and provide offers and promotions that we believe would be of interest to you.
