| Information We Collect and How We Use It  
  
---  
When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you to provide you with a particular service, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our hotels, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number (if applicable) and room preference to process your reservation. We will use your email address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help in processing the reservation. We will also use your email address to:  


  1. send you a pre-arrival message summarizing your confirmation details and providing other information about the area and the hotel;
  2. notify you about special offers and promotions as described in the email section of this privacy statement; as well as
  3. send you periodic satisfaction or market research surveys.  


You can opt out of marketing emails at any time. You can also opt out of Marriott research surveys. The same types of information would be requested to complete a gift certificate purchase, register for a Marriott Rewards or Ritz-Carlton promotion, enter a sweepstakes or online game, to enroll in the Marriott/Ritz-Carlton Rewards program or to redeem Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards points. On occasion, we use third parties to provide us with additional contact information about you given the information you provided to us directly. For example, if we know your name and postal address, we may use a third party to provide us with your email address. We would then use this information for market analysis and marketing purposes.

| eFolio  
  
---  
If you choose to participate in the in the eFolio program ("Program") you will receive hotel bills by email ("eFolio"). The eFolio will be sent to you over the Internet in an unsecured (unencrypted) manner and could be subject to interception by third parties.

If you are an employee of a company that participates in Marriott's eFolio Program and you enroll in the program and then use the corporate credit card that is provided to you by your employer to pay for your hotel expenses (hotel folio) at a Marriott property located in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico or Aruba, an extract of your hotel folio detailing the goods and services provided to you during your hotel stay (as an individual traveler, or as part of a group, meeting or event) will be transferred electronically to the credit card company or its agents, who will in turn, forward that extract to your employer to facilitate the processing and tracking of the travel related expenses of their employees.

Additionally, please be advised that your Marriott/Ritz-Carlton Rewards number, as entered on your reservation, acts as the eFolio identifier, prompting your bill to be transmitted to your email address of record. If your Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number is applied to another person's room reservation, or if you make a reservation for another person and provide your email address for that reservation that person's bill will be transmitted to your email address as well. It is your responsibility to inform that person that their bill will be emailed to you when your Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number or email address is attached to his/her reservation unless he/she makes alternative arrangements with a front desk associate during the stay.
