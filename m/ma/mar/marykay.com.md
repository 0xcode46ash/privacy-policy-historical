### Information Security

We are committed to keeping personal information secure. We have appropriate technical, administrative and physical procedures in place to protect personal information from loss, misuse or alteration.

We limit access to personal information to those who have a business need. We keep personal information only for a reasonably needed amount of time.

Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a country other than the one in which it was provided. This may include the United States. When we do so, we transfer the information in compliance with applicable data protection laws.

We take steps to protect personal information. Regardless of where this information is stored or transferred, we have the appropriate procedures and controls to help ensure your personal information is protected.

We adhere to country data privacy laws including the EU Data Privacy Directive, as well as the U.S. Department of Commerce [Safe Harbor Program](http://export.gov/safeharbor/).

We may transfer personal information to Mary Kay databases in countries other than where it was provided. Our Global Privacy Program requires the same high level of security and protection of personal information in all geographies with procedures and contracts in place to help ensure this is so. Data may be temporarily transferred to a vendor or business partner to provide services for Mary Kay, such as targeted email communications, mailing information or samples. These vendors and business partners are required to protect and manage the personal information to the same high standards Mary Kay does, and they cannot use the information for purposes other than to provide the services Mary Kay has requested.

### Children's Online Privacy

We believe it is important to provide added protection for children online. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to participate in and monitor their online activity.

We do not intend to collect personal information from children under the age of 14. We ask for a age confirmation in connection with the collection of personal information on our web sites in order to avoid the collection of information from individuals under the age of 14.
