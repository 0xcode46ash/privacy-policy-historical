# Male Grooming Tips and Products from Mankind

**Your privacy and the security of your personal information is our highest priority.  
**  
We also want to provide you the best and easiest online shopping experience possible. In order to do this we need to gather certain pieces of information from you. 

Your name and address is required to send you catalogues, samples and to deliver products you have ordered. 

From time to time, we allow other companies to use your name and address (as permitted by law) in order to offer you other outstanding products or services which we feel may be of interest to you. Even in these circumstances, we do not divulge any other information about you, including your email address. You have the option to opt out of receiving these mailings when you register. 

We ask for your e-mail address and password when you register on the site. You then do not need to re-enter your name and address when you return to the site at a later date. We use your email address to confirm your order and to keep you informed of the progress of your order. 

The only other occasion when Mankind will use your e-mail address is, with your permission, to send you from time to time further information on products and special offers. Again, you have the option to opt out of receiving our email newsletter when you register. 

**Your email address will never be disclosed to any third party.**

To discuss any matters relating to privacy, you may contact Paul Jameson at Mankind by phone (0870 443 7060) or email [paul@mankind.co.uk ](mailto:paul@mankind.co.uk)
