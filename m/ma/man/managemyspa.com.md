If you do not want any personal information to be shared with our business partners or sponsors, you may opt out by sending an email to privacy@ managemyspa.com  with "OPT OUT" in the subject line.

We may also disclose your personal information in the good faith belief that we must act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the ManageMySpa Site, or the public.



### **Do I have a choice about how my information is gathered, used and distributed?**

Yes. When you log in or register with ManageMySpa, you can choose to receive newsletters, information, and e-mails from ManageMySpa and third parties. If you change your mind, you can simply update your account information on our Web site so that the information will not be sent. It's your choice.

Some of our promotions may request your e-mail address so that you can receive periodic updates about the status of the promotion. When you participate in these types of promotions, you will automatically receive promotion-related e-mail; however, you can choose the no-e-mail option that some promotions offer. Occasionally these promotion-related e-mail messages may include targeted advertisements.

While using our hosting services, you may choose to store personal information on our servers through such services. The storage and removal of such information is at your discretion.

###  **What security precautions does ManageMySpa take to protect me?**

We have security measures in place to protect your personal information, including the use of industry-standard encryption technology and internal policies and restrictions regarding the storage of and access to your personal information.

Your ManageMySpa account information and profile are password-protected so that you are the only one who has access to your personal information. You can edit your account information and profile by using your logon name and password. We recommend that you follow these guidelines to protect yourself: 

  * Do not tell anyone your password. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. 
  * Do not respond to unsolicited e-mail by giving your password, even if the e-mail claims to be from us. ManageMySpa will never ask you for your password in this way. 
  * When you are done using the ManageMySpa site, sign out of your account and close your browser window. 



No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Although we are committed to protecting your personal information, ManageMySpa cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you send to us or from our online services. Providing personal information to ManageMySpa is done at your own risk.

###  **What are cookies and how does ManageMySpa use them?**

Part of our customized service involves using “cookies” so that we can immediately recognize you, determine when you – or someone using the same browser you previously used – revisits ManageMySpa, and to provide a more personalized experience. A "cookie" is a chunk of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored by your browser on the hard drive of your computer. Your browser settings must be set to accept cookies before you can login or customize. Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to refuse them. ManageMySpa does not use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer. This policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers on the ManageMySpa Site.

ManageMySpa uses cookies to: 

  * Locate your name and account information when you log in to our Web site so that you can access your account information. When you log in, the cookie is set, and when you sign-out, the cookie is modified. 
  * Estimate the size of our audience. Each browser that accesses ManageMySpa is given a unique cookie, which is used to calculate how many people return to our Web site, compare the number of registered and unregistered visitors to our site, and use customer interests and behavior to target our advertisements. 
  * Help ManageMySpa partners track visits and complete business transactions. This information is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail". 
  * Track the way you use our promotions, contests, and sales. When a ManageMySpa hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie tracks the user's progress through the promotion (for example, entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings). 
  * Measure the traffic to various areas of the ManageMySpa Site. We measure the areas of the network of Web sites you visit and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. This research helps us understand the ways in which our customers are alike and the ways in which they differ. We may use this information to personalize the information and design in our Web site. 



You can make decisions about cookies. You can modify your browser preferences to accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you decide to reject all cookies, you might not be able to access certain areas of the ManageMySpa website or participate in ManageMySpa services that require registration to participate..

###  **What about the privacy of children?**

ManageMySpa is a general audience Web site and does not request the age of its customers. ManageMySpa does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
