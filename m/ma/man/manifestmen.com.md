Now for the legal stuff:

I. Information Collection and Management

A. Personal information

i. Information we collect

"Personally identifiable information" is information that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, email address, home or work address, or telephone number. Manifest Media, Inc. only has access to the information that you provide to us and our billing processor. For example, we cannot determine your email address unless you provide it. We cannot gain access to other information on your computer. Those who visit only public areas of the Web site (such as the "site tour") and who do not purchase goods or services do not need to, and generally do not, provide us with any personally identifiable information. Those who wish to join the site, however, or to purchase products or services or sign up for our mailing list, must provide us with enough information to enable us to process the requested transaction. This generally includes, at a minimum, personally identifiable information such as name, address, email address, and telephone number. Members also select, and thereby provide, a username and password combination.

ii. How we use the information

Your personally identifiable information is used only to process the requested transaction, and occasionally to provide you with special offers from Manifest Media, Inc.  On occasion, for example, we may send emails to introduce a product or service that we think will interest our members or viewers. Manifest Media, Inc. will never intentionally disclose any personally identifiable information to any third party, unless we are compelled to do so by law (for example, in response to a subpoena or court order), or our obligation to maintain the privacy of your information has been waived or otherwise excused by you (for example, by your filing suit against us and asserting claims against which such information would be relevant in our defense). 

B. Interactive data

i. Information we collect

Manifest Media, Inc. provides features which allow members to communicate with each other, such as a forum and Performer Chat Rooms. Chat transcripts and message board postings are backed up periodically and may be retained.

ii. How we use the information

Use of these interactive features is not monitored by Manifest Media, Inc. We do not use information posted on interactive features except as the author presumably intended; that is, as content on the Web site. We do not share user submitted information with third parties; however, any information posted is visible to other members, and is vulnerable to being copied and/or redistributed by others. Members should use reasonable caution when disclosing any personally identifiable information in any online forum. We cannot be responsible for any damages incurred as a result of such disclosure, and use of the interactive services is at the member's own risk.

iii. Opt-out policy

Members must opt-in (for example, by participating in a chat) in order for us to collect this information.

C. Click-stream data

i. Information we collect

We also collect non-personally identifiable information provided by your browser and/or our servers, such as the name and IP address of the domain from which you visited (if any), the amount of time you spent on each page and on the site as a whole, and the path you followed through the site. This sort of information is sometimes known as click-stream data.  We use this information to improve our site's performance.

II. Related Issues

A. Information security

We constantly strive to improve the security of your personally identifiable information. We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as using encryption for transmission of credit card numbers, to help us keep your information secure. 

Manifest Media does not use third-party services to provide banner advertising.

B. Children's data 

Manifest Media, Inc. Web sites are not intended for minors and do not collect any data governed by the United States Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

C. Privacy technology 

There are an increasing number of products and services available to help protect your privacy while navigating the Web. A web search will yield substantive information.

D. Notification of changes 

This privacy statement was last updated on May 01, 2008. A notice will be posted on our web site for 30 days whenever this privacy statement is changed. 

E. Questions regarding this statement

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to our Director of Member Services.
