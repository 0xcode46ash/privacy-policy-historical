# Manchester Airport : Privacy Policy

At Manchester Airport PLC (MAPLC) we are committed to protecting your privacy. We have therefore created this privacy statement in order to explain our practices for this web site and to demonstrate our commitment to you.

**Travel Partner Websites  
**MAPLC's web site contains links to other web sites where you may buy products and services. Please note that MAPLC is not responsible for the privacy practices (including the use of cookies) or the content of such other web sites.

**Data Protection Notice - Please Read  
**From this website MAPLC would like to gather certain information to use for marketing, promotional  
and statistical purposes in line with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998. However, we do not collect personal information about you when you are browsing through our site.

**What we collect  
**We will only collect personal information when you give it to us.  
If you visit our feedback area and give us feedback or feedback through the aircraft noise complaints section, your e-mail address will be used to respond to you, where you have requested a response.  
Your comments may be used to enable us to improve services.  
We may collect additional information you provide when you participate in any promotions or competitions offered by MAPLC or when giving us feedback.  
We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site use, which enables us to improve the service we provide.

**MAPLC Product Booking  
**When you make a car park or other MAPLC product booking on-line with us we collect information about each transaction but we do not store your full payment card details on our server in any way. We do, though, over a secure encrypted link pass your full card details to our 3rd party payment processor (Datacash), which processes your payment.

**Data Collection, Usage and Cookies  
**By registering on our site or by using our MAPLC product booking services available through this site you agree that MAPLC will retain the personal information which you provide will be held by MAPLC for the purpose of completing your purchase of MAPLC products.  
The use of cookies is optional. You have the option not to use MAPLC cookies by changing your browser settings, or by deleting them from your temporary Internet files.  
Cookies used on the MAPLC website do not contain personal data. The cookies contain only a unique number and, in case of multi variate testing, a number indicating which version of the website has been presented and when that occurred. There are several other cookies on this website, which are all session based and will therefore become inactive when you leave Manchester Airport's web site.  
In addition, on our behalf, Digital Analytix use cookies (processed in Digital Analytix) to recognise returning visitors and these cookies have a validity of 5 years.  
As part of the on-line booking process, MAPLC use cookies to pre-populate the entry and exit dates for your parking to make it easier for you to book next time. These cookies have a validity of 2 months.  
Finally, if you choose to login to make a booking, we will use a cookie to pre-populate your name, address and vehicle details to make it easier to complete a booking. This cookie, though, is session based so will be deleted when you exit the site. If you do not want to use cookies to pre-populate your personal information then you should choose not to login before starting a booking.

 information about MAPLC, its related companies, and their goods and services, and for general statistical purposes; and  
 online and offline marketing and promotional purposes. For example, informing you of new airline routes or developments by e-mail, or by sending you direct mail through the normal post, which contains information that may be of interest to you.
