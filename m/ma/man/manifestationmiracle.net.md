Manifestation Miracle.com uses "ClickBank", a third-party provider of e-commerce solutions, to power the Manifestation Miracle site and in doing so, collects information about users, including credit card information. When a user purchases a product from the Manifestation Miracle.com site, ClickBank provides information about the customer, including name, address and email address, to Manifestation Miracle.com.

ClickBank requests information from the user on the order form, viewed by the user as a page hosted on their ClickBank web server. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used as explained above. For example, if we have trouble processing an order, contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

Your credit card information does not pass through the Manifestation Miracle site under the terms of Manifestation Miracle.com's agreement with ClickBank. ClickBank does not share credit card information with Manifestation Miracle.com. ClickBank keeps your credit card information confidential and protects your credit card information through the use of industry-standard Secure Sockets (SSL) encryption technology.
