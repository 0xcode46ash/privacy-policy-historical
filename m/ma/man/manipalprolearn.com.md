As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information. In connection with other activities, such as utilizing online or hosted Programs and Services, Manipal may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting a form. It is optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, Manipal may ask that you provide certain personal information (as well as certain non-personal information that may be tied to personal information), such as your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), country, e-mail address, employer, job title and department, and telephone and facsimile numbers,. Depending upon the activity you intend to use on some Manipal Services and Programs that you have enrolled, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. Similarly, if you wish to delete your information that is mandatory, you will no longer be able to engage in that particular activity. 

When you use the Site and the Services, Manipal may also collect certain information about your computer to facilitate, evaluate and verify your use of the Site and the Services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, referring or exit webpages, click patterns, Session ID (a unique identifier assigned to the browser in connection to the Site), and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer. Manipal also uses such information to measure traffic patterns on the Site and usage of the Programs and Services.

If you decide to send us an electronic mail message (e-mail), the message will usually contain return e-mail address.

We may use that information in responding to your request, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. Please send us only information to help us process your request for the specified service. 

On some of our web pages, we offer interactive forms that let you voluntarily consent to submit personal information (such as your e-mail, postal correspondence address, name of your organization, telephone no.). This occurs when you are registering for online counselling, various assessment tests, discussion boards, quizzes, seminars, workshops or training sessions offered by Manipal, downloading admission forms from Manipal. In those cases, all submitted information is used only for the purposes for which it is intended and is not made available to any third party, other than specifically permitted under this Privacy Policy.

Another instance where this could occur is in conjunction with framed pages in which the URL for the pages is not visible, and the pages are hosted for Manipal Global Education by such third party vendors. For example, on the sign up pages for Student registration portal viz., http:// apply. **manipalglobal**.com/nrapp/faces/index.jsp or [http://www.manipalprolearn.com](http://www.manipalprolearn.com/) page and they are therefore governed by this Privacy Policy.

We will be sharing any of the personal information provided by you in response to any subpoenas, court orders, or legal process. 

**Invite / Referral Program:** Personal Information that users choose to provide about other individuals under the referral policy/ features for tell-a-friend on the Site or within Programs and Services, we ask to provide name and email address and phone number of such referred or your friends.

We store this information in our system for the sole purpose of sending one-time contact and tracking the success of our referral program. The friends of the users will not receive any more communication unless they choose to receive more communication or if they become a registered user of our site or upon enrollment as a student.

We may also ask you to provide information of others such as when reporting suspected piracy.

They do not collect any information other than IP addresses and behaviour associated with those IP addresses on our behalf, and we do not give any personal information to them. Third-party advertisement servers are subject to their own privacy policies. Manipal may also allow other companies to display advertisements on certain pages of the Site or within the Programs and Services.

If as a result of business transition, the users’ SPDI will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection.
