**Ordering and paying for online orders with M and M Direct is both safe and secure.** Security is one of the greatest fears when placing online orders and we as a company have invested in a totally secure and safe site for you to shop. Once you checkout, we encrypt all your details using Internet standard encryption technology (SSL).

If a site is secure a padlock will appear in the bottom right hand section of your screen when you are in the credit card entry area. Occasionally, the padlock will not be visible but the page is still secure. If you do not see the padlock, you can check by right-clicking anywhere on the page (except on an image) and select Properties. If the URL starts **https** : the **s** indicates that the page is secure.

If you do not want to place your order over the web then look and browse through the site, make a note of the items you want to order and ring our sales line on **08708 51 51 51** to place your order. It's easy!! We would strongly advise not to email an order to us as this is not secure and could be intercepted.

We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. This Privacy Policy explains how we use the information we collect about you, how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy.

 **The information we collect and how we use it**  
When you register with our website we need to know your name, e-mail address, correspondence address, contact telephone numbers and payment/credit card details.  
We gather this information to allow us to process your orders and provide you with the information/goods requested.  
From time to time we may provide your information to our customer service agencies for research and analysis purposes so that we can monitor and improve the services we provide. We or our agents and sub-contractors may contact you by post, e-mail or telephone to ask you for your feedback and comments on our services. In addition we may use and share the information (which we will keep for a reasonable period) for marketing, host mailing, list rental and profiling your preferences and occasionally as a service to our customers make our customer lists available to carefully screened companies whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you, unless you have signified to us that you do not wish us to make your details available to third parties.

 **How we protect your information**  
The Internet is not a secure medium. However we have put in place various security procedures as set out in this policy, including firewall security and password protection.  
You should be aware that information and data may be automatically collected through the use of "cookies". Cookies are small text files a website can use to recognise repeat users and allow us to observe behaviour and compile aggregate data in order to improve our website and to target its advertising. Cookies do not attach to your system or damage your files. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature, and should refer to the “Help” section of your PC operating system.

 **Sale of business**  
In the event that this business is sold or integrated with another business your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchaser and their advisers and will be passed on to the new owners of the business.

 **Updating your details**  
If any of the information that you have provided to us changes, for example if you change your e-mail address, name or payment details, please let us know the correct details by sending an e-mail to cservices@mandmdirect.com, or by sending a letter to M & M Direct Limited, Clinton Road, Leominster, Herefordshire, HR6 0SJ.

 **Disclosure of information**  
We comply with and are registered under the Data Protection laws in the United Kingdom. We take all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access to and use of your personal data.  
Our staff and those working for our agents and contractors maintain a responsibility to keep your information confidential and will only use it to offer relevant products and services related to your enquiry.

 **Your consent**  
By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this Policy. If we change our Privacy Policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the website, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it at all times. Continued use of the service will signify that you agree to any such changes.  
Owing to the global nature of the internet infrastructure, the information you provide may be transferred to companies based in countries outside the European Economic Area that do not have similar protections in place regarding your data and its use as set out in this policy. However, we have taken the steps outlined above to try to improve the security of your information, and where we pass your information to such companies (other than in transit across the internet), we will ensure that they treat your information with the same level of protection as if we were dealing with it ourselves. By submitting your information you confirm your consent to these transfers.
