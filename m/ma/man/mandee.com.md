********We are committed to protecting your privacy. At times, we may ask you to provide information about yourself. For example, some of the information collected may include name, title, address, phone number, email address, and personal information concerning your interests, occupation, gender and other demographic information.

**Contacting You Concerning Promotions and New Products**.

We will not send messages to you concerning promotions or new products or other marketing material unless you have opted-in.   Please see the sections “How Can I Opt Out” below for information on how to stop receiving our e-mail or mobile text communications. ****

**Policy on Information from Persons under the Age of 18**.

We do not seek to collect personally identifiable information from persons under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any personally identifiable information to us. If you are the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 who has provided personally identifiable information to us, please inform us by emailing Mandee at [customerservice@mandee.com](mailto:customerservice@mandee.com) or Annie Sez at [customersupport@anniesez.com](mailto:customersupport@anniesez.com), and we will remove such information from our database. ****

**How We Use Information You Submit to Us**.  
We use your information to provide services to you, including coupons, customer alerts and special offers. We may combine your personally identifying information and information about your preferences and activities with those of all or a particular group of our shoppers to prepare collective profiles of our users and their activities for our internal use. For example, we may track the number of our users who purchase certain product or use certain features on our website, or compile the total dollar amount of sales transacted in a particular geographic region or to track purchasing trends. Such information, and other information we derive from individual users’ information, allows us to continue to grow and provide you with quality information through more accurate marketing and advertising. We may also share aggregated information concerning our users, without attribution of personal information, to other companies with whom we conduct business.

We will not use or disclose your personally identifiable information, or your e-mail or mobile phone number, to any persons or entities outside of our company and our service providers, contractors, representatives and advisors, nor shall we lease, license, sublicense, rent, transfer, disclose, disseminate or otherwise grant access to such information unless: You have been given an opportunity to “opt-in” and have agreed to so opt-in to such disclosure of your information; we are required to respond to subpoena, court orders or other requirement of law which requires disclosure of your information; you have otherwise consented to provide your information to such persons or entities; or we sell or transfer substantially all of the assets of the company or a business unit of the company to another person or entity.

**How Can I “Opt-out” of Receiving Email Communications?**

We will not send e-mail messages to you if you indicate that you do not wish to receive such messages. If you do not wish to receive email messages from us, please email Mandee at  [customerservice@mandee.com](mailto:customerservice@mandee.com) or Annie Sez at [customersupport@anniesez.com](mailto:customersupport@anniesez.com).

It may take up to 10 days for mailing preference changes to take effect, and you may receive e-mail messages during this time.

The Mandee/Annie Sez Privacy Policy is governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New Jersey in the United States, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Jurisdiction for any claims arising under or out of the Policy shall lie exclusively with the state and federal courts within the State of New Jersey. If any provision of the Policy is found to be invalid by a court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any term or condition of the Policy shall not be deemed a waiver thereof and shall not prevent its later enforcement.  This Policy is subject to change without prior notice, but we will post all changes on our website, [www.mandee.com](http://www.mandee.com/); [www.anniesez.com](http://www.anniesez.com/).
