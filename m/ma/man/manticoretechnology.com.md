For visitors to the Manticore Technology website who are not existing customers, we collect non-personally identifying information such as IP address, time of visit, click-sequence, and technical information about your browser. Non-personally identifying Information that we collect about the browsing habits of our visitors is used to optimize the design of our website by understanding what content our customers are interested in.

This information includes such things as name, physical address, phone number, email address and other information for billing purposes. Current customers can update this information by logging into their Manticore account and using the appropriate section of the account management area. This information is used primarily for billing and contact purposes as it relates to the use of our products. Manticore Technology may also send current customers email newsletters and announcements about new product releases or events. Additionally, we have the ability to monitor the sessions of current Manticore customers by username so that we can gauge usage levels and reenact customer click streams for trouble shooting purposes.  
For non-Manticore customers and Manticore customers alike, we regularly track the results of email campaigns we send by monitoring email metrics such as open, click-thru, and no response rates.
