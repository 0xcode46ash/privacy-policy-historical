# Virtual Traffic Master

The Virtual Traffic Master Service  
Manticore Technology has the utmost respect for the privacy of our customers as well as their site visitors. Virtual Traffic Master (VTM) is a statistical marketing analysis tool for the Internet. It provides a service in a hosted model. This means that raw data is transmitted to our servers where it is analyzed, with results being provided online for our clients. This service does nothing different than software that our customers could buy and install on their servers. They have simply chosen our service because of its convenience, powerful analysis capabilities, and ultimate cost savings to them. 

Information Usage By Our Customers  
Our customers own the information collected using VTM in whole for the duration of our contractual agreement with them. We will not divulge to any third party, unless required by law, statistics or other data collected using the Virtual Traffic Master service. We cannot, however, make any warranty or guarantee to what our customers may do with this information. When a contract with one of our customers is terminated, VTM will keep their data for a discretionary period and then destroy it permanently. 

If you have a concern about the policy of a particular company that uses the Virtual Traffic Master service, please refer to their website for their individual privacy policy. 

Use of Personal Information  
The Virtual Traffic Master service does not attempt in any way to identify the personal identity of an individual. The service does not collect information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or social security numbers. Virtual Traffic Master analyzes and identifies statistical trends on a website. Personal identification of individuals would serve no purpose to discovering these trends. 

It should be noted however that our customers might collect and store personal information from you. Please refer to their individual websites for details on how they collect and use this information. 

Use of Cookies  
Virtual Traffic Master uses cookies only to identify unique visitors coming to a customer's site. The cookie that VTM places in your browser contains a unique identification number. By observing the patterns of many unique visitor IDs, VTM is able to generate reports for our customers, which helps them to better understand their visitors. Again, the cookie provides no way of determining the personal identity of a visitor, only that a visitor is distinct. 

IP Addresses and Domain Names  
IP Addresses and Domain Names are not useful for tracking individual users because of their tendency to be dynamic in nature. The primary use of IP Address and Domain Names is to provide an aggregated report of the domains from which significant web traffic is being driven. This is no way compromises the identity of our customers visitors. 

Data Security  
The data maintained by Virtual Traffic Master is stored on a secured server maintained by a professional hosting service.
