**Manticore Technology's Products**  
Manticore Technology has the utmost respect for the privacy of our customers as well as their site visitors. Virtual Traffic Master-Core (VTMc), Virtual Traffic Master (VTM), and Virtual Commerce Master (VCM) are statistical marketing analysis tools for the Internet that provide a service in a hosted model. This means that raw data is transmitted to our servers where it is processed and analyzed for our customers, with results being provided online. This service does nothing different than software that our customers could buy and install on their servers. They have simply chosen our service because of its convenience, powerful analysis capabilities, and ultimate cost savings to them. 

**Information Usage By Our Customers**  
Our customers own the information collected using Manticore's products. We store this information for them for the duration of our contractual agreement. We will not divulge to any third party, unless required by law, statistics or other data collected using any of our products. We cannot, however, make any warranty or guarantee to what our customers may do with this information. When a contract with one of our customers is terminated, we will keep data for a discretionary period and then destroy it permanently. 

If you have a concern about the policy of a particular company that uses Manticore's products, please refer to their website for their individual privacy policy. 

**Use of Personal Information**  
Manticore's products do not attempt in any way to identify the personal identity of an individual. The service does not collect information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or social security numbers. Our products analyze data to identify statistical trends. Personal identification of individuals would serve no purpose to discovering these trends. 

It should be noted however that our customers might collect and store personal information from you. Please refer to their individual websites for details on how they collect and use this information. 

**Use of Cookies**  
Manticore's products use cookies only to identify the uniqueness, not the identity, of a visitor using our customer's site. The cookie that we place in your browser contains a unique identification number. By observing the pattern of many unique ID numbers, Manticore is able to generate reports that help our customers better understand their visitors. Again, the cookie provides no way of determining the personal identity of a visitor, only that a visitor is distinct. 

**IP Addresses and Domain Names**  
IP Addresses and Domain Names are not useful for tracking individual users because of their tendency to be dynamic in nature. The primary use of IP Address and Domain Names is to provide an aggregated report of the domains from which significant web traffic is being driven. 

**Data Security**  
The data maintained by Manticore Technology is stored on a secured server maintained by trained, certified IT professionals. 

**Contact**
