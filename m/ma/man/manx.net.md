# Privacy Policy :: Manx Telecom

Manx Telecom will not pass your personal details to anyone outside of Manx Telecom. Any information given by Manx Telecom to companies felt by Manx Telecom to be reputable will only be "aggregated" statistics. This means that none of the data includes information that would enable you or any other individual to be identified.

Should Manx Telecom's policy ever change, we will inform you and ask your permission once again before sharing any information.

## How does Manx Telecom protect your data?

When you register details with us, make an order or access account details, we use a secure server. Any data you give us is encrypted using a 'Secure Socket Layer' (SSL) session. SSL is an industry standard and is one of the best ways to ensure Internet messages are not intercepted. You should be aware, however, that older browsers cannot use SSL. To be sure, you will need Netscape version 4.05 or Microsoft Internet Explorer browsers, version 4 or above.

If you are required to send us your credit or debit card information, your details will be encrypted twice - once before transmission then again by the secure connection during transmission. All credit and debit card details are stored in encrypted form on our servers and can only be viewed by employees with the correct security clearance.

Over and above what Manx Telecom do to safeguard your privacy and security, there are a number of things you can do to protect yourself from Internet fraud:

Choose a password you can remember but others will not guess, and if you do write it down, keep it somewhere safe and secure.

When you have finished your session on Manx-Telecom.com, make sure that you prevent your details being seen by anyone that you do not wish to see them. So, if you have registered and logged in, remember to log off. Clear any 'cache' so there is no record of any transactions left on screen - both Netscape and Internet Explorer let you do this. We also recommend you then close your browser so any history of the session is cleared. As an extra precaution, your session on Manx Telecom's website will 'time out' if you have not used the site for 30 minutes.

## Use of Cookies

Manx Telecoms website does not use cookies or record any information on your PC about how you access our website.

## Email addresses

At Manx Telecom we respect the privacy of personal e-mail accounts and we store your e-mail addresses just as securely as other personal information on Manx-Telecom.com. We will not send you unwanted e-mail messages or junk mail, and your details will not be passed to ANY organisation beyond Manx Telecom without your explicit permission.

However, we will use e-mail to send you messages about outstanding orders, faults and service issues. We may also use e-mail to keep you up to date with news about your current services, as well as anything you show an interest in, either online, or through other contact with Manx Telecom.

If you do not want to be kept informed in this way by e-mail, please let us know. You can do this by ticking the relevant box where your email address is stored in your Manx-Telecom.com personal profile.
