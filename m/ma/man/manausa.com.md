**What personally identifiable information will Homes.com collect from me?**

Information is collected in several different ways and for a variety of different reasons.  For example, personal information is collected when you register for Homes.com's personalization services.  During such registration, Homes.com asks for your name, e-mail address, ZIP code, and other information.  The more information you provide, the better we are able to customize our services for you, allowing you to fully benefit from our many offerings.

We may also ask you for personal information when you make a purchase from us or one of our service partners; when you enter a sweepstakes or other promotion sponsored by Homes.com or our service partners; or when requesting specific services.  Any transactions that require the collection of sensitive data such as your credit card information will be done over fully secured servers using sophisticated encryption technology for your protection.

Any page on Homes.com that includes a request for personal information will include a link to this Privacy Policy.

**How does Homes.com use cookies?**

A cookie consists of a data file sent to your browser from a web server, which is then stored on your computer's hard drive.  Cookies allow us to store and occasionally track information about you and your use of our site. Your browser can be configured not to accept cookies; however, all Homes.com services that require registration or are customizable require cookies for delivery.  At Homes.com, we use cookies to:

Tell us who you are and allow us to access your account information to deliver personalized services.  This cookie is sent to your browser when you register for personalization services and when you log in.

Store your ZIP code, so that we can deliver services and information that are specific to your location, such as yellow pages, news, and weather.

To facilitate your transactions with our service partners, including processing any items you wish to purchase, and tracking your visits to and business at their areas of the Homes.com web site.

Measure our audience size and analyze traffic patterns on Homes.com. This allows us to better understand how our site is being used both individually and in the aggregate, and to improve the content and services we offer, including personalization, content, advertising, and promotions.

Advertising networks who serve ads on Homes.com may also serve cookies.  In addition, Homes.com collects IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregated information (that does not identify individual users) to our advertisers.  Homes.com email accounts also include IP addresses in outgoing mail headers.

**Who is collecting my personal information?**

When you provide Homes.com with your personal information, you are providing it to us alone, unless otherwise explicitly stated.  For example, some services, such as mortgages or home improvement contracting, are offered in conjunction with our service partners.  To provide such cobranded service, it is necessary that we provide them with required personal information about you.  If you do not want your information shared with such partners, you can decline to use that particular service.

Some promotions or services may include the collection of personal information that may be shared with sponsors or other companies.  For example, information collected from you when requesting a free copy of a magazine may be shared with third-party businesses who may have services of interest to you. This will be explicitly stated to you at the time you fill out the magazine request.  You can decide not to complete your request for such a magazine if you do not want your data shared.

In addition, Homes.com uses a third party, DoubleClick, to serve the advertisements that you see on the pages of our Web site. This includes the use of cookies to gather information that is then used to target advertisements to your individual interests. DoubleClick may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site. If you would like to know more about DoubleClick's information-gathering practices and opt-out procedures, visit [www.doubleclick.net/naiprivacy](http://www.doubleclick.net/naiprivacy).

Homes.com advertisers and web sites that have links on our site may also collected personally identifiable information about you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of those sites.

**Who will Homes.com share my information with?**

Homes.com will not disclose personally identifiable information about you unless we have your explicit permission or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.  Your information may be shared with the following:

  * _Homes.com business partners and sponsors._   The nature of disclosure of your personal information to business partners and sponsors will be described to you prior to collection and transfer of such data.
  * _Service and Product Partners for online transactions._ When making a purchase from a store hosted by or framed by Homes.com, the information obtained from you to facilitate the transaction will be shared with Homes.com's service partner.  This includes your credit card number and required contact information.  Such data will be collected and shared using secure servers and sophisticated encryption technology for your protection.  Homes.com's service and product partners have separate data collection and privacy policies, which should be reviewed on their individual sites.
  * _Prospective partners, advertisers, and other parties._ To describe and promote our offerings to prospective partners, advertisers, investors, and other parties, Homes.com may share aggregated data regarding our users.  Such data in no way identify individual users, and are collected and distributed to provide profiles of Homes.com's user base (e.g., 35% of our users are currently homeowners), and for other lawful purposes.



**What control do I have over the collection, use, and distribution of my personal information?**

The collection and use of your personally identifiable information by Homes.com, including its distribution to other parties, is permission-based, meaning that such information will be collected and used with your knowledge, and will only be shared with other parties with your explicit consent. If you do not want your information shared, you will have the ability to opt out of  a particular service or to not participate in particular promotions.

Homes.com may, from time to time, issue newsletters to its registered members via email.  Such newsletters may include banner advertising and promotional/product offerings from Homes.com business and service partners, some of which may be specifically targeted at you based on the personal information we have collected. If you do not wish to receive such emails, simply tell us when you register for Homes.com's personalization services.  You can update your profile, including changing your newsletter receipt status, at any time by accessing the Preferences section of your personalized Homes.com account.

By modifying your browser preferences, you can also control the way you handle cookies, including the ability to accept or reject all cookies. However, rejecting cookies from Homes.com means that we will be unable to provide you with our registered, services, including personalization, email, and calendaring.  You will still, however, be able to engage in online transactions facilitated via Homes.com.

**Will I be able to access and update my personal information?**

You may edit your personally identifiable information on Homes.com by accessing the Preferences section of your personalization account, which you can access at any time by using your Homes.com User ID and password (if you choose to disable login on your account, you will not be asked for this information prior to accessing your account, although access will be denied to any user other than you).

You can also deactivate your account at any time, again using the Preferences section of your personalization account.  However, doing so will prevent you from accessing all personalized Homes.com services.

If you have forgotten your Homes.com password, [click here](http://www.homes.com/My/EmailReminder.cfm) for a reminder or to request a new one.

**How does Homes.com protect my sensitive financial information, such as credit card numbers?**

There are several areas on Homes.com that require sensitive financial and personal information to complete a transaction.  This includes mortgage services involving personal finances, product transactions requiring credit cards, and more.  Any time we ask for sensitive information like a credit card number, such information will be transmitted using industry-standard, secure socket layer (SSL) encryption.
