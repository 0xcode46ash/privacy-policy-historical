# Our Cookie and Privacy Policy | made.com

First things first, we promise to keep all of your personal information safe. It’s kept on a secure server and fully complies with all of the relevant consumer laws.

Like all sites we sometimes put cookies on your computer or handheld device – they’re small data files that mean we can see what you’ve put in your shopping cart and allow you to order on our site. Some collect information on where you’re browsing on our site, but like your personal information, we keep it all confidential.

## What kind of things do we collect?

In order to make sure everything runs smoothly, we might collect a few bits of information like:

  1. Your name, address, email address, phone number when you contact customer services, enter a competition or vote for a product, and your credit card details when you order.
  2. Your user name, password, account details and a record of your product selection.
  3. Where you’ve come from and what browser you use, what ads you’ve clicked on, which pages you’ve looked at and your favourite search terms (even if you haven’t registered with us).



## What do we use this information for?

We hate spam and we reckon you do too. That’s why we collect information on your browsing habits, so that we can improve our service and make it easier to find the bits you really want to see. It helps us to improve our:

  1. Order process
  2. Customer service
  3. Navigation experience
  4. Advertising 



## How do we keep our information safe?

We use one of the most powerful security systems available on the internet. That means that when you place an order or access your personal information we transmit the sensitive data using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which then gets encrypted into our database. There’s only a handful of people with special access to this information and they’re required to keep it confidential by law. And after your transaction is complete we don’t store any private information on our servers.

## How do cookies fit into this?

A cookie is a small piece of information which gets stored on your computer’s hard drive. It allows you to browse, shop and order on our site. It also means we can continue to improve your experience on MADE.COM.

Cookies helps us gather some of the information that we talked about above. But it’s mainly things like which products you put into your basket so we can save them for your future visits. You’re welcome to disable cookies at any time, but it might limit your use and enjoyment of our site.

Sometimes we might ask a third party to help us understand this information, but it’ll only ever be used to help us conduct and improve our business.

## Do we share our information?

We never share truly personal or sensitive data with anyone unless directed to by the police, government or other regulatory official.

We only share specific bits of your personal information (like your address) with our trusted partners (like our delivery company) so they can help us operate our site or conduct our business – but they have agreed to keep your information confidential too.

Sometimes we share non-identifiable visitor information (like which pages are most clicked on) with other parties for things like marketing or advertising.

The most important thing to know is that we’ll never share your information without your consent (in compliance with the relevant regulations).

## The Legal Bits

  1. Occasionally we use customer lists from other companies so that we can invite them to enjoy MADE.COM. We only ever use lists of people who have agreed to be contacted by email and whenever we do contact them, there’ll always be an ‘opt out’ option.
  2. By agreeing to our privacy policy it means that you give us consent to contact you by telephone, email or in writing under the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. (Again, you’ll be able to opt out of this should you wish)
  3. This privacy policy only applies to information we’ve collected on our website and not to info collected offline.
  4. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we’ll update it here. It was last updated on 22/05/2013.
