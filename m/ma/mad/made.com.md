Pixel tracking is the most common type of tracking as it is quick to implement and provides instant data for advertisers and publishers. It consists of two elements:  
Redirect page: All Tradedoubler traffic will pass through this page before directing the user onto the requested page on your site. This page will handle Tradedoubler's unique tracking identifier (TDUID) and cookie setting tasks.  
Confirmation page: The tracking pixel (also known as the tracking or conversion tag) must be displayed on the confirmation page. This is the page immediately after the transaction has been completed (e.g. confirming the order has been placed).
