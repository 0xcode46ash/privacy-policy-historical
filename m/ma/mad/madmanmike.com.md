**PRIVACY POLICY**

**DJ Service:** all information is kept confidential, not sold nor given to third parties. One exception - when someone knowingly offers or grants permission to be used as a reference for other people considering using Mike's DJ service, information given is limited to a contact phone number and/or mailing address.

If there will be celebrities or VIPs at private events for which Mike is the DJ, their information is kept confidential. For the record, everybody's info and everything that happens at those events is kept confidential before, during _AND_ after.

**Online Transactions:** for this website, these are done using PayPal or other verified secure services. Mike does not see credit card or bank account numbers. Information such as mailing and e-mail addresses are kept confidential, not sold nor given to third parties.

If using different websites (such as Mike's resources links - not this website), Mike does not see nor collect personal information that people may supply and is not responsible for other websites privacy policies.

**E-mail Lists and Spam:** This website is passionately anti-spam. Mike does not automatically collect and add e-mail addresses to any e-mailing lists, his or others. Nor does he purchase e-mail addresses from third parties.

If you have received spam from Mike's e-mail addresses, it wasn't from Mike. It was some lowlife stealing Mike's e-mail address which can be proved by checking the senders IP addresses. Mike would also appreciate the prosecution of those who are "phishing" (fraudulently using, stealing) his e-mail addresses.

**Hidden Pop-Ups/Pop-Unders:** None. This website does not use them. As a matter of fact, there are NO advertising pop-ups/unders of any kind on this site!

**The Bottom Line:** Information you give to Mike, stays with Mike.

**BOOKING POLICY**

How far in advance do you need to book?   
It is impossible to say. Your event date might remain available up to the last minute or someone could have booked it while you're reading this. There is no good way to answer that question. Thus, Mike's booking policy.

Mike's Booking Policy:   
He uses the "first person to put down a deposit books me for their event" booking policy that is fair for everyone involved. He never uses the marketing gimmick of saying that there are many people looking at a date so you better book now. Even when it is true, it would still sound like a tacky high pressure sales pitch and Mike is not a high pressure guy.

General Advice: as soon as possible after you have decided to hire (book) Mike, check his posted [schedule](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614165536id_/http%3A//madmanmike.com/schedule.html). If still available, [contact him](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614165536id_/http%3A//madmanmike.com/hire_mike.html#contact) and state that you want to book him for your event.
