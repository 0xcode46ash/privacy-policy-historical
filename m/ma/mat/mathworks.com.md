Privacy Policy for www.mathworks.com  


The MathWorks has a privacy policy to demonstrate our concerns about your privacy. We believe it is your right to know what information we collect, how we use it, and what your options are for its use. Below you can find details about:

1\. How we use and collect your information  
2\. How we protect your order information  
3\. How to remove or update your information   
4\. How your information submitted to MATLAB Central may be used

1\. How we use and collect your information

**We will not sell or rent your personal contact information to other companies. We will not disclose your personal contact information to other companies, except in the limited manner and for the limited purposes described below.** The MathWorks Web site has several forms that may require you to provide your name, mailing address, phone and fax number, e-mail address, or payment information. We use this contact information to send promotional material about our company and products, and, in some cases, on behalf of related third party products and services. If you have purchased our software or requested information, we may use this information to notify you of new products, updates, or other information related to your purchases. You may choose not to receive this additional information (see "How to remove or update your information", below). 

  


The MathWorks uses current and past user information internally within The MathWorks and with its subsidiaries, partners, service providers, and authorized distributors in order to provide users with support, service, promotional and/or other product information. The MathWorks may release current or past user information to third parties for limited purposes in the event The MathWorks believes that usage is (i) in violation of the terms and conditions of use of The MathWorks web site; (ii) used to commit unlawful acts; and/or (iii) is required to be disclosed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or with a court or administrative order. The MathWorks may also disclose aggregate information to third parties.

The MathWorks Store uses an order form to collect contact information and payment information (such as credit card numbers). The contact information is used to ship your order, to send you promotional material about our company, or, if necessary, to get in touch with you. The payment information is only used to bill you for the products you ordered or to process returns (see "How we protect your order information" to learn how your privacy is protected during online transactions).

Important Note: The MathWorks web site contains links to other sites such as universities and other businesses. If you link to one of those sites, please note that we do not control their privacy practices. Therefore, we urge you to learn about their privacy practices before leaving your contact information with them.  


**IP addresses and cookies.** We use your IP address to administer our Web site and, occasionally, to help diagnose problems with our server. We also use it to gather broad demographic information and count the number of visits to the Web site. The MathWorks uses this nonpersonal information about users to track the URL that the user has come from (whether this URL is on The MathWorks Web site or not), the URL that the user goes to next (if the URL is on The MathWorks Web site), the Internet browser being used, the type of operating system used, the user's web server location, and the user's IP address. The MathWorks may use such nonpersonal information for purposes including, but not limited to, improving the content of its Web site, and for marketing and advertising research.

A text file, known as a cookie, is created when you login to the MATLAB®Access area of the Web site. The cookie pre-populates forms for your convenience, plus it enables you to look up your license information, get quotes, etc. You have two choices as to the type of cookie used, either a transient or a permanent cookie. Neither type of cookie saves any personal information to your hard drive. If you choose the option "Remember my login info", a permanent cookie will be saved to your hard drive. This cookie contains a simple encrypted code which is decrypted by our web server every time you enter the Access area from your computer. 

2\. How we protect your information 

This MathWorks Store has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the order information under our control. We use industry standard security measures called SSL encryption. Encryption helps protect your credit card number and personal information by scrambling the data in transit to The MathWorks Store. We encrypt every order. If you would prefer to give your information by telephone, you may call 508-647-7000.

3\. How to remove and/or update your information
