The MathWorks has a privacy policy to demonstrate our concerns about your privacy. We believe it is your right to know what information we collect, how we use it, and what your options are for its use. Below you can find details about:

1\. How we use and collect your information

1\. How we use and collect your information

**We will not sell or rent your personal contact information to other companies. We will not disclose your personal contact information to other companies, except in the limited manner and for the limited purposes described below.** The MathWorks Web site has several forms that may require you to provide your name, mailing address, phone and fax number, e-mail address, or payment information. We use this contact information to send promotional material about our company and products, and, in some cases, on behalf of related third party products and services. If you have purchased our software or requested information, we may use this information to notify you of new products, updates, or other information related to your purchases. You may choose not to receive this additional information (see "How to remove or update your information", below). 

  


The MathWorks uses current and past user information internally within The MathWorks and with its subsidiaries, partners, service providers, and authorized distributors in order to provide users with support, service, promotional and/or other product information. The MathWorks may release current or past user information to third parties for limited purposes in the event The MathWorks believes that usage is (i) in violation of the terms and conditions of use of The MathWorks Web site; (ii) used to commit unlawful acts; and/or (iii) is required to be disclosed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or with a court or administrative order. The MathWorks may also disclose aggregate information to third parties.

The MathWorks Store uses an order form to collect contact information and payment information (such as credit card numbers). The contact information is used to ship your order, to send you promotional material about our company, or, if necessary, to get in touch with you. The payment information is only used to bill you for the products you ordered or to process returns (see "How we protect your order information" to learn how your privacy is protected during online transactions).

Important Note: The MathWorks Web site contains links to other sites such as universities and other businesses. If you link to one of those sites, please note that we do not control their privacy practices. Therefore, we urge you to learn about their privacy practices before leaving your contact information with them.
