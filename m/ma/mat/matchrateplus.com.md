We use this information to send updates about our company and will contact you if requested or necessary. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. We also track browser types to help us understand our visitors’ needs related to our website design. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. When you enter a contest or other promotional features we run for Agents from time to time, we ask for information such as your name, mailing address, daytime phone number and email address, so we can administer the contest and contact you to receive feedback regarding our product.

We use this information for promotion, contact, or support purposes.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter whether it is a promotional, support, or other related communication, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter.

We offer an opportunity to opt-out of promotional, support, and Agent related communication emails, by clicking on the unsubscribe link on the emails. Or, if it’s easier for you to write a letter to inform us that you’d like to unsubscribe from our newsletters, which will effectively remove you from MatchRatePLUS.com and our Agent program, you can write to us using a red crayon:
