**About Match.Com and the Information We Collect**

Match.com is an online matchmaking service designed to provide an easy way for our members to meet each other on the Web. To accomplish this, our members create their own unique profile and our matching technology provides them matches based on their pre-selected criteria. In order to do this we must ask for certain personal information. None of the information we gather can be used by the public (visitors, other members, or anyone not employed by Match.com or the financial institutions used to process membership charges) to identify specific individuals. 

We are a membership-based service. We collect credit card, address, or bank information only from those who choose to join. All visitors to our site may browse the site, search the ads and view any articles or features our site has to offer without entering any personal information.
