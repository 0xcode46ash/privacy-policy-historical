##  Information Collection and Use 

Mathsisfun.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Mathsisfun.com collects only enough information from our users to provide basic functionality and security, at several different points on our website. 

##  Cookies 

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer containing information about the user's visit. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. 

## Advertisers

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. 

## Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

##  Links to Other Sites 

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that mathsisfun.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

## Membership

If a user elects to become a member (for example to save work between sessions) we ask for a "username" (not a real name) and an email address. mathsisfun.com stores this information for the sole purpose of handling user-specific information, responding to a specific request, protecting individual safety, or to protect the security or integrity of the website. This information is not made public or disclosed to third parties. 

## Security 

As mathsisfun.com is a free information only service and sells no products directly there is no secure server connection. At no time will mathsisfun.com directly request address or payment details. However, some partner sites do sell direct. Where possible it has been checked that these sites are using a secure server. Please check as mathsisfun.com cannot be responsible for insecure transactions from other web sites. 

##  Notification of Changes 

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will notify users on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email if possible. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
