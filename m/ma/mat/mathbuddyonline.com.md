# Math Buddy Online - Privacy Policy

**1) What information does Math Buddy gather/track and how is it used?**

PERSONAL INFORMATION: Because of the nature of our product, we must collect personal information from users during the registration process, including (at minimum) first & last names, email address and a password. 

Math Buddy LLC has partnered with Paypal for payment processing. When a user registers online for a free trial of the service, they enter their credit card information using the secure payment gateway powered by PayPal. 

The credit card information supplied with PayPal is used to establish your subscription with us should you decide to continue the service after the free trial has ended. **Math Buddy LLC has no access to the credit card information entered by the user.**

Your email address may be used to send you periodic newsletters from Math Buddy LLC. Users can opt out of promotional emails at anytime, but will still receive communications such as receipts, confirmation emails and customer service updates that are considered necessary to provide the service to you.

Math Buddy LLC does not see the cookie; we only include the Web beacon on our page, which results in a request to the partner's servers from the customer browser. We have no control over their use of the cookie after it is placed on our site.
