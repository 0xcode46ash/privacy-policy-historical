# Mattamy Homes Privacy Policy

Introduction 

The following Privacy Policy outlines the privacy rules to which Mattamy Homes and its employees are subject.

Part (A) sets out Mattamy Homes’ policy for the treatment of the personal information of its customers and potential customers. Mattamy employees are expected to follow the rules contained within the Code. Questions of specific application may be addressed to an employee’s immediate supervisor. Part (B) describes Mattamy Homes policy for the treatment of the personal information of its employees, including what employee information is used for and how employee’s may access their personal information. 

Part (A) Customer Personal Information 

i) General Overview 

Mattamy Homes is subject to Canada’s privacy legislation, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”). The Act imposes rules on how Mattamy Homes may collect, use and disclose the personal information of its customers and potential customers. It also imposes rules governing the security, retention, accuracy and access to customer personal information. 

ii) What Is Personal Information? 

Personal Information is information that identifies an individual and relates specifically to that individual. It can include a (potential) customer’s home address, telephone number, or simply information regarding their interest in or purchase of aMattamy home. 

Personal information does not include the name, business telephone number or business address of an employee of another organization (ie “business card information”). This information may be used or disclosed without consent. 

iii) What Restrictions Are Placed on the Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information? 

Generally speaking Mattamy Homes may only collect, use or disclose a customer’s or prospective customer’s personal information if the (prospective) customer has consented to the particular purpose for its use or disclosure (there are some limited exceptions that are normally not applicable to day-to-day business operations). Consent will normally be required to be express from the (potential) customer. However in appropriate circumstances involving less sensitive information, consent may be implied. 

Mattamy Homes generally obtains consent by printing a notice on our data collection forms and website identifying the purposes for which personal information gathered from the (potential) customer will be used or disclosed. Through the filling out of the data collection form, Mattamy Homes obtains the consent of the (potential) customer to use or disclose the personal information for the stated purpose on the form. 

An example might be a web page that indicates that information supplied by a potential customer will be used to provide the individual with information about Mattamy Homes property developments.

If information is to be used or disclosed for a purpose not identified to the (potential) customer, Mattamy Homes is normally obligated to communicate that additional purpose and obtain additional consent. The law restricts Mattamy Homes to collecting only personal information necessary to comply with the stated purposes (ie facilitating the transaction with a customer or potential customer including a sale of business or communication of products and services or satisfaction surveys).

Rule #1 Subject to a few exceptions, the personal information of customers and prospective customers should not be used by employees or disclosed outside the company unless consistent with the purposes to which the customer has consented. Where it is unclear if consent is present for a particular use or disclosure, employess shall seek clarification from their manager. 

Rule #2 Employees are expected to notify their Manager immediately of any unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information of which they become aware.

iv) What Are the Rules Governing Security of Personal Information? 

According to PIPEDA Mattamy Homes is required to implement security measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information. Customer and prospective customer personal information is kept in a secure area in Mattamy Homes offices. Access to such information is restricted to those employees authorized to use the information. 

Rule #3 Employees must not access customer/ prospective customer files without appropriate authorization from their supervisor/manager. 

Rule #4 Information properly accessed for authorized purposes should be immediately returned to its secured storage area after its use and not left unattended in a non-secure area. Employees should immediately report any loss, theft, unauthorized use, disclosure, copying or destruction of customer/prospective customer personal information to their supervisor.

v) What Are the Rules Governing Accuracy of Personal Information? 

Under the law, Mattamy Homes must keep personal information as accurate and up to date as is necessary for the purposes for which it has been collected. Any inaccuracies discovered should be corrected promptly. Notice must also be given to any person or organization holding the information on Mattamy Homes’ behalf to ensure correction. 

Rule #5 Where employees become aware that (prospective customer) personal information maintained in Mattamy Homes’ is inaccurate, notice should be provided to their supervisor/manager in order that the information may be corrected.

vi) What are the Rules Governing Retention of Personal Information?

Under the law, Mattamy Homes is obliged to retain personal information about its customers or prospective customers only as is long as is necessary to meet the purposes for which it was collected. 

In addition Mattamy Homes may not destroy personal information if a (potential) customer has requested access to it until after the access process (and any right of appeal regarding an access decision) has been completed. 

Rule #6 Employees who are aware that information is subject to an access request shall not alter, amend or destroy such information until authorization is received from their supervisor/manager.

vii) Challenging Compliance

Under the law, members of the public may raise concerns or complaints about Mattamy Homes’ privacy practices. The company is obliged to respond to such complaints in a timely fashion. 

Rule #7 Any inquiries about Mattamy Homes’ privacy practices that cannot be answered by reference to our privacy policy should be referred to the Chief Privacy Officer. Similarly, all complaints about Mattamy Homes’ privacy practices should be forwarded to the Chief Privacy Officer.

viii) Access

The law normally permits customers or potential customers to access their own personal information in the custody or control of Mattamy Homes. Normally, Mattamy Homes is required to respond to such requests (either denying or granting access) within 30 days of receiving the request. In appropriate circumstances Mattamy Homes may charge a reasonable fee for responding to the request.

Rule #8 Any requests to access personal information in the custody or control of Mattamy Homes by a member of the public should be immediately referred to the Chief Privacy Officer for response.

Summary of Rules 

All Mattamy employees are expected to comply with the eight rules set out above. 

Breaches of the policy may lead to corrective or disciplinary action. Employees with questions regarding the application of the policy should contact their immediate supervisor.

PART (B) Employee Personal Information 

The second portion of Mattamy Homes’ privacy policy deals with personal information collected by Mattamy Homes about its staff in order to administer the employment relationship. While the matter is still to be legally determined, it is very unlikely that PIPEDA applies to personal information used in the employment context. Nevertheless, Mattamy Homes believes it appropriate to treat employment records confidentially. The companies privacy practices reflect PIPEDA principals and are described below.

Obtaining and Verifying Your Personal Information 

Mattamy obtains personal information about its employees primarily for administration of the employment relationship including the following purposes:

  * to make informed decisions on hiring, transfers or promotions
  * benefits administration including establishment of the employee and other beneficiaries under group benefits as well as claims management
  * service recognition
  * performance evaluation, incident investigation, attendance management workplace accommodation ,scheduling, counseling and corrective action
  * pension administration
  * payroll administration



From time to time information necessary to perform employment contract administration may be disclosed to an authorized third-party service provider (i.e., group benefits insurer or payroll administrator). If employees have any questions with respect to use or disclosure of their personal information, they should notify Human Resources. 

Accessing Personal Information 

If employees want to review or verify their personal information or find out to whom the company has disclosed it, they should contact Human Resources.

At that time, specific information will be required to enable the provision of the personal information. Normally requests will be responded to within 30 days, depending on the nature and complexity of the request.

There may be instances where the company is not able to provide the personal information held about an employee.  
Some of these instances include when the information:

  * contains references to the personal information of others;
  * is subject to a legal privilege;
  * contains proprietary information that is confidential to Mattamy Homes;
  * has already been destroyed due to legal requirements or because it was no longer needed for the purposes for which it was initially collected; or
  * cannot be disclosed for legal reasons.



If employee personal information cannot be accessed, the company will always explain the reasons why.

Keeping Employees’ Personal Information Accurate 

Mattamy is committed to maintaining the accuracy of employee personal information for as long as it is being used for the purposes it was collected. Employees play an important role in keeping this information current. Should it be discovered that amendments to employee personal information are required, please advise Human Resources immediately. The company will endeavor to advise others of any important amendments to employee information which we may have released to them. 

If the company does not agree to make the amendments that have been requested, employees may challenge the decision. The company will make a record of this challenge and, if necessary, disclose the challenge to third parties who also possess the personal information.

Controls on Releasing Employee Personal Information

Mattamy has a strict policy of not releasing personal information about its employees without their consent other than:

  * Information necessary for authorized service providers to perform employment-related tasks (such as payroll and benefits administration).
  * Information the company is required to disclose by law (including a subpoena or court order).



Safeguarding Employee Personal Information 

Employees’ personal information is secure within the Payroll and Human Resources Departments. The company has comprehensive security controls to protect against unauthorized use, alteration, duplication, destruction, disclosure, loss or theft of, or unauthorized access to, employee personal information.

Options Available to Employees Regarding Their Personal Information 

Employees’ may choose not to provide the company with some or all of their personal information. Employees may also withdraw their consent to the company’s use of their personal information. Where legal requirements permit, the company will cease the use or disclosure of employee personal information. However, depending on the circumstances this may lead to an inability to provide the employee with an employment-related service or to continue with the employment relationship.

Equal Housing Opportunity 

All information provided by Mattamy Homes is subject to the Federal Fair Housing Act, which makes it illegal to advertise:

“any preference, limitation, or discrimination because of race or color, national origin, religion, gender, familial status or handicap, or an intention to make any such preference, limitation, or discrimination.”

Please note your state or local jurisdiction may impose additional requirements that may add prohibitions against discrimination based on age, parental status, sexual orientation, political ideology, financial status, and the like.

Furthermore, Mattamy Homes is pledged to the letter and spirit of the United States policy for the achievement of equal housing opportunity throughout the nation.

In Summary 

Mattamy takes its responsibility to protect the confidentiality of its employees’ personal information very seriously.
