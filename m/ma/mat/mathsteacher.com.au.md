Privacy Statement

mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.  The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the [www.mathsteacher.com](http://www.mathsteacher.com/), [www.mathsteacher.com.au](http://www.mathsteacher.com.au/), [www.mathssoftware.co.nz](http://www.mathssoftware.co.nz/), [www.mathematicssoftware.co.uk](http://www.mathematicssoftware.co.uk/), [www.mathsoftware.biz](http://www.mathsoftware.biz/), [www.mathssoftware.co.za](http://www.mathssoftware.co.za/) and [www.mathsoftware.in](http://www.mathsoftware.in/) Websites ("the mathsteacher Websites"). 

mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd may use technology to monitor traffic through the mathsteacher Websites to gather broad information about how visitors are using the mathsteacher Websites.  This information is used to improve the experience for the visitors.

The mathsteacher Websites may contain links to other Websites.  mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Websites.

The mathsteacher Websites direct visitors who request a licence from mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd for our software to order forms on the mathsteacher.com Website.  All information collected is necessary to fulfil our licensing process.  We may use the information collected on the order form to verify the identity of the person requesting the licence to protect our company from fraudulent orders.  Contact information from the order form is used to fulfil the order.  The licensee's contact information is used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary such as to inform the licensee of an unanticipated delay in fulfilling the delivery process.

Internet orders require the processing of either MasterCard, VISA or American Express credit card details.  mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd secures transactions with the Internet standard for encryption, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).  SSL uses encryption to ensure all information shared between a computer and a Website is protected from outside observation or interference.  After filling in an order form and pressing the "Pay by Credit Card" button, the credit card details are securely transmitted in real time to the National Australia Bank and processed behind its firewall.  National Australia Bank approves or declines the credit card details in real time (in approximately 6 seconds).   mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd will then process all approved transactions in accordance with its licensing process.  For security reasons, the National Australia Bank does not provide mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd with full credit card details (i.e. only 9 of the 16 digits of the credit card number is provided).

mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd may aggregate demographic information for internal use to analyse its performance.  It will not share any information with third parties that could be used to identify individual users of the mathsteacher Websites.

Visitors to the mathsteacher Websites may be provided with the opportunity to receive email updates about future software or reminders about licensing our software through check boxes or feedback forms.  mathsteacher.com Pty Ltd requires you to willingly opt-in before receiving any such emails.
