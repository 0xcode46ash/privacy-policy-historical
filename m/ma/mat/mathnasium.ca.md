# Our Privacy Policy | Mathnasium.com

1\. Introduction  
Mathnasium LLC, a California limited liability company (“Mathnasium”), respects your privacy. This policy states how we try to protect the privacy of your personal information that we may obtain from your use of this website (“Site”). If there is any part of this policy you do not agree with, or if you do not think this policy provides you enough protection, you should not use or visit this Site. By providing your personal information, you are consenting to its collection, use and disclosure according to our Privacy Policy. 

2\. Information Gathering Practices  
Here is a description of our information gathering practices for this Site: 

You can visit www.Mathnasium.com without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself or you can choose to provide information about yourself. Our site uses a request form and email to gather information. We collect contact information like your name, address, phone, and email address that you voluntarily give us. 

We use cookies. A cookie is a small data file that a website can place on your computer for record-keeping, administration, or to customize your experience. Cookies allow us to enhance your experience on our website. You may block or remove cookies on your computer by following the instructions on your web browser. 

When you visit our site, we obtain information like the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the IP (internet protocol) address of the computer you use, the browser and software you use, your computer operating system, the type and name of your ISP (internet service provider), what pages of our site you visit, the order of those pages, and the amount of time you spend on each page. 

3\. How We Use Information You Provide   
If you choose to give us information, we may share it with one or more of our franchisees, so that they can provide you with information on services and programs they offer. Mathnasium franchises are independently owned and operated. As a result, Mathnasium cannot guarantee that every franchise will comply with this Privacy Policy, but we will make an effort to require that franchises comply. 

We could use your IP address to help us identify you and gather information for statistical purposes. 

We could share information among Mathnasium-affiliated companies. This means other companies that fully or partly own, are owned by, or have common ownership or similar kinds of ownership affiliation with Mathnasium. 

We do not sell, trade or transfer information to others outside the Mathnasium family, except as is disclosed in this policy. 

We could hire outside companies or staff from affiliated Mathnasium companies, to provide services for our website. They may have access to information you provide us, but only the information they would need to perform their functions. These companies would be required to abide by Mathnasium’s Privacy Policy. 

We reserve the right to use or disclose information if we have a good faith belief that doing so is to satisfy a law, regulation or legal request, subpoena, court discovery requirement, to protect the integrity of our site; or cooperate with a law enforcement, government or public safety investigation or request. 

We could share information if you ask or consent to us doing so. If information concerns multiple persons (like information on a couple identified as Mr. and Mrs. or on one or more parents and their child) we could share information on all of them, if any one of them asks or consents and represents that they speak for the group. 

If we outsource web management, or if there were ever a corporate sale or other transaction, information could be shared with an outsource service provider, buyer or the like. 

We may use non-personal statistical or aggregate information to evaluate and decide how to customize content you see, improve our services, conduct research, and provide anonymous aggregated reporting for analytical or statistical purposes. 

This policy does not apply to the websites of other companies even if we provide links to them on this Site. Please refer to that company’s Privacy Policy for more information. 

4\. Accuracy/Correction/Updating of Information   
You can control the accuracy of information you provide us. We encourage you to review information for accuracy before sending it to us. 

You can request that we update or correct previously provided information. In addition, you can request that we delete information or stop using information you provided. Please send your request in writing via the email or mailing address posted on the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20141121013909id_/http%3A//www.mathnasium.com/contact.html) page. 

5\. Children’s Privacy   
Mathnasium does not knowingly collect or maintain information provided by children under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 should ask a parent or guardian to provide their personal information online. 

6\. Choice/Opt-Out   
You can ask us to remove your information from our database and not receive future communications. To do this, please send your request via the email or mailing address posted on the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20141121013909id_/http%3A//www.mathnasium.com/contact.html) portion of this Site. It may take up to two weeks for the changes to be made. 

7\. Security   
We care about your privacy and the security of your personal information. This Site has security measures in place to reduce the risk of loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. As an additional measure, this policy does not state details of the security measures we use. 

No security measure provides certainty against all risks. Inadvertent disclosure is possible. Technology changes, computer hackers, and human error are examples of why it is impossible for anyone to absolutely assure that your information will never be accessed or disclosed. 

Accordingly, we and our directors, officers, employees, affiliates and other representatives shall not be liable for loss, injury or damage arising from or relating to disclosure of your information. 

8\. Your Privacy Rights in California    
California residents have the right to request from businesses with whom they have established a business relationship (1) a list of categories of personal information, such as name, address, e-mail address, and the type of services provided to the customer, that a business disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) in the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes and (2) names and addresses of all such third parties. To request the above information, please contact us in writing via the email or mailing address posted on the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20141121013909id_/http%3A//www.mathnasium.com/contact.html) portion of this Site. Please state "Request Under Calif. Civil Code Sec. 1798.3" prominently on your correspondence. We will respond to your request within 30 days of receipt. 

9\. Changes to Our Policy
