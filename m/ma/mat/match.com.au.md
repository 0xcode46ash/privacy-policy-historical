### Protecting all our Global Network members privacy

Although our ability to provide service requires that we collect personal information about our customers, we take measures to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of that information.

Online privacy concerns focus on the protection of "customer identifiable" information that an individual or other customer reasonably expects to be kept private. As the term suggests, "customer identifiable" information is information which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, a customer's name, address, or telephone number, e-mail address, and information about online activities that are directly linked to them.

We respect your privacy. We are not involved in the selling, trading or alternative unauthorised use of personal information. We promise that we will not pass on any of your personal details to any other another organisations. By providing us with your information and visiting this web site, you accept and consent to the practices described in this privacy policy.

### What information do we collect and how do we use it?

Match.com does collect information about you at different times. Instances include:

  1. ### Mandatory personal information needed for us to provide a service to you

To first join Match.com - Australia, information such as your name, contact details, age and gender are requested. We will not disclose this personal information unless we have received your express consent to do so.

We also may disclose this information to our subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated legal entities and businesses with whom we are under common corporate control. However, all of these parent, subsidiary and affiliated legal entities and businesses that receive your personal information from us will comply with the terms of this privacy policy with respect to their use and disclosure of such personal information. We may also disclose this information if we believe it is required by law - that is, to answer a subpoena, warrant or in response to other legal processes. All of your information may be transferred to and maintained on computer networks which may be located outside of the state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in which you reside, and the countries in which these computer networks are located may not have privacy laws as protective as the laws in your country.

  2. ### Non-personally identifiable (specific or aggregated) information, to improve our services

Apart from this mandatory information we need to provide our service to you, there may be data (that does not personally identify you) collected to monitor and improve Match.com - Australia service and performance. For example, when you visit a web page the URL requested is automatically recorded, as is the time and date requested, and the browser software being used.

Specific or aggregate information may be collected to help maintain accurate accounts, assist in marketing our products and services and to help make our web site useful to you. For example, our server recognises your domain name and the pages that you visit. This data is gathered in an aggregate manner for quality control and improvement of our sites.

From time to time, Match.com - Australia may provide aggregated statistical information about sales, browsing patterns and navigation techniques to reputable third parties. This is not personally identifiable information, and assists Match.com - Australia to improve products and services offered.

  3. ### Personal information voluntarily provided by you - for Match.com - Australia surveys, newsletters, and in conjunction with third party offers

We collect information that you volunteer to us on surveys, contests and on registration pages and use the information collected only to improve your Match.com - Australia online experience. These surveys are strictly confidential. We do not reveal, disclose, sell, distribute, rent, license, share or pass on to any third parties your personal information without your consent. From time to time Match.com - Australia may form relationships with other organisations to bring you special offers, competitions and subscriptions. For any third party offer or subscription, we require as a matter of policy that the third party clearly states their intentions with any information gathered, and attaches their privacy policy as a hyperlink to the offer or subscription.

The terms and conditions of the offer should also be clearly stated. Please read this information carefully, and understand that it is your own choice should you choose to disclose your personally identifiable information to the third party. The information that you offer to the third party is voluntary.

Match.com - Australia enters into third party business relationships with care, and will not share, disclose or sell any personally identifiable information collected at our site with third party companies or organisations without these conditions being met.

  4. ### Contacting you by e-mail

We may use your e-mail address for any purpose for which you provided it. We may also use it to respond to feedback given about our Site or Services, to provide you with any information you request, to confirm receipt of e-mails you have sent to us or if we need to contact you for any reason.

  5. ### Create a profile

We only record and publish (post) information that you provide directly to us as part of the Match.com - Australia service.

### Unsolicited commercial e-mail (UCE) or "spam"

Spam is the Internet term for marketing or commercial e-mail you receive for which you did not ask. Match.com - Australia does not and has never supported or condoned this practice.

Marketing mail from Match.com - Australia will generally be "opt-in" / "opt-out". This means that you should not receive any commercial or marketing e-mail from us unless you have requested it, that is, you have opted in.

You can send us a message telling us you would prefer not to receive the mail again and we will respect your wishes.

We may also send you e-mail providing general information about Services we provide or about goods or services that are available to you from other persons. Each time we do that, we will give you the opportunity to opt-out or unsubscribe should you choose not to receive further e-mails of that type.
