How the Collected Information is Used:

For example, we use anonymous information to make the website more navigable or to remember what is contained in your shopping cart or history. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us to better understand our site visitors and to help us tailor the website function accordingly.

For example, we may require you to submit personal information to fulfill your order, complete registration on the website, or send you information about our products.

To enhance your experience as a Site member, we send out message notifications, newsletters and site announcements, and from time to time third party offers from companies that we feel may have something that will benefit you. Our site provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving different types of communications (except system communications, or communications required for account maintenance), and each email that we send out has a method for opting-out located at the bottom of the message.
