# Matchpoint

At Matchpoint, we respect your privacy and take our responsibility to protect your personal information very seriously. In fact, our whole company depends on it.

  1. **DATA COLLECTION**
Here's the data that we collect and how we use it:
    1. Your email address 
      * We collect your email address so that we can forward messages to you from providers that are competing for your business. We do this after you reply to a confirmation email that we send to you in response to your request. If you don't confirm, we won't contact you again. We never give out your actual email address to any providers. You get to control when, if ever, that happens.
    2. Zip code 
      * We collect your zip code so that we can match you with local providers in your area.
    3. Other data 
      * While your email address and zip code are the only pieces of information required to use the Matchpoint service, we will often present you with other optional form fields such as age, income range, specific needs, etc. in order for you to narrow your search for providers. When you choose to provide this information to us, we will use it to match you with specific providers who are looking for interested consumers with that profile. In such cases, we will send the optional data to the provider, along with your Matchpoint proxy email address and your zip code, so that they can deliver customized messages to you regarding your inquiry and in order for them to evaluate the performance of their campaigns with Matchpoint.
    4. Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII). 
      * Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files to collect Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, and date/time stamp. We use the information to analyze site usage, administer the site, understand usage and navigation trends in aggregate, and determine the relevance of content.
      * When a consumer responds to or views a Matchpoint form or visits the Matchpoint site, we place a cookie that assigns an anonymous, unique identifier to the end user's Internet browser. Cookies are small data files commonly used on the Internet to help optimize and personalize the Internet end user experience and identify repeat visitors to Web sites. These cookies are not used to collect any personally identifiable information such as name, address, social security number, etc.
      * These cookies help us to personalize your experience and to pay partners that refer users to Matchpoint. We may retain ad delivery and reporting data that is necessary for accounting and audit purposes.
  2. **TERMS OF USE**

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR WEBSITE ARE GOVERNED BY OUR [TERMS OF USE](https://web.archive.org/web/20081216070359id_/http%3A//www.matchpoint.com/tc).

  3. **CHANGES**

Matchpoint may find it necessary or be legally obligated to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page and update the effective date so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Except as otherwise required by law, modifications to this Privacy Policy will not affect the privacy of data collected by Matchpoint prior to the effective date of the policy change unless we provide you direct notice and the opportunity to opt-out.
