Matrix has adopted this Privacy Statement in order to inform you of its policies with respect to information collected from this website. Your use of this website constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Statement and your consent to the practices it describes. 

Automatic Collection of Anonymous Information  
When you visit the Matrix website, like when you visit most other websites, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically logged, which may include information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the internet (such as “aol.com” or “earthlink.net”), the date and time you access the site, the pages you access while at the Matrix website, and the internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to the Matrix site. This information is not personally identifiable. Personally Identifiable Information is any information that concerns you individually and would permit someone to contact you, for example, your name, address, telephone/fax number, social security number, email address or any information you submitted to matrix.com that identifies you individually. 

matrix.com will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it. Therefore, if you do not want matrix.com to obtain any personally identifiable information about you, do not submit it. 

You can visit and browse the Matrix website without revealing personally identifiable information about yourself. You may also choose to disclose personally identifiable information about yourself, which may be maintained as described below. matrix.com may collect personally identifiable information about you from its website by methods such as the following:
