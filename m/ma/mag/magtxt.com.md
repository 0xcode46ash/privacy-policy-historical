     Indeed dogs can be your 24/7 companion. They are always available for you and just for you only. There are three things that dogs love. First of course you as its human best friend, be happy because you are on the top of the list. Second, dogs love to play. It is up to you to define how our dogs play, some would enjoy and settle for short walks in the streets or somewhere where he can enjoy his eyes of things he find interesting. Lastly, dogs love to eat!  However although you wanted to share everything to your lovely pet, there are some restrictions that you need to follow in giving your dog some treats.      There are only few people who are not fond of chocolates. In fact almost all would get excited about it. Chocolates come in cakes, drinks, ice-creams and many more. But do you know that your most favorite flavor is actually bad for your dog? You could be torn on which is which, but as long as you will not share your chocolate with your dog, everything will be fine.          So what’s inside this chocolate that it can be bad for dogs yet humans love it so much? Chocolate is extracted from the cocoa fruit. Chocolates contain a certain compound called “Theobromine” which is actually a type of alkaloid. It is somewhat the same with caffeine, both are classified as stimulants. The problem occurs due to the inability of dogs to break this compound. Dogs don’t have the enzyme to metabolize Theobromine thus it stays within the dogs system and becomes toxic. Since it is considered as a stimulant, it affects the central nervous system (CNS) of your dog, causing increase in the level of blood pressure. This will then result to rapid heart rate, seizure, and vomiting, frequent urination, muscle twitching, hyperactive behavior, dehydration and many more. With all of these complications it can certainly put the dog into a fatal condition. In more of common terms, people would say that dogs are allergic to chocolates, dogs are not allergic to chocolates but chocolates are bad for them because there is no way for them to metabolize it.      Moreover the amount of chocolates that can cause those complications mentioned above will actually depend on the size of your dog. Larger dogs may have a much higher tolerance with the toxicity of the compound. Meanwhile the small ones may are more likely to react even in small amount of chocolates. Before thinking of giving your dog some of your favorite sweets, think a thousand times before doing so. You are risking your dog’s life because of your inappropriate thoughts.

    In 1937, General MacArthur married with Miss Faircloth. And on December of the same year he retired from military service but went on to live in Manila. But Roosevelt regionalized the Philippine Army on July 26, 1941. He then reassigned MacArthur to stand as major general of the American Army naming Douglas as commander of the USAFFE. Within a day, Macarthur’s promotion to lieutenant was proclaimed. Afterwards he was promoted on December 20, 1941 as a general. Other known officers were also promoted during that time. Sutherland became major general and Hugh Casey became brigadier general. By July 31, 1941 over twenty two thousand troops had been assigned by the Philippine Department.      General Douglas MacArthur’s famous ‘’I shall return’’ speech were a result of his escape from one of the most famous battles in the history of the Philippines known as the Fall of Bataan. In December 8, 1941 MacArthur was informed by Sutherland of the ambush on Pearl Harbor. Gen. George Marshall gave MacArthur orders to continue the original Rainbow Five war plan. But Douglas refused to follow the order. There were also requests of permission to hit bases owned by the Japanese from an Air Force commander but all were denied. They were confused on what to do next because of the attack that happened on Pearl Harbor. At noontime, Japanese Air crafts surprised and bombarded Clark Field and bases at the Iba Field and in a few days the US Air Force were all destroyed.     When the defense plans failed to stop the Japanese from taking Manila, the Filipino and U.S. Forces were called to retreat and bring all the war supplies to Bataan. MacArthur tried to lessen the Japanese speed in advancing but changed his mind when he saw the quick advancement of the Japanese and their superiority in battle against the Filipino troops. He called everyone to retreat to the Bataan peninsula to wait for reinforcements there. On December 24, 1941 the declaration of Manila as an open city was announced.     On the next day, MacArthur had to transfer his headquarters to the fortresses of Corregidor due to the destruction of nearly all of the USAFFE bases. Many of the headquarters started to go for Bataan to leave MacArthur. Although the Filipino and Americans knew they were hopeless they still fought the Japanese. Some of them blamed MacArthur because of the failure but others believed he would find a way to get them out of the mess.      The Japanese Army gradually neutralized most of the defenders of the Philippines on February in 1942. On the same year President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to move to Australia. He left with his family and major general Sutherland in PT boats away from Corregidor on March 12, 1942. They were received by B-17s and flew off to Australia. On March 20, 1942 he made his famous speech to return to the Philippine Islands. He was told by Washington to change the “I” on his statement to “we” but MacArthur refused it. In his speech he said, “ I came through and I shall return” stressing his resolve to redeem the Philippines from its enemies.  Meanwhile, after a series of battles, Bataan fell to the hands of the Japanese Army.     October 1944 gave MacArthur the chance he’d been waiting for. On the 20th of that month, and after efforts to be summoned by Roosevelt to Philippines, General Douglas was finally back in the Philippines. He landed on Leyte with the Sixth Army of Krueger’s troops where they waded on foot in the waters of the Leyte beach. He also made another famous speech where he reassured the Filipinos of his promise to eradicate their enemies once and for all. And after two months, the Japanese Army lost Leyte to the US Army.

Iphone7 did drop off the historic headphone jack in exchange of the iphone earpods. Users should expect for a wireless lightning earpods that works through bluetooth connection. Choosing to go wireless has drawn so much controversy to the Apple Company, yet their Marketing Chief Phil Schiller, stood firm and proud of the dynamic change of the Iphone7. According to Schiller, they decided to get rid of the traditional analog type of headphones not due to superficial reasons or perhaps to elicit an elegant style, but because the traditional design is consuming too much space for the device’s new processor. They have to let go of it and had the courage to go wireless.      However, although it’s for the device’s own good in order to optimize its capacity, these lightning earpods are actually sold separately. Yes, you heard it right. Unlike the usual package when you buy a new device, Iphone7’s lightning earpods are not for free. So what’s the deal if you opt only for the device and you find it too costly to go for the lightning earpods? Well, you can still use your old headphones but it will take a quite turn before you can use it. You need to use an adapter that you have to connect through the charging port and connect your headphones on that adapter.      Which would look like this:      It’s indeed quite a job and a bit hassle, especially when you choose to walk around with your headphones on. With this, one will surely decide to go for the lightning earpods, if and only if you have the budget for it.

Make-ups and other forms of cosmetics were made to enhance a person’s good assets and hide or conceal imperfections. It has been part of the daily lives of the people, mostly by women. To look beautiful and presentable has always been part of any woman’s goals of the day. It is an unspoken rule that if you can’t be beautiful then be at least presentable. Whether you like it or not, first impression doesn’t only last, it really matters.                 However, it is a sad reality that although these make-ups and cosmetics can make a person look more beautiful it contains chemicals that can actually take away your natural glow or natural beauty. Lipsticks contain certain compounds that can actually darken your lips and change its natural color. Other make-ups can also cause skin allergies or irritation and even cause skin impurities.                 Good thing, organic make ups are now available in the market. You can now enjoy using these kinds of cosmetics without worrying of any side effects. Organic make-ups are proven to be safe and free from harmful chemicals. If you are thinking of shifting to organic make-ups there are things that you need to know so that you will not be left dissatisfied with your decision.                 Since organic makeups uses pure and organic materials, it is way more expensive compared to the ordinary make up products. But if this ensures the health of your skin, it is still a very good investment despite of its price. Also, there are only few choices for organic make-ups, such as lipstick shades. It is because unlike the ordinary type of cosmetics, organic make ups depend only on natural occurring colors which can be extracted from organic compounds. Commercial or ordinary cosmetics use artificial colors in order to achieve almost every shade that they want to produce. Also, organic make ups have shorter expiration periods. Again, because of being organic and free from chemicals, its shelf life is also affected.                 Patronizing organic make up can actually be part of a healthy living lifestyle. The more you eliminate artificial chemicals within your daily routine the healthier you are. Organic products can never be beaten even by the most popular brand of make-up. Sometimes you don’t actually need to have full coverage of make-up foundation; sometimes you just have to make ways to make your skin healthier. Once you nourish it properly, you will no longer worry about acne breakouts, and other skin blemishes. Practice proper hygiene and start using products that are actually doing great for your skin inside and out.

In the interest of Samsung to preserve its customers, they tried to recall all galaxy note 7 that were sold to the public. Some of the remedy that they offered was to issue refund particularly for those customers who already lost interest in waiting for the galaxy note 7 to be back.

In the midst of the current administration’s new governance, sparked controversial sentiments, lots of opinions were thrown between two opposing parties, particularly the Duterte Administration and those who are not convinced of his way of control specifically on his war against drugs. One of the most talked about remarks was made by an actress, Ms. Agot Isidro. Ms. Isidro, in her Facebook status update, slammed the President for the statements he gave during one of his speeches. Aside from criticizing Duterte with his way of governance and his behavior to other foreign personalities, she ended her post by calling Duterte not a Bipolar but a Psychopath. Ms. Isidro’s statement steamed over the social media. Several people expressed disagreement with her post not because of her remarks toward the President, but when she used the term Bipolar and Psychopath. The comments in general condemned Ms. Agot’s use of these terms without being aware of the weight of her statements. She is not an expert on such field yet she vocally used it as if it is just a common term to be used. A psychopath is not merely a term used to describe a person with a wicked personality. It is a mental health illness. It is thoroughly defined with the help of DSM-5 or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, 5th ed. Psychopathy, is a type of personality disorder. Personality disorder is a mental health illness that has something to do with a person’s maladaptive behavior towards his or her environment, this includes the people around him or her, and that prevents the person to function normally. In Psychopathy, the problem focuses on the person’s insistent antisocial behavior. Antisocial behavior is the lack of capacity or the need to isolate oneself from other people. Psychopaths are known to behave maladaptive with other people. They don’t socialize and building a relationship for them is the hardest thing to do. Their withdrawal towards their environment is characterized by egoistic desires thus they don’t feel remorse if they have to abandon a certain person or situation. A psychopath is a type of mental illness but it isn’t different from being a diabetic or asthmatic, the only difference is that it has something to do with the mental and not on the physical state of the patient. Thus if you criticize and use it to describe your disappointment to a particular person, you are as if demeaning a person’s worth because of having a diabetes or asthma. It is a very serious matter that using it to disgrace a person must not be tolerated. It is important to educate the people that mental health illnesses must not be taken lightly. People should stop from using such terms without being properly aware of how complex and sensitive it is. People with mental health issues never wished to have it within their system. Nobody wants to feel bad about one’s self, and yet it is often the great struggle of those who are suffering from such illnesses.

            The controversial case of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 has made terrible rounds in the internet all over the world. There were series of articles published about how this device made a huge threat on every person’s life. Although it may sound too much, but it is indeed true. The best example is the protocol being followed by airline companies. All passengers and crews are prohibited to charge their galaxy note 7 while on board. It is the first time that such protocol has been issued to ensure the safety of all passengers. This is how serious the case is.           Three months from its first launching, what happened to this very controversial device? A wide recall has been issued after it has been proved that these devices actually overheat and has a great tendency to explode. Recall on galaxy note 7 devices first took place in US. According to Samsung they are trying their best to provide and replace recalled devices as soon as possible. However after the recall there are still complains that the replaced units are still prone to overheat. There were incidents noted on this matter. One of the latest incidents is when a Southwest Airline was forced to go back barely ten minutes after its flight when a passenger’s device, a galaxy note 7 started to produce smoke and overheated. Passengers were then evacuated from the airline as part of their safety protocol.           Samsung however, did not give any official statement regarding this issue. According to them they must first see and examine those replaced devices and check it for themselves if it really exploded because of its batteries or the device mainly. They are also willing to offer their customers to replace their Galaxy Note 7 with other devices such as Samsung Galaxy S7.            Although Samsung has already issued recall on their galaxy note 7, there is no definite statement yet that these devices are safe for using. It is such dismay for every note lover because it has been one of the most anticipated devices of the note series. With this alone, it is as if galaxy note 7 is suffering from a very slow and painful death. Who would want to purchase this device if this can actually put your life in danger? No one would ever dare to risk for this device unless Samsung could finally clear this issue. It is quite surprising that when Samsung managed to become one of the best makers of smart phones, it is now that they experienced great distress.                                   It is very unfortunate especially for those who experienced physical injuries from using this device. It is such a huge thing how come Samsung never had the chance to check on their products before releasing it to the public. How come up to this moment, even replaced devices are still prone to overheating? Unfortunately, these are questions that only Samsung could answer.
