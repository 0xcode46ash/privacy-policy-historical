    The Black Nazarene has many names. In Spanish it is called the Nuestro Padre Jesus Nazareno. In Filipino it is known as Mahal na Itim na Nazareno or Itim na Nazareno. But its formal name in English is “Our Father Jesus Nazarene”. The black Nazarene is wooden sculpture of Jesus Christ. It is a life-sized figure carrying the cross. Filipino Catholics believe the wooden figure to be possessed with miraculous nature. In the beginning the Black Nazarene had a fair complexion. But because of a fire that burned the ship it was carried on, it turned black. Luckily, the sculpture survived. The sculptor of the image has always been unanimous. According to history, it was brought to Manila from Acapulco, Mexico via a galleon ship.      Originally, the Black Nazarene had an identical twin sculpture which was brought to Manila. This is found in the Intramuros district church records. It is said that the first one kept in Bagumbayan’s San Nicolas de Tolentino church before it was transferred to Intramuros. Unfortunately the Battle of Manila in 1945 destroyed this first image of the Black Nazarene when a bomb hit it. By then, the other sculpture was placed in the Quiapo church where some people thought it to be the original one. In the year 1650 Pope Innocent X gave his approval of the Black Nazarene for veneration as Sacramental. He also gave the permission to the Confraternity of the Most Holy Jesus Nazarene.      Filipino Catholics and those who relate to the Passion of Christ venerate the Black Nazarene. Most of them would relate their hardships to the struggles that were experienced by Jesus himself such the one presented in the image of the statue. Devotees clap their hands after the offering of mass at the shrine as a sign of homage.      Three processions take place each year when the Black Nazarene is taken out for veneration. The procession takes place on New Year’s Day, January 9 and Good Friday. January 9 processions commemorate the transferring of the Nazarene to Quiapo church. On that day, the image is carried out to the street in a carriage called the “andas” which means “to go forward” in Spanish. The devotees would walk barefoot and wear maroon colored clothes as an act of reminiscing Jesus when he went to Mount Calvary. The carriage is tied with a rope which men would pull. In the past only men were allowed to pull the ropes but recently female devotees joined in the act. The Catholics would touch the image hoping for a miracle to happen. Some people allegedly have even been reported to have had their diseases cured after contact with the Nazarene. Because of this, desperate devotees who can’t get near the statue would throw their towels at the guards requesting them to rub it on the image hoping that its miracles would rub in the cloth. The procession of the Black Nazarene on feast day is known to be a fatal one because of the heat, fatigue and the massive numbers of devotees reaching to millions.     Fortunately, when the number of devotees rose to 8 million, the route on the 9th January was altered to a much wider street located at the Quirino Grandstand in Rizal Park. This is also the first place where the Nazarene was enshrined. At the end of the day, the statue is returned to the church. In contrast to this veneration, the other two commemoration of the Black Nazarene on New Year’s Day and Good Friday is a solemn one.

    If you are reading this then you are most likely a middle child who is looking for confirmation that you really feel special because of your controversial birth order. Although less attention is given to middle children during child rearing, middle children became an interesting target for research because of their complicated situation. Children who were born on such order have great qualities especially when it comes to coping and socialization. But what are the most common traits that makes up a middle child? Here is the list: 1.    A part of you will always feel that nobody cares about you – it is the most fundamental feeling that the middle children share. It starts when you just don’t know who or what you should be. The parents are busy making your older sibling responsible and at the same time they are busy looking after and enjoying your younger sibling.  2.    You were used to being alone but you are not even sad about it – although not all middle children are introverts, there is a strong force that pushes a middle child to enjoy a moment of himself or herself to meditate or to think of plans especially when a decision has to be made.  3.     You talk to yourself vocally – although it wasn’t intentional, most middle kids were not given the chance to voice out their opinion because it is the job of the older sibling and such decisions are actually made for the benefit of the youngest child. In a way, middle children have been used to voice out their thoughts to their selves alone. They do it because they actually value listening to opinion since they weren’t given that chance when they were young. 4.     You always think that you are not your parents’ favorite – parental biases will always take place no matter how many times parents say that they don’t have favoritism among their children. Meanwhile, the middles would voluntarily take the place of not being the favorite child or the less appreciated one because they have been used to sacrifice  ever since they became a middle child. 5.    It always comes to you to consider other people’s feelings before you make any decision – although this may sound too kind this is actually true for almost all middle kids. Since they were used to get caught in the middle they learned how it feels to be on top of someone and at the same time find themselves in the bottom.  6.     You feel a bit distant and secretive to your own family – this is a thing that only middle children could understand. It may sound rebellious but it is not. Since they were used being left behind or that their opinions don’t really matter at all, they become cautious in opening up or trusting a family member.

     A few days after the recent launching of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7, several complaints were already raised against one of the most anticipated smartphones of today’s era. Due to the severity of the issue Samsung decided to replace all sold units of galaxy note 7. It was when the first few customers of the product experienced issues with its battery. It happens to overheat during the charging of device. It actually explodes making it a very hazard one when it comes to safety and security issues. People are now questioning how was it able to pass the quality control standards? To note, this is the first time that Samsung experienced this kind of incident. Is it a sign that Samsung is now lowering its quality to take lead on its number one adversary? Definitely this occurrence stained Samsung’s most valued reputation.     It is such dismay that Samsung wasn’t able to detect this problem before launching it to the public. Aside from the recall for sold items, marketing of Galaxy Note 7 has been stopped for the meantime. People are now confused as to how their devices can be replaced and how long would it take them to wait. As of the moment Galaxy Note 7 has already sold quite a number of units.      According to some tech analysts, Samsung was trying to get ahead of the release of Iphone 7; unfortunately it turned out to be a disaster instead of advancing from its opponent. However several people would still want to wait for the release of the new device provided that all issues shall be resolved before making it available to the public.     With this scenario, one could essentially realize the downside of being too excited and hunching for the release of the latest device. Although it pays off being updated, not to mention showing off its newest features, but how are these people going to deal with their devices? Returning their devices doesn’t mean they can also have their money back. Rather they need to wait for a certain period of time before they can eventually have their paid items back unto their hands.      Several memes surfaced in the internet and although it may seem ridiculous, you will surely get it on point. Will Galaxy Note lovers remain loyal to their adored devices? We will find out in the next few days.

    A human being is a social animal. Regardless of the situation a person would always want to have someone to be with. Nobody wants to be left behind. However not all people are lucky enough to find their companions or best friends in life because of varied reasons. But who says only a human being can complete another human being? Dogs are great companions too and they have earned the title of being man’s best friend since time immemorial.      If you are thinking of having a dog and you don’t have any breed in particular to choose from it is best to have a rescue dog. A rescue dog is basically a dog which came from sanctuaries or those that were saved from being abandoned. These types of dogs have no definite breed at all. You might never able to trace its pedigree and its bloodline; however they are as special as those being commercialized in pet stores.      The best thing about choosing rescue dogs is that you are giving them the second chance to live a life that they have been wishing for. There are only few people who would choose to adopt dogs rather than shop. This only means that there are also only few dogs that would be given the chance to have their forever home. It is also heartbreaking to know that not all shelters practice the no-kill policy. When rescued dogs remain in the shelter for quite long already, they are euthanize or being put to sleep without even experiencing the joy of being part in a family.      Adopting a dog from shelters could be the best decision you can ever think of. If you are longing for a companion or a best friend, they are just perfect. These dogs have painful experiences in their past but they are still hopeful to find that special person who will prove to them that dogs are indeed man’s best friend.      By getting a rescue dog, you are helping organizations to continue their goals in putting an end to animal cruelty and animal neglect. If you are thinking that dogs that came from shelters are problematic dogs then you are wrong. Although most of them are strays, these dogs were given the medication they needed before they are released and are set for adoption. It is also a protocol for any shelter to spay and neuter every rescue dog under their facility. By doing this, dogs are protected from unplanned pregnancies and over population which then may result to neglect.     There are several animal welfare groups in the Philippines such as the Philippine Animal Rescue Team (http://www.philanimalrescue.org/) where you can finally meet your new best friend. Pay them a visit now; they are all waiting for you.

    In a certain Facebook post by Mark Dianne Duarte, three women are now asking for help from anyone with a good heart to help them with their current situation. The victims are residents of Cabdbaran Agusan del Sur.      With the intent to enhance and beautify themselves, they decided to undergo treatment from a person whom they barely know. The procedure went by injecting some unknown chemicals unto their faces. However instead of having better and beautiful faces, it went really worse and appeared distorted. The three of them have the same reaction with the chemical.     With the help of their friends and families, they are now trying to reach a certain amount in order to help the victims. Aside from the horrible outcome of what happened, the victims are now starting to become ill and are all afraid of what could happen to them if not given the proper care.     Unfortunately, the suspect is now nowhere to be found. The victims were not even aware of the suspect’s whereabouts.     According to the one who posted, a certain media will then cover the story of these women, to inform and especially warn those who would dare to undergo such procedure.

    When you don’t have sweet tooth it is hard to find snacks that can match your low tolerance for sugar. Almost all snacks were made out of sugar, chocolates and other forms of sweeteners. It is the main reason why Skittles stands out from the rest of the group. It is a sweet yet sour candy that comes in a bright rainbow colors. But all of a sudden Skittles became really dull and lost all that rainbow colors.     In an official stamen made by Skittles, they decided to have a different packaging for intended for the entire month of June. As practiced June is the month dedicated for the LGBT community. The LGBT community has the rainbow to represent them because they acknowledged that they are composed of different genders thus constitutes not just a single color but of different colors.      Since the Skittles and the LGBT community share the same kind of color representation, Skittles gladly gave way to the LGBT community. According to them, although the share the same symbol, one has to stand out and celebrate their existence and they give it whole heartedly to the LGBT group.      This is such a remarkable and thoughtful move for Skittles. Although they were branded and known because of their color, they were not afraid to give way to celebrate a significant event for some people. Consumers in return have shown appreciation to what the company did. Their customers admired their sensitive and immediate decision to honor the LGBT community.     Changing brand packaging is a bit risky when it comes to sales and market. Well known and established companies see to it that when they have to change or modify their packaging it needs to be somehow close to the previous design. It is because people shop out of familiarity. When you change your packaging into a totally different concept, chances are your consumers will not be able to recognize your products anymore.      However it is different with the case of Skittles. They dared to risk their sales and their brand in order to commemorate an event. With this making rounds in the internet, Skittles is rest assured that their customers would still remain loyal to them.
