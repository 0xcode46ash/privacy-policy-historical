    Society today has taught us that emotions, especially of the negative nature, should be suppressed or held back, thinking that it will lead us to less conflicts or avoid them all together. Yet studies have shown this shouldn’t be the case. In fact, the more you hold them back, the more unnatural and tense you’ll be. The human psyche is made up of so much more than the pursuit of joy, happiness and glee. Negative emotions – like anger, envy, sorrow, disgust, fear, etc. are all natural; they help us define the world we live in, act as buffers warning and safeguarding us from potential or present threats, and if just dealt with wisely, would help us cope and live a more balanced and fulfilling life. Constantly suppressing bad and troublesome thoughts is like running away and not really dealing with your present issues head-on. The bottled up emotions will then turn sour and ultimately toxic. Anger could turn into rage and hatred. Sorrow could turn into depression. Fears could turn into panic, or worse yet, phobias. You get the idea.     Recent studies have shown that suppressing toxic emotions could lead to cancer – particularly anger, hate, resentment and grief. Scientists have discovered that the rise of stress hormones like cortisol directly suppresses our immune systems to function properly. It’s like our bodies’ security system goes out of whack, and with our literal “bodyguards” not up to order, the normal cells will mutate and turn into cancer cells.     The studies have noted that most of the cancer patients had low anger scores, which means they either suppressed (consciously held back), repressed (unconsciously put in the back of their minds) and restrained themselves from expressing their anger. Follow-up studies, on the other hand, showed that survival rates of people who openly expressed their anger have doubled. If you’d like to read more about this in detail, I highly recommend you go to Alternative-Cancer-Care’s website.     Cancer, by definition, is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in our bodies that will then spread and invade healthy nearby tissues. In essence, they’re cells that don’t belong to your body but will try to destroy you. I guess what nature is trying to teach us is that: Toxic emotions are never meant to be part of us. The human soul, as enigmatic as it could be, has never been designed to harbor emotional toxins, and it is our responsibility to be free from them. Mental hygiene is just as important and vital as physical hygiene.  

[ ](https://web.archive.org/article/129/7-reasons-why-laughing-each-day-not-just-apple-keeps-doctor-away)

    The old proverb, “Laughter is the best medicine”, originally came from the Bible. Proverbs 17:22 says that, “A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.” In literature, we can find numerous writers magnifying the powers of laughter. To name a few, E. E. Cummings wrote that, “The most wasted of all days is one without laughter.” An unknown joker wrote, “Take two jokes and call me in the morning.” A worthwhile and free prescription, if you ask me.     It’s no wonder; even modern day science has come to attest this phenomenon. Studies have been steadily on the rise in backing it up. Here are a few reasons why you should never let a day pass by without having a few minutes of a good old chuckle: 1.    Laughter is good for the heart. Maybe not for a specific ailment, but laughter does have healing properties, according to studies. A good belly laugh can cause your brain to release endorphins, our bodies’ “happy pill”. Endorphins are pleasure-inducing neurotransmitters that help increase blood flow and reduce cholesterol build-up. The Biblical proverb, “A merry heart doeth good like a medicine”, really does hold true, even in a medical sense. 2.    Laughter has numerous physical benefits. Research has found these powerful benefits in laughter therapy: •    Improves oxygen intake •    Steadies blood pressure •    Unwinds muscles •    Improves sleep •    Eases digestion or calms stomach aches •    Improve overall mood and attitude 3.    Laughter is a powerful cure to stress. A good laugh can do wonders in bringing balance to your mind and body. It helps lighten burdens, reduce pain, ease up pressure and as a whole, supports both physical and emotional health. 4.    Laughter is contagious and helps you build connections. You noticed how, when a person takes a picture of you, you’re not the only one smiling at the camera? Even the photographer is smiling with you. This isn’t just a way to bond or encourage you to smile, but is actually caused by “mirror neurons”. When you’re down on your lumps, sticking around with jokers would be a great way to lift that frown off your face. Not only that, when there’s relational tension and conflicts, laughter can help you reconnect, build rapport, and even release anger and aid you in forgiving more easily. 5.    Laughter makes you tough. People who persevere and resilient have been known to be happy people. People who know how to laugh at themselves tend to accept their mistakes more easily, thereby enabling them to acknowledge these mistakes, recognize what went wrong, and overall, learn to overcome them. And with the ability to endure, success will be within reach. 6.    Laughter can help burn calories. OK, so maybe not a whole afternoon of gym’s workout worth of calories. But one study noted that laughing for a good 10-15 minutes is the equivalent of 40 calories. Also, your body will be more in sync and filled with happy neurons that could help make going to the gym an overall better experience. It’s a win-win situation, really. 7.    Laughter is good therapy for patients. Laughter therapy is now being explored by researchers on its effect especially in cancer patients. With its ability to decrease stress-related hormones, it can distract them from the patients from pain and boost their immune system. I know, cancer is no laughing matter, but as hard as it may seem to be, laughing may induce physical changes in the body. It may not be the next cure to cancer but would be a tremendous help in the overall healing process.

    Have you been mistaken for your age because of those heavy bags under your eyes? This happens most of the time because eye bags can really affect your face and your aura. If you have been watching make up tutorials, one of the most important areas in your face that needs a great concealer are your eye bags. People who have heavy and dark eye bags are usually judged to have stressful lives and are on the brink of their career and that they are slowly deteriorating.      It is hard to appear fresh and lively if you have those bags with you and no matter what you do they seemed to stay with you for the rest of time. You might be wondering what you have been doing wrong all this time to have those ugly things with you. Here are the lists of common mistakes that often result to huge, dark and ugly eye bags.  1.    Too much consumption of salt. Salt is a compound primarily composed of sodium. A food which is high in salt can trigger your kidneys to release signals to normalize the amount of sodium in your body. The only way to buffer and balance the amount of sodium is through water. Your body sends water on areas which has low water content such as the area under your eyes. Since you have thin skin on this area, bloating is highly noticeable. This often results to puffy eyes but more people prefer to call it eye bags. 2.    Swollen eye bags can be caused by allergies. When a person experience an allergic reaction one of the most common indicator is through unending sneezing. Since the areas where your eyes bags are located are near the sinuses it is also affected by the allergic reaction. 3.    Your sleeping position can be the culprit as well. People may think your sleeping position does not affect your eyes at all. However by sleeping in a relaxed position, which means by sleeping with your back against the bed you are  actually preventing the flow of fluid underneath your eyes 4.    Sleeping with your make up. When you have been through a rough day, all you want to do is to rest and sleep soundly. However it is important to remove those make up first before hitting your bed. Sleeping with your make up on can actually make your eyes dry. In order to reinforce the dryness your body sends signals and direct water to flush your eye bags .  5.    Too much consumption of alcohol. Alcohol can remove the water from your eyes because of its diuretic nature. When this happens, again your body will send signals in order for water to stay where it is needed. This is the reason why you’ll end up with very puffy eyes the next day. 6.    Lack of sleep. It is often the most common reason why a person can have dark circles under the eyes. However staying up late isn’t the main reason. Staying awake for more hours than usual can actually drain the liquid under your eyes. Aside from dehydration, the dark circles indicate fatigue as well. This occurs when the body has worked for hours without having the chance to rest.

    The Mount Mayon is a volcano that has an exact symmetrical cone. It is called the "perfect cone". The location of the volcano is at the province of Albay in Luzon. The perfect cone has an elevation of 8,081 ft with a prominence of 8,028 ft. As an active volcano its last eruption was on the year 2010. Mayon can be found at the tip or within the boundary of Legazpi City. In the year 2000 it was developed into a national park. It is also nicknamed as Bulkang Magayon after the legend of "Daragang Mayon".     The perfect cone of the volcano was formed by layers of lava flows and eruptions that it has gone through in the past years. It is included in the Pacific Ring of Fire like other volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean. The volcano is situated in the east side of Luzon with a position close to the Philippine Trench or the boundary wherein the Sea Plate is placed right under the Mobile Belt. When these plates collide with the oceanic plate it is driven down towards the Earth’s mantle. Magma enters and finds a way through exit points such as the Mount Mayon through those gaps in the crust created by the collision of plates.     For over 400 years Mayon Volcano has erupted 48 times. It is the most active volcano in the Philippines. Its most vicious eruption ever recorded was on February 1, 1814 when the volcano spitted black ashes continuously until it buried Cagsawa town. It is the most fatal explosion as its casualties rose to 2,200 Albay residents. There are theories that this explosion triggered the eruption in Mount Tambora the following year which led to the “Year Without Summer” of 1816.     As for the longest eruption without any interruption the Mayon volcano spitted fire for seven days starting on June 23, 1897. It erupted eastward so that Bacacay Village was buried 49ft under the lava. This eruption took 100 lives in Libon and another 400 from the other surrounding villages.     Fortunately in the 1984 eruption an estimated number of more than 70,000 people were evacuated from danger zones before the volcano erupted. There were low casualties also in the 1993 eruption compared to past eruptions as only 77 were killed most of which were farmers.     It was the same with the 2006 eruption which has no record of any loss of life. It is reported though that the said eruption was now weaker than the past. But some scientists still believe that the rumblings and activities that Mount Mayon is going through constantly from 2006 to 2011 are all part of a possibly more destructive eruption somewhere in the future.     Legends were offered by the people in an attempt to provide answers to the mysterious origin of Mayon. According to them there used to be a princess who had a very possessive uncle named Magayon. Men were so afraid to court the girl because of her uncle. One day a warrior got so obsessed with the princess. He was so much in love that he convinced her to go with him to a faraway place. With Magayon in pursuit the princess and the warrior prayed for help from the gods. Suddenly there came a landslide which buried Magayon alive. Local folks believe that it is Magayon's anger which bursts out from the Mount's cone.

But before you feel giddily with that idea try to comprehend first why on earth it is so cheap? Could it be fake? Answer? A big fat YES!            Sellers of fake makeup particularly those online, have different strategies to sway their prospect customers such as like this on this picture.               Just to educate the general public, there is no such thing as secondhand makeup or makeup overruns. It is only in between a real or a fake one. Counterfeit makeups became really popular these days because makers of these products have observed that a lot of people particularly women showed great interest in buying such kinds of items. Who wouldn’t want to earn easy money right?            There are indeed some people who would neglect or disregard the fact that makeups sold in a very cheap price are actually fake. They are more concern of their curiosity to try it on and see how it can make them more beautiful. However it is often not the case because it has been found out that counterfeit makeups actually contain harmful ingredients that can cause serious injuries to the skin, eyes and even nose. Would you still want to trade your health in exchange of a cheap makeup? You should think about it. It is better to remain healthy rather than sorry. Here is a sample of a real and a counterfeit makeup.                 It is not actually difficult to spot a fake makeup if you can check it personally, however if you only saw it on Facebook or Instagram then it is really a tough one since you can get fooled with the pictures that they are using; nonetheless, the things that you need to watch out for are the following: Label or packaging – counterfeits would surely try to deceive you with its packaging but you can easily identify a fake from a real one. Real ones have clearer prints and clean packaging. Legit makeup companies see to it that their products are tightly sealed and marked correctly which is actually the opposite of mass production of counterfeit makeups. Color and texture – this can be often identified in pressed powders, blushers, eye shadows and the likes, you will notice that the materials comes in granules and not in a powder finish. Also, if you try to research for a specific shade, counterfeits are way dull and has a different shade from the real ones. Smell - for items that comes in powder or liquid, if you have doubts about the authenticity, try to smell the item, fake ones have similar scents and usually have stronger scent compared to the real ones. Price – this would be the most obvious indicator if a makeup is real or fake. If it is like 70% - 80% much cheaper from the regular price then you should absolutely forget about it. Having it on huge sale can be possible, but if it seems like all of their products have almost similar prices, then you probably encountered the fake ones       With a very cheap price you will surely get swayed with these offers but just remember that these things can actually put your life in danger such as this.   She had swollen eyes after using fake eyeliner, and mascara.

    In a certain Facebook post by Mark Dianne Duarte, three women are now asking for help from anyone with a good heart to help them with their current situation. The victims are residents of Cabdbaran Agusan del Sur.      With the intent to enhance and beautify themselves, they decided to undergo treatment from a person whom they barely know. The procedure went by injecting some unknown chemicals unto their faces. However instead of having better and beautiful faces, it went really worse and appeared distorted. The three of them have the same reaction with the chemical.     With the help of their friends and families, they are now trying to reach a certain amount in order to help the victims. Aside from the horrible outcome of what happened, the victims are now starting to become ill and are all afraid of what could happen to them if not given the proper care.     Unfortunately, the suspect is now nowhere to be found. The victims were not even aware of the suspect’s whereabouts.     According to the one who posted, a certain media will then cover the story of these women, to inform and especially warn those who would dare to undergo such procedure.

    When you don’t have sweet tooth it is hard to find snacks that can match your low tolerance for sugar. Almost all snacks were made out of sugar, chocolates and other forms of sweeteners. It is the main reason why Skittles stands out from the rest of the group. It is a sweet yet sour candy that comes in a bright rainbow colors. But all of a sudden Skittles became really dull and lost all that rainbow colors.     In an official stamen made by Skittles, they decided to have a different packaging for intended for the entire month of June. As practiced June is the month dedicated for the LGBT community. The LGBT community has the rainbow to represent them because they acknowledged that they are composed of different genders thus constitutes not just a single color but of different colors.      Since the Skittles and the LGBT community share the same kind of color representation, Skittles gladly gave way to the LGBT community. According to them, although the share the same symbol, one has to stand out and celebrate their existence and they give it whole heartedly to the LGBT group.      This is such a remarkable and thoughtful move for Skittles. Although they were branded and known because of their color, they were not afraid to give way to celebrate a significant event for some people. Consumers in return have shown appreciation to what the company did. Their customers admired their sensitive and immediate decision to honor the LGBT community.     Changing brand packaging is a bit risky when it comes to sales and market. Well known and established companies see to it that when they have to change or modify their packaging it needs to be somehow close to the previous design. It is because people shop out of familiarity. When you change your packaging into a totally different concept, chances are your consumers will not be able to recognize your products anymore.      However it is different with the case of Skittles. They dared to risk their sales and their brand in order to commemorate an event. With this making rounds in the internet, Skittles is rest assured that their customers would still remain loyal to them.
