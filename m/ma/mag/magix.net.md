# Privacy Statement by MAGIX

## Web Terms of Service and Privacy Statement

At MAGIX we take your privacy very seriously. As such, we want to provide you with detailed information on how we collect, gather, and identify information during your visit to our site. This information may be expanded or be updated as we change or develop our site. For this reason, we recommend that you review this policy from time-to-time to see if anything has changed. 

## WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW DO WE USE IT? 

MAGIX collects information on our users in three ways: by voluntary submission through opt-in email and/or surveys and registrations; sweepstakes and/or contest entries; and through the use of cookies. 

The information MAGIX collects is used in a variety of ways: for internal review; to improve the content of the site, thus making your user experience more valuable; and to notify customers about updates to the service and products. 

In connection with the use of our newsletter, we are collecting data on whether you have opened it, which information you use from it, and which information you do not find interesting. This will enable us to fine-tune our future offers according to your wishes. 

We are committed to protecting your privacy at MAGIX. We will not collect any personal information from you that you do not volunteer, and we are the sole owner of all information collected on this site. We do not sell, share, or rent this information with others, except affiliated companies which are controlled by MAGIX,Â  in any way that we have not mentioned in this statement. If at any time you change your mind and like to be removed from the list, please let us know by emailing us at: [webmaster@magix.net](mailto:webmaster@magix.net)

## OPT-IN EMAIL 

MAGIX provides for its users an "optional" email service that allows the user to request-through personal email-specific MAGIX information. At times we may request additional information for the purpose of improving this service or for facilitating the user's online experience. A user may request to be removed (or "opt-out") from this "opt-in" email at anytime by contacting us at: [webmaster@magix.net](mailto:webmaster@magix.net)

From time-to-time MAGIX, along with other reputable companies, may provide sweepstakes or other contests for the enjoyment of our users.
