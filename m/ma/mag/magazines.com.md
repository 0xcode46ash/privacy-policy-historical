**Our Privacy Guarantee**   
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this privacy policy explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we link to it from our home page and other pages of our web site.

Phone number 

**The Way We Use Information:**   
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete the order. It is necessary to furnish this information to the publisher in order to quickly fulfill your order, provide you with discounted subscription rates, and qualify you for free magazine subscription offers. We also use the information to provide you with information about magazine subscriptions and other products and services. We may also provide your information to other businesses which may sell other products and services. Because your information is shared with third parties, the information is governed by the privacy policies of the recipients of the information. **Magazines.com does not share email addresses with third parties.**

Furthermore, by placing an order with Magazines.com or registering for the Magazines.com Instant Win Game Sweepstakes promotion, you are agreeing to receive promotional mailings and emails from us. Each email from us will contain opt-out information. If you choose to opt-out, then you will be removed from our email list and will receive no future emails from us. 

**Cookies**   
Although we use cookies for web site optimization reasons, we do not use cookies to collect any personal information (cookies are small files downloaded to your computer to record movements within web sites). 

**Tracking**   
We do use tracking software to observe user traffic patterns throughout our site. But we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. Tracking information is used only to determine which areas of our site users like and don't like, and how well each page performs on behalf of our guests. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We also monitor search terms and titles entered at our site as a means of knowing what interests our customers. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters. 

**Security**   
When you place orders, we provide the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you enter before it is sent to us. And all customer data we receive is protected against unauthorized access. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

**Fair Credit Billing Act**   
We guarantee that every online transaction you make will be 100% safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at our online store. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, We will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures. 

**How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information**   
You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by contacting us through our toll-free number at 1-800-929-2691. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. 

**How To Contact Us**   
If you ever have any questions about what information we collect and how we use it, please contact us through our [online request form](http://www.magazines.com/ncom/mag/help/contactus.html) or send email to [ feedback@magazines.com](mailto:feedback@magazines.com).
