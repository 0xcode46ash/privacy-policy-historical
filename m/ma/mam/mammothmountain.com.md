# Privacy Policy - Mammoth Mountain

  1. Security
  2. Information Collection
  3. Changing Profile and Opting Out
  4. Cookies
  5. Non-Use and Disclosure
  6. Children's Privacy
  7. Legal Liability



## Security

"Clearance" and a "need to know" form the basis for our security policy. "Clearance" is not enough to view secure information; an employee must also have the "need" to see that information. Clearance means that an employee has gained the trust of our organization through dedicated service. By enforcing both "clearance" and a "need to know" we limit those who have access to your personal information and we can easily enforce accountability.

Mammoth Mountain has gone to great lengths to ensure the security of your financial information such as credit card and other booking information. All credit card transactions are handled on separate secure servers. Only authorized employees have access to these servers and your personal information that resides on those servers.

## Personal Information Collection and Use

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with outside organizations. Mammoth asks you to provide information that will enable us to enhance your site visit, process your order correctly, and if necessary, follow up with you before or after your visit.

We will request information from you when you:

  * Register on MammothMountain.com
  * Plan a trip to Mammoth Mountain
  * Place an order with Mammoth Mountain
  * Provide feedback in an online survey
  * Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer
  * Subscribe to a newsletter or a mailing list
  * Create your online guest profile
  * Participate in loyalty or club card programs
  * Purchase specific services such as rentals, lessons, and lodging



In each of these instances, we may ask for any of the following types of information: name, e-mail address, phone number, address, birthdate, customer and trip preference information, customer ID and password, as well as other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers.

Additionally, we may collect data to better understand your preferences. This information allows us to improve our products and services, and to offer you specially tailored deals when appropriate.

We may ask for an age or birth date when applicable for guest identification and pricing purposes (for instance, children and seniors qualify for discounts on lift tickets) and when creating your online guest profile. Federal law prohibits discrimination in public accommodations based on age, so when we send out information on lodging bookings we are required to treat all site members equally, regardless of age.

## Changing Profile and Opting Out

If you chose to not receive promotional material or special offers from us including but not limited to e-mail, direct mail or telephone, we ask that you tell us by opting out if given the choice or by calling us at 760-934-0745. You have the ability to create a guest profile by clicking on manage profile in the footer below and creating a personal preferences profile. Creating a guest profile enables you to customize your interaction with Mammoth by choosing or changing your preferences, updating your information, opting in or out of direct mail and e-mail communication at any time.

Please note that in the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to unsubscribe from these mailings at any time by updating your preferences in your guest profile.

When you register and create your account using the internet, we will confirm your registration by sending an email to the address that you supplied to us. All future emails to your account will contain information on how to remove you from our distribution lists.

We may also use personal account information to generate statistics and aggregate reports for internal use and for sharing with affiliates. These statistics and aggregate reports will not contain any personally identifiable information. Your identity is kept anonymous.

Aggregate information may be used to design programs and promotions that we think would be of interest to an identified group of customers. For example, if an analysis of purchase data shows that 30% of our guests are intermediate skiers who rent equipment, we may want to develop a special rental/lesson program for them to test new gear.

## Internet Tracking using Cookies

Depending on how you configure your browser, when you visit MammothMountain.com a small file (a "cookie") is stored on your hard drive. Whenever you log onto MammothMountain.com our server looks for your cookie and may make adjustments in order to customize what appears as you browse our site. If your browser is set to reject cookies, none of this customization is possible. 

## Non-Use and Disclosure

We do not and will not sell, rent, or share your information to any outside entity. Please remember that anything posted on our forums becomes public information and you should exercise caution about disclosing personal information on those pages.

Mammoth Mountain reserves the right to cooperate with local, provincial, federal, and international officials in any investigation requiring either personal information (including any information provided on-line through MammothMountain.com) or reports about lawful of unlawful user activity on this site.

Mammoth Mountain also reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time.

## Children's Privacy

Mammoth Mountain does not knowingly solicit data from, or about, people under the age of 16 years for the purposes of selling directly to these individuals. Mammoth Mountain assumes that visitors to our site are adults.

## Legal Liability

Under no circumstances, including, but not limited to, negligence, shall Mammoth Mountain be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, including, but not limited to, loss of data or profit, arising out of the use, or the inability to use, the materials on this site, even if Mammoth Mountain or a Mammoth Mountain authorized representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
