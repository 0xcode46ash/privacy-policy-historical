# Mamma.com - The Mother Of All Search Engines

As a leading Internet Search Engine, Mamma.com respects your right to privacy. We understand the sensitive nature of privacy issues and we will try to ensure that your confidentiality is protected.

Our privacy policy is detailed below and we ask you to read it in full.

You can use Mamma.com without revealing any personal information. The majority of our services do not require any form of customer registration. 

We require registration for participation in our affiliates, advertising and partnership programs. These services cannot be offered without first receiving certain information, such as your contact details. If you are not willing to provide us with such information you may choose to not participate in these programs. If you wish to solely use the Mamma.com meta search engine you will not be required to fill out any form of registration. 

During your use of our site, we may collect demographic and profile data. This data is used so we may enhance your experience at our site (i.e. showing you content that you may be interested in according to your preferences). We may share this information with selected advertisers and sponsors. If you do not wish demographic or profile information to be shared, then you may opt-out at the time of registration. At no time will information that personally identifies you or enables an advertiser to communicate with you directly be distributed to any third party.
