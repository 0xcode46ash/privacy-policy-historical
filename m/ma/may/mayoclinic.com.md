# MayoClinic.com - Medical and health information for a healthier life from Mayo Clinic

MayoClinic.com is committed to protecting your online privacy. We feel it is important for you to know how we handle the information we receive from you via the Internet. In general, you can visit www.MayoClinic.com without revealing any personal information. However, you may be required to provide personal information to gain access to some of our content and services, as explained below.

   


| How we and our affiliates collect and use personal information |   
---|---  
  
Registering with MayoClinic.com gives you access to all the site's information and features. The only information required for registration is your e-mail address, gender and year of birth.

MayoClinic.com may contain links to Web sites operated by third parties, such as the site located at www.Healthe-Store.com. MayoClinic.com has no control over the privacy policies and practices of such third party sites, and if you have any concerns, you are urged to review the terms of those sites for more information about the policies applicable to those sites.

 

We collect and log the IP address of all visitors to MayoClinic.com. An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. IP addresses allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with one another. We collect IP address information so we can properly administer our system and gather aggregate information about how our site is being used, including the pages visitors are viewing. This aggregate information may be shared with advertisers, sponsors and other businesses. To maintain your anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information. We will use IP address information, however, to personally identify you in order to enforce our legal rights or when required to do so by law enforcement authorities.

 

As you probably know, "cookies" are small pieces of information that some Web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you visit them. Like many other Web sites, MayoClinic.com uses cookies to provide us with information relating to the sources of our site traffic. Collecting this information, however, does not allow us to personally identify you.

Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis. Our site requires that both cookies and javascript be enabled. If you reject cookies from our site, the functions and conveniences of our site may not work properly.

   


Registration, health risk assessment and health management information |   
---|---  
  
We collect personal information that you choose to share with us in the registration, risk assessment and health management portions of our site. This information may include e-mail addresses and your answers to questions. We collect this information only with your permission, and you may update it or delete it at any time. This information allows us to personalize our services to focus on your individual health interests and needs. The personal information we collect also allows you to use our health management programs on a recurring basis.

 

As a registered user of MayoClinic.com, you may be asked to complete surveys from time to time. We use information from surveys to create reports on healthcare trends in general, or healthcare issues in certain areas of the country, and we may share this information with marketing research firms with whom we have a business relationship. If you agree to participate in a survey, you will be asked to review and accept certain additional terms and conditions relating to use of the information you furnish, because it may include personally identifiable information. The terms and conditions for survey completion are in addition to the privacy policies listed in this section of the Web site.

   


How to update or delete your personal information |   
---|---  
  
Once you have registered with our site, you can update the information in your "profile" at any time by logging in and visiting the Update my profile page. You can delete your profile completely by clicking on the link at the bottom of the Update my profile page under the heading: Delete my profile. Deleting your profile will remove you from our user database, and you will no longer receive the information you had requested when you registered. 

You should be aware, however, that it's not technologically possible for us to remove from our servers every record of the information you've provided to MayoClinic.com. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your personal information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Nevertheless, we promise that upon receiving your deletion request, all personal information stored in the databases we actively use for research and daily business activities, and other readily searchable media, will be deleted. 

**Remember:**

  * Unsubscribing from our e-mail newsletters will not delete your profile information. 
  * If you are a registered user and you do not log in to the site for a period of one year, your personal profile will be automatically deleted from our database.

   


How we protect your personal information |   
---|---  
  
All personally identifiable data that you enter on this site is encrypted with secure server software (SSL). The encryption means that your data is protected while it is being transferred over the Internet to our servers.

Once your data reaches our servers, the same state-of-the art security software that guards our company's essential business data protects your personal data as well.

In addition to using the most secure technology available, we work hard to make sure that any information you provide will be de-identified before it is used in any aggregate reporting that may be done.

   


What we provide to third parties |   
---|---  
  
MayoClinic.com does not provide any third-party access to your personal information except in the aggregate and only after the information has been de-identified to make all end-result information anonymous. We may provide third parties with aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns and related site information. This data reflects site usage patterns gathered during customer visits to our Web site each month, but it does not contain behavioral or identifying information about any individual member unless that member has given us permission to share that information.

Sponsors, partners or advertisers on the MayoClinic.com site may use cookies when you click on their advertisement or link to their site or service. We do not control these third parties' use of cookies or how they manage the non-personal information they gather through them. We are also not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. You should read the privacy policies of each site you visit to determine what information that site may be collecting about you. 

 

We use general traffic, site usage and length of stay information in reports to advertisers and firms with which we have a business relationship. This sort of information is shared only on an aggregated basis and does not personally identify you.

 

This site is intended for adults age 18 and over. It is not intended for or designed to attract persons under the age of 18. We do not permit registration by, nor do we collect personally identifiable information from, any person we actually know to be under the age of 18.

   


E-mail communications, newsletters and related services |   
---|---  
  
MayoClinic.com provides you with the opportunity to receive communications from us or third parties. At registration time, you have the option of signing up for motivational e-mail messages that will be sent only if you choose to participate in one or more of our online health management programs. If you would rather not receive these messages, simply indicate that preference either when you register or at any time you update your profile. You can also sign up for free e-mail newsletters on topics of interest to you. You may unsubscribe from these newsletters at any time.

E-mail communication that you send to us via the e-mail links on our site may be shared with a Customer Service representative, employee, medical expert or agent that is most able to address your inquiry. We make every effort to respond in a timely fashion once communications are received. Once we have responded to your communication, it may be discarded or archived, depending on the nature of the inquiry.

The e-mail functionality on our site does not provide a completely secure and confidential means of communication. It's possible that your e-mail communication may be accessed or viewed by another Internet user while in transit to us. If you wish to keep your communication private, do not use our e-mail.

You may decide at some point that you no longer wish to receive communications from our site. To stop receiving communications, send an e-mail message to [comments@mayoclinic.com](mailto:comments@mayoclinic.com) or send regular mail to the following postal address:

Security and Privacy Officer  
MayoClinic.com

If you have a complaint or problem, or if you believe your privacy rights have been violated, you may e-mail us by clicking on the Contact us link at the bottom of any page. Please indicate the following reason for contacting us: I want to provide feedback about your site. Our Customer Service department will forward your complaint to the appropriate MayoClinic.com department for response or resolution.

Changes to our privacy and security policies |   
---|---  
  
Privacy as it applies to the Internet is a dynamic, rapidly developing area. In the future, we may make significant changes to our Privacy policy affecting the use of the personal information we collect. We do not notify users of these changes, so you should check the posted Privacy policy each time you access our site.
