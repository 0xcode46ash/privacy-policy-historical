# Privacy Policy - Mayo Medical Laboratories

We respect the right to privacy of all visitors to the www.mayomedicallaboratories.com Web site. We do not collect information that would personally identify you unless you choose to provide it. The personal information that you submit is shared only with those people in the Mayo organization who need this information to respond to your question or request.

We generally do not ask for information in surveys that would personally identify you; if we do request contact information for follow-up, you may decline to provide it. If survey respondents provide personal information (such as an e-mail address) in a survey, it is shared only with those people who need to see it to respond to the question or request.
