This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we 1) collect, record, restore and/or disclose certain User information and communications that you authorize through selecting and enabling a User Profile, and 2) how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us.  This Privacy Policy is intended to assist you in making informed decisions about using our site and our services.  In addition, it also constitutes all disclosure necessary for your informed consent.

By enabling a User Profile, the Primary Administrator is specifically authorizing us to intercept, collect, and/or record certain communications by, and information about, the User of that Profile (collectively “Profile Data”).  Profile Data may include 1) websites visited by the User, 2) information, images or documents downloaded by the User, 3) the User’s e-mail communications through the Service, and 4) the User’s communications sent through the Service by Instant Messenger or similar methods.   The Profile Data is logged and stored by our secure database for thirty (30) days and then automatically deleted. 

As part of the Service, the Primary Administrator can activate or de-activate this authorization at will, and can also adapt this authorization to desired levels.  The Profile Data is also made available for the Primary Administrator’s review and/or disclosure.  The only other persons with access to the Profile Data are Max’s Vice President of Technical Operations and its Lead Engineer.  Those persons will only access the database and the Profile Data contained therein as required in the ordinary course of its business.  We will not otherwise use or disclose the Profile Data, except as provided herein.  If you have any questions or concerns about effect or use of any User Profile, or the Profile Data collected, recorded or stored by us, please contact management@Max.com.

By creating the User Profile, the Primary Administrator consents to the interception, collection, recording, and disclosure of the User’s Profile Data as described herein. In creating and authorizing a User Profile, the Primary Administrator also confirms that he or she is the Custodial Parent or Legal Guardian of any minor for which a User Profile is created. 

By using the Service, you are also acknowledging and consenting to the interception, collection, recording and disclosure of the Profile Data, as determined by the Primary Administrator in the User Profile.

The above-stated consents of the Primary Administrator and/or User shall waive any and all privacy rights that the User might otherwise have, including but not limited to those arising under federal, state or common law, and shall specifically waive any rights created by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 2510 et seq. (1998 and as amended); federal provisions concerning the disclosure of stored electronic communications, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2701 et seq., and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501-06 (as amended).

When you generally use our Service, you may provide us with two other types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis, and use information collected on an aggssi1ate basis as you and others use our Service.

  1. _Personal Information You Choose to Provide_


    * _Credit Card Information_



If you choose to purchase products or services from us or our partners, you may need to give personal information and authorization to obtain information from various credit services. For example, you may need to provide the following information:

Name

Mailing address

E-mail address

Credit card number

Home and business phone number

Other personal information (i.e., mother’s maiden name)

E-mail Information

In addition to providing the fossi1oing information to our partners, if you choose to correspond further with us through e-mail, we may retain the content of your e-mail messages together with your e-mail address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.

2.         _Use Information_

Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Service utilizes a standard technology called “cookies” (see explanation below, “What Are Cookies?”) and Web server logs to collect information about how our Service is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent using our Service. This information is collected on an aggssi1ate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an individual.

    * _How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?_



Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Service, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. The lists used to send you product and service offers are developed and managed under our traditional corporate standards designed to safeguard the security and privacy of our customers’ personal information. As a customer, you will be given the opportunity, at least once annually, to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers.

    * _What Are Cookies?_



Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. They are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s Web browser on the user’s hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user’s transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.

    * _How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?_



We use Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to gather information about our Service users’ browsing activities in order to constantly improve our Service and better serve our customers. This information assists us to design and arrange our Service in the most user-friendly manner and to continually improve our Service to better meet the needs of our customers and prospective customers.

Cookies help us collect important business and technical statistics. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users of our Service.  Web server logs allow us to count how many people use our Service and evaluate its capacity.  We do not use these technologies to capture your individual e-mail address or any personally identifying information about you although they do permit us to send focused online banner advertisements or other such responses to you.

    * _Sharing Information with Affiliates_



From time to time you may notice offers from outside companies advertised on our Web site. We take measures to select product or service providers that are responsible and afford privacy protections to their customers. However, we cannot make any representations about the practices and policies of these companies.

    * _Sharing Information with Strategic Partners_



We may enter into strategic marketing alliances or partnerships with third parties who may be given access to personal information including your name, address, telephone number and e-mail for the purpose of providing you information ssi1arding products and services that we think will be of interest to you. In connection with strategic marketing alliances or partnerships, we will retain all ownership rights to the information, and we will not share information ssi1arding your social security number or other personal financial data.

    * _Notice of New Services and Changes_



Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Service, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. As our client, you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers by clicking on a response box when you receive such an offer. 

    * _How Do We Secure Information Transmissions?_



When you send confidential personal credit card information to us, a secure server software which we have licensed encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. The information is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches our Service.

Other e-mail that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as Social Security or account numbers to us through an unsecured e-mail.

    * _How Do We Protect Your Information?_



3.            _Information Security_.

We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction.

4.            _Evaluation of Information Protection Practices_.

Periodically, our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing the security, confidentiality and quality of our information.

5.            _Employee Access, Training and Expectations_.

Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of customer information. In general, our business practices limit employee access to confidential information, and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized persons, processes and transactions.

    * _How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?_



You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by e-mailing management@Max.com.

    * _Do We Disclose Information to Outside Parties?_



We may provide aggssi1ate information about our customers, sales, Web site traffic patterns and related Web site information to our affiliates or reputable third parties, but this information will not include personally identifying data, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.

    * _What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?_



We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights.

    * _What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?_



We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Service nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Service. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Service to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites which have a link to our Web site, is subject to that Web site’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.

    * _Your Consent_



By using our Service you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy & User Consent. If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our Web site to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.
