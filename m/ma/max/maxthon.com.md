# Privacy Policy - Maxthon Browser

### Privacy Policy

Maxthon Asia Limited (Maxthon) is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its users. 

The purpose of this Maxthon privacy policy is to inform you of the types of information we may gather about you when you visit Maxthon.com, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. This privacy policy applies to the Maxthon site and the Maxthon browser. This policy applies only to Maxthon, and not to other companies' or organizations' websites to which we link or to other products that may be distributed with the browser. You should carefully review the privacy policy of these other sites and products.

#### Information About All Maxthon Websites Visitors

In general, our site automatically gathers certain usage information like the number and frequency of visitors to the Maxthon site. We only use such data in the aggregate. This aggregate data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, so we can improve our site. Maxthon uses a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how many people. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through these cookies with other personally identifiable information to discover who you are or your e-mail address. We also may provide statistical information, never information about you personally, to our Maxthon partners about how our users, collectively, use Maxthon. We do not collect any information on the sites visited using the browser. Finally, Maxthon, its advertisers and ad servers may also use cookies, as well as small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs", to determine on an anonymous basis which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them, but we do not use these technologies to collect personally identifiable information.

#### Information About You 

We may specifically ask for information about you when you download or use the browser. We may use that information to let you know of additional products and services you may find interesting and worthwhile. You can choose not to receive such information if you don't want to by letting us know on the registration screen. We may also use cookie technology in order to improve your experience by recording your preferences or customized settings when you use Maxthon and its related services, and to authenticate your access to your personal information. 

The browser has the ability to gather certain information concerning your computer system but it will only send this information to Maxthon if you chose to send it by clicking on the Report to Author tab under Help. If you choose to provide feedback to us, this data will be sent to the Maxthon Browser team who will use the information for such purposes as diagnosing performance issues, improving the reliability of the download and install process, and improving its products and services to users generally. This feedback information from the browser will only be tied to your email address should you choose to provide it and will not be tied to any other information that would identify you personally. Information regarding websites you have visited or added to your bookmarks list is stored by the browser locally on your hard drive for your convenience. The browser does not provide Maxthon with information about your Internet navigation history.

During the installation process, or at some time thereafter, you may be asked to provide certain information that Maxthon will use to personalize content presented to you through the browser. For example, you may be asked for your Zip or postal code, which could be used by the browser to provide you with relevant local weather and/or news reports. The information gathered by the browser will not be tied to any information that would identify you personally. The websites you visit, including those of advertisers, have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of Web sites before providing them with any of your personal information. 

#### Disclosure 

We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to Maxthon or information that you may give us on Maxthon, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any outside companies or governmental agencies. Maxthon may share such information in response to legal process, such as a court order or subpoena. And, as we mention above, we may share with our website partners aggregated statistical information about the use of Maxthon. 

#### Maxthon Privacy Policy Changes 

If we decide to change our privacy policy for Maxthon, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
