## MAXXIS INTERNATIONAL PRIVACY POLICY

Maxxis International (“Maxxis”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting Maxxis’ Web site, or using or purchasing any of our products or services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.

 **WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?**  
This Privacy Policy covers Maxxis’ treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that Maxxis gathers when you are accessing Maxxis’ Web site and when you use or purchase Maxxis products and services. Also, this Privacy Policy covers Maxxis’ treatment of any Personal Information that Maxxis’ business partners share with Maxxis. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Maxxis does not own or control, or to individuals that Maxxis does not employ or manage.

 **WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES MAXXIS COLLECT?**  
The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers.

 _Personal Information You Provide to Us:_

  * We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected includes Name, Address, City, State, Zip Code, day and night phone numbers, e-mail address, date account opened, total purchases year-to-date, and all transactions. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new products. 

  
_Personal Information Collected Automatically:_

  * We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Web site or services. Maxxis automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Maxxis cookie information, and the page you requested. 
  * Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Maxxis only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Web site or services so that we can make the Web site appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Web site, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Maxxis never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally. 
  * Many companies offer programs that help you to visit Web sites anonymously. While Maxxis will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available. 

  
_Email Communications:_

We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Maxxis if your computer supports this type of program. Maxxis uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please [contact us](http://www.maxxis.com/contact_us/comments.asp). 

_Personal Information from Other Sources:_

For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.

 **WHAT ABOUT COOKIES?**

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Maxxis cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is. 
  * Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.

## ESTORE PRIVACY POLICY

Welcome to the Maxxis Web Site (“Site”). Please review the following basic terms that govern use of and purchase of products from our Site. Please note that your use of our Site constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by those terms (the “Agreement”). If you have not already done so, you may click on the following links to read about our privacy and security policy, return policy, warranty information, payment and shipping method, and terms and conditions of use. 

**PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY** All comments, feedback, suggestions, ideas, and other submissions disclosed, submitted or offered to Maxxis on or by this Site or otherwise disclosed, submitted or offered in connection with your use of this Site (collectively, “Comments”) shall be and remain Maxxis’ property. Maxxis is and shall be under no obligation (1) to maintain any comments in confidence; (2) to pay to user any compensation for any Comments; or (3) to respond to any user Comments. 

You agree that no Comments submitted by you to the Site will violate any right of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy or other personal or proprietary right(s). You further agree that no Comments submitted by you to the Site will be or contain libelous or otherwise unlawful, abusive or obscene material. You are and shall remain solely responsible for the content of any Comments you make. 

You agree that Maxxis may use and/or disclose information about your demographics and use of the Site in any manner that does not reveal your identity. By participating in site sweepstakes, contests, promotions, and/or requesting promotional information or product updates, you agree that Maxxis may use your information for marketing and promotional purposes. 

To the extent that this Site contains links to outside services and resources, the availability and content of which Maxxis does not control, any concerns regarding any such service or resource, or any link thereto, should be directed to the particular outside service or resource. These links are provided for the customer’s convenience, therefore any risk is assumed by the customer. 

**Credit Card Liability**  
Per the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. However, in the event of unauthorized use of your credit card number, you must notify your credit provider in accordance with the reporting rules and procedures listed in your account agreement. 

**SECURITY**  
Protecting your order information is our priority. Maxxis makes every effort to protect your online order information. Maxxis holds a Secure Server Certificate from VeriSign, the leading provider of Internet Trust Services. The Maxxis E-Store incorporates SSL (Secure Socket Layering), which protects all communications with our customers, so we can take credit card orders, and protect your sensitive personal information. 

SSL security makes eavesdropping on web traffic almost impossible. SSL encrypts order information to avoid the decoding of that information by any party other than Maxxis. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower portion of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock, depending on your browser, then SSL is active. You can also double check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from “http” to “https.” The “s” means it is secure. 

Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don’t permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you will be unable to connect to the server so you won’t have to worry about mistakenly placing an order through an unsecured connection. If you can’t access the secure server for whatever reason, please place your order by phone, at 1.800.4.MAXXIS, Monday-Friday, 8am-5pm (EST).
