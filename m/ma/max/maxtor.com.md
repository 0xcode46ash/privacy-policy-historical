Maxtor.com Information  
Â 

At Maxtor Corporation, we not only value your business, we respect your privacy. That's why whenever you visit us at Maxtor.com, you'll never have to worry about whether or not information you share with us will be used without your permission.

When you send us email, submit a request for technical support or register for a service through our website, you will sometimes be asked to provide certain information. This is collected only to help us serve you, and will be used only for that purpose.

From time to time, Maxtor may provide information on its customers to other companies or organizations we feel may be of interest to you. This is only true in cases where we stipulate at the time you provide us with the information we might do so. Maxtor will never distribute or sell information to other companies without first specifying to you, the user, that we intend to do so and giving you the opportunity to tell us you do not wish for your information to be shared. In these cases, Maxtor will always honor your request.

At Maxtor, our goal is to ensure you have a positive experience every time you contact the company - whether in person, on the telephone or on the web. To that end, we will sometimes use cookies to help us evaluate your experience on our site. Cookies are a harmless method of tracking data through your web browser. They can only be downloaded by the site which issues them. Usually, the cookies you receive from Maxtor.com will expire when you end your browser session. Your web browser can be set to notify you when you are receiving a cookie and you can then decide whether or not to accept the cookie.

In addition to cookies, Maxtor uses web server logs to evaluate our web site and to discover what you find helpful and what you don't. The information in our server logs cannot be used to identify you personally. Essentially, at Maxtor.com, you will remain anonymous until you decide to provide us with personal information.

Maxtor reserves the right to change its privacy policy at any time, and will post any revisions on its website located at [www.maxtor.com](http://www.maxtor.com/).
