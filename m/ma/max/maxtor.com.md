# Maxtor.com - Privacy Statement

As one of the world’s leading suppliers of information storage solutions, Maxtor understands the value of information and has a deep respect for your privacy.  We are pleased to provide this Privacy Statement to inform you of our practices concerning the collection and use of information about visitors to Maxtor web sites.   Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [privacy@maxtor.com](mailto:privacy@maxtor.com).  


**Sites Covered By this Privacy Statement**

This Privacy Statement applies to websites and domains owned by Maxtor or its wholly owned subsidiaries.  


**Personal Information**

In general, you can visit Maxtor on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself.  There are times, however, when we or those we work with may need personal information from you.

You may choose to provide us with personal information in a variety of situations.  For example, you may want to provide us with information, such as your name and address or e-mail id, to send us e-mail, process an order or rebate, submit a request for technical support, participating in an online survey, contest or training, or register for a service.  You may give us your credit card details to buy something from us or a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at Maxtor.   This information is collected only to help us serve you, and help us better understand your needs and interests.  


Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction or order, to communicate with you, to provide service and support, and to update you on services and benefits.  Occasionally we may also use your information to contact you for market research regarding Maxtor® products or services.  We give you the opportunity to choose your privacy preferences for such communications.  If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so.  


Personal data collected online may also be combined with information you provide Maxtor through other sources such as product registration, call centers or public events such as trade shows or seminars.  Personal data given to Maxtor may be transferred across state and country borders for purposes of data consolidation, storage and simplified customer information management.  


The following paragraphs describe in more detail how Maxtor may use your personal information and with whom we may share it.  Depending on the type of Maxtor web site you are visiting, one or more paragraphs may apply.  For example, if you order a product from the Maxtor MaxStore™ web site, your information will be handled as provided in the paragraphs related to Fulfilling Transactions and Marketing Use.  


**Fulfilling Transactions**

If you request something from Maxtor web site, such as a product or service, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request.  In particular, Maxtor uses its websites and email in connection with providing customer service and technical support.  To help us fulfill your requests and to provide services, we may contact you either in response to your inquiry or proactively about issues that affect you, share information with others, such as other parts of Maxtor, Maxtor business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal or government authorities (such as Customs authorities) involved in the fulfillment of the transaction.  In addition, in connection with such transactions, we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes. For the Privacy Statement specific to MaxStore, please see www.maxstore.com.

**Marketing Use**

From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest, such as electronic newsletters or information regarding Maxtor products, programs or promotions.  If you do not wish to receive these newsletters or information, please e-mail your request to [privacy@maxtor.com](mailto:privacy@maxtor.com).  


In addition, Maxtor may provide information on its customers to other companies or organizations we feel may be of interest to you. Before we use it for these purposes, however, we will either advise you of our proposed use at the time you provide us with the information or offer you the opportunity to “opt out” or “opt in”, as applicable, for such use.  Maxtor will not rent, lease, distribute or sell information that you provide to us to other companies for such marketing purposes without first specifying to you that we intend to do so.  We will either give you the opportunity to elect not to provide that information to us in the first place or to tell us that you do not wish your information to be shared. Maxtor will always honor your request in this regard.  


**Careers and Employment**

In connection with a job application or inquiry, whether advertised on a Maxtor web site or otherwise, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as your resume.  We may use this information throughout Maxtor and its related entities for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry.  Except where you tell us not to, we will keep the information for future consideration.  


**Maxtor Business Partner**

If you represent a Maxtor business or channel partner, such as a Maxtor VIP reseller or systems integrator, you may visit a Maxtor web site intended specifically for Maxtor business partners.  We may use information provided on that site to administer and develop our business relationship with you, the Maxtor business partner you represent, and/or Maxtor business partners generally.  For example, this may involve using your information to send you details of Maxtor business partner programs.  It may also include sharing certain information with other Maxtor business partners (subject to any confidentiality obligations that may exist), or Maxtor customers or prospective customers.  In particular with a particular transaction or program, we may also contact you as part of customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.   We may use an agent or other third party to conduct this survey or market research for us.  


**Maxtor Suppliers**

If you represent a Maxtor supplier, you may visit a Maxtor web site intended specifically for use by Maxtor suppliers. We may use the information provided on that site in connection with entering into or conducting a transaction with you.  For example, this may include sharing information with other parts of Maxtor, Maxtor’s business partners, customers, shipping companies, financial institutions, or postal or government authorities involved in the fulfillment.  It may also be used to administer and develop our relationship with you, the supplier you represent and/or other Maxtor suppliers generally.  


**Other Notices**

In some cases, specific Maxtor web sites, such as www.maxstore.com, may contain other notices about their use and the information practices applicable to those sites.  


**Worldwide Access**

Maxtor is a global enterprise, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross international borders.  Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information across the world.  We may share your personal information within Maxtor and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business.  Countries provide varying levels of legal protection for your information.  In any case, we will handle the information at least in the manner we describe in this statement.  


**Information Security**

Maxtor is committed to protecting the personal information that you provide to us and maintain its quality.  We implement and maintain reasonable security processes and practices appropriate to the nature of the information you supply to us, such as physical, technical and managerial procedures and means, to help us keep your information secure, and to maintain its quality.

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting and transferring sensitive data such as credit card information.  SSL encryption is designed to make the information unreadable by unauthorized parties.  This security measure is working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window.  


**Supplemental Information**

From time to time we may supplement information you give us through a Maxtor web site with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other business information.  This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide a better service.  


**Use of Suppliers**

In some cases Maxtor uses suppliers to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf.  Maxtor’s practice is for that information to be handled consistent with Maxtor’s policies.  


**Strategic Transactions**

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Maxtor decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries.  Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers.  It is Maxtor’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in those types of transactions.  


**Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies**

We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our web sites to help us provide better customer service.  For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on Maxtor sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable.  This information is sometimes known as “click stream data.”  Maxtor or others on Maxtor’s behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.  


Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as click stream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns.  This information is not reviewed at the individual level.  If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you may disable your cookies.  


We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one-called “cookies.”  A cookie is a piece of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer.  Some Maxtor pages use cookies, sent by Maxtor or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the web site. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.  You can also set your browser to turn off cookies.  If you do so, however, some web sites will not work properly.  


Some Maxtor web sites may also use web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service.  These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across Maxtor’s web sites.  When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or our suppliers.  These web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies.  If you don’t want your cookies information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies.  


If you turn off cookies, web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded.  


**Service Quality Monitoring**

Certain web transactions may also involve you calling us or our calling you.  Please be aware that Maxtor may monitor or record such calls for staff training or quality assurance purposes.  


**Personalized Web Sites**

On occasion, we may personalize and customize web sites for certain visitors.  If you visit one of these sites, you may find it customized with references to products and/or services that we believe may be of interest to you, based on your previous interactions with Maxtor and the information you have provided us.  While you are visiting these web sites, we may collect information about your visit to better tailor the site to your interests.  


**Children**

Maxtor’s web sites are not directed at and are not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information about visitors to our site who are under 13 years of age.  If we discover personal information from a child through the Maxtor web site we will delete that data.  Further, if you are the parent or guardian of a minor under 18 years of age and believe that they have disclosed personal information to us, please contact [privacy@maxtor.com](mailto:privacy@maxtor.com) so that we can delete the minor’s information. Children may use the Maxtor web site only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.  


**Disclosures Required by Law**

Please be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders or as otherwise required by law.   We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is necessary for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance.  


**Links to non-Maxtor Web Sites**

Maxtor web sits may contain links to other web sites.  Maxtor is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other web sites.  


**Statement Changes**

Maxtor reserves the right to change its Privacy Statement at any time, and will post any revisions on its website located at [www.maxtor.com](http://www.maxtor.com/).   A notice will be posted on our Web site home page for 30 days whenever this Privacy Statement is changed in any material way.  We encourage you to review our Privacy Statement regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this web site or Maxtor's services will be subject to the then-current privacy policy.  This Privacy Statement was last updated on February 4, 2005.
