# MaxPreps: - High School Sports

_Effective Date: October 5, 2006_

This privacy policy (“Policy”) is applicable to the MaxPreps website located at [http://www.maxpreps.com](http://www.maxpreps.com/) (the “Web Site”) and all associated products and services available on the Web Site (the “MaxPreps Services”).  This Policy summarizes MaxPreps’ data collection policies and practices on the Web Site.  This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that MaxPreps does not own or control, or to people that MaxPreps does not employ or manage. 

**What Information We Collect/How We Use It**   
We store and use the information you give us in accordance with the terms of this Policy.  Personal information including your first and last name, mailing address, birth date, zip code, gender, the category of your user membership (e.g., coach or athlete), email address, cell phone number, username, and password may be collected via the Web Site.  These categories of information are required when you register on the Web Site. 

When you register for additional MaxPreps Services on the Web Site, additional personal information may be collected.  We use this additional data to personalize your MaxPreps experience. By obtaining and using this information, we can provide you with the most timely, relevant and individualized service according to your preferences and interests.  In addition, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to your personal information.

When you register with the Web Site, MaxPreps also records your decision to: (1) receive email updates from your favorite school; (2) receive email updates from MaxPreps; and (3) have a third-party sponsor contact you to provide information regarding their product or services.

In some instances we may include certain links in our emails that will allow us to monitor whether you access specific content or advertisements contained in that email.  When you click on one of these links, we will record that click and certain activities on the web page associated with that link.  We use this information to conduct internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior related to our email advertisements and content, and to better understand and serve you. 

We use log files to track system activity and maintain our systems.  Log data includes IP addresses, browser type, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number and nature of clicks through our Web Site.  We use this information to analyze usage patterns, observe trends, administer the Web Site, track user movements in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  Log files are not linked to personally identifiable information.

We may use your submitted email address to compare our member list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending identical messages to our members. 

We use information collected on the Web Site in the following ways: 

  1. to provide you with personalized information via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;
  2. to send you targeted advertising via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;
  3. to contact you for feedback and surveys via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;
  4. to send you general and administrative information about your MaxPreps membership via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;
  5. to provide your contact information to MaxPreps marketing partners whose offer(s) you have selected to receive in order for them to send you special offers via electronic delivery, telemarketing and direct mail; and
  6. to share your contact information if you select to have such information shared with schools or third parties.



**Agents**  
We may employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from customer lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing analysis. These agents have access to member personal information as needed to perform their functions for MaxPreps, but we do not permit them to use it for other purposes.

**Cookies**  
We use cookies to, among other things, save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Web Site and to deliver personalized content. Many web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You may change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is about to be placed on your computer. Please note, however, that rejecting cookies while visiting the Web Site may result in certain parts of the Web Site not operating correctly or as efficiently as if they were allowed.  For example, if you are a MaxPreps member, you may need to enter your username and password each time you visit the Web Site. 

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.

**Third-Party Ad Servers**  
Most advertisements you see on the Web Site are served to your web browser by MaxPreps. However, MaxPreps allows other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Web Site or through MaxPreps Services. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.  We only authorize our third-party ad networks to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any personally identifying information about you.

MaxPreps may also include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by MaxPreps to assist with auditing, research and reporting for advertisers.   
Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.  If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad network's web site individually and opt out (if they offer this capability).  Please contact us if you would like additional information regarding the specific third-party ad networks used on the Web Site.

**Disclosures**  
MaxPreps may disclose information about you and your use of the Web Site and the MaxPreps Services if MaxPreps believes such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with the law or legal process; (ii) to protect or defend the rights or property of MaxPreps or others; (iii) to enforce the MaxPreps Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy; and (iv) to respond to claims that the content(s) of a communication violates the rights of another.  In addition MaxPreps may share or transfer information about you and that you provide to MaxPreps, to one or more third party entities pursuant to a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a portion, or all of, the assets or stock of MaxPreps or its affiliated entities, or as otherwise provided herein. 

**Security**  
MaxPreps takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users’ information.  When you submit sensitive information via our service, your information is protected both online and off-line.   We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you.  However, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and MaxPreps will not be intercepted by others and that information stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access.  While we have taken reasonable precautions to protect this information, you should always use discretion in what information you send to us and not expect that such information will be absolutely free from intrusion.  If you have any questions about the security of our service, please contact us.

**Children**  
MaxPreps is committed to the safety of children.  Children under the age of 13 may not register or participate in any of the MaxPreps Services.  If children under 18 elect to register in any of the MaxPreps Services, they should ask a parent for permission before sending any information to the Web Site. We will not request or knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from a child under 13. 

**Reports**  
We periodically prepare analyses and reports reflecting visitor and member use of the Web Site and MaxPreps Services for our internal use as well as for a limited number of our business partners.  These reports include aggregate (non-personal) information about MaxPreps members, and in certain instances, visitors to the Web Site. The information in these reports will not identify you individually.  Our business partners who have access to these reports will not be able to contact you from the information contained in the reports. 

**Referral Program**  
As part of our referral program, you can provide contact information including the name, the particular school of interest, and e-mail address of your friends and family whom you think would like to receive MaxPreps e-mails and use the MaxPreps Services.  The users referred to us receive sample MaxPreps e-mails, but do not become members until they confirm their interest in the service. 

**Links**  
You should be aware that when you are on the Web Site or when you receive emails sent as part of MaxPreps Services, you could be directed to other sites beyond our control.  This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the Web Site's logo. These other web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.  If you visit a site that is linked from our Web Site or a MaxPreps’ email, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information.

**Sweepstakes and Contests**  
We may conduct sweepstakes and contests on the Web Site in which we may ask you for additional information. We use and treat this information in accordance with the terms of this Policy. 

**Changing Your Status**  
As a convenience to our members, we provide a number of different opportunities to review and change information in your profile and to unsubscribe from MaxPreps Services entirely. For example, you can go to the Web Site and log into your profile page to make any desired changes.  To have all of your personally identifiable information removed from our database, send an e-mail request to [info@maxpreps.com](mailto:info@maxpreps.com).  Please be advised that by requesting that your data be removed from our database, you will be unsubscribed from MaxPreps Services. 

**Notification of Changes and Your Acceptance of the Privacy Policy**  
By using this Web Site, you signify your agreement to the terms of this Policy.  If there are material changes to our privacy policy or if we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated when it was collected, we will post a link to our revised privacy policy on our home page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  Your continued use of this Web Site shall constitute your acceptance of any revised privacy policy.
