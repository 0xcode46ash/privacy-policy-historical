Please browse our Privacy Policy below to find answers to any questions you may have. If you cannot find the answer to your question, feel free to contact us.

This privacy policy ("Policy") discloses the data collection and use practices of MaxPreps ("MaxPreps") in connection with the MaxPreps website, www.MaxPreps.com (the "Web Site") and all associated MaxPreps products and services (the "MaxPreps Services").

**What Information We Collect/How We Use It**  
We store and use the information you give us in accordance with the terms of this Policy. Our registration form (or registration information you provide our marketing partners if you joined MaxPreps though one of our partners) requests that you provide certain contact and profile information (like your name, e-mail address, and zip code). Some of the requested information is required in order to receive MaxPreps Services; other information is optional. The required information is indicated as such on the registration pages of the MaxPreps Web Site. Depending on the specific MaxPreps Services for which a user registers, certain category specific information will be requested. We use this additional data to personalize your MaxPreps experience. By obtaining and using this information, we can provide you with the most timely, relevant and individualized service according to your preferences and interests.  
Other than the information we require in order to provide one or more MaxPreps Services to you, you do not have to provide any further information. But your election to withhold certain information will limit the value of the MaxPreps experience for you. The more information we have about you, the more valuable the MaxPreps experience will be for you.  
In addition, we might receive information about you from outside sources and add it to your MaxPreps membership information. We do this to improve personalization of our services (for example, providing better regional content, advertising or special offers that we think will interest you).   
We also may collect information such as the identification of the server your computer is logged onto and whether you opened a MaxPreps e-mail delivered to you. We also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending identical messages to our members. You can add and modify certain parts of the information you have provided by following the instructions set forth below. (See change status)

We use all this information in five ways:   
1) to provide you with personalized information via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;   
2) to send you targeted advertising via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;   
3) to contact you for feedback and surveys via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;   
4) to send you general and administrative information about your MaxPreps membership via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; and   
5) to provide your contact information to MaxPreps marketing partners whose offer(s) you have selected to receive in order for them to send you special offers via electronic delivery, telemarketing and direct mail. 

We do not send or support the delivery of unsolicited bulk e-mail (a.k.a. "spam"). 

**Agents**  
We may employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from customer lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing analysis. These agents have access to member personal information as needed to perform their functions for MaxPreps, but we do not permit them to use it for other purposes. 

**Cookies**  
We use cookies to, among other things, save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the MaxPreps Web Site and to deliver personalized content. Many Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You may change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is about to be placed on your computer. Please note, however, that rejecting cookies while visiting the MaxPreps Web Site may result in certain parts of the MaxPreps Web Site not operating correctly or as efficiently as if they were allowed. For example, if you are a MaxPreps member, you may need to enter your username and password each time you visit the MaxPreps Web Site.   
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. 

**E-mail Links**  
In some instances we may include certain links in our e-mails that will allow us to monitor whether you access specific content or advertisements contained in that e-mail. When you click on one of these links, we will record that click and certain activities on the Web page associated with that link. We may use this information for various purposes, such as to conduct internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior in and to our e-mail advertisements and content, and to better understand and serve you. 

**Disclosures**  
MaxPreps may disclose information about you and your use of the MaxPreps Web Site and the MaxPreps Services if MaxPreps believes such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with the law or legal process; (ii) to protect or defend the rights or property of MaxPreps or others; (iii) to enforce the MaxPreps Terms and Conditions or this Privacy Policy; and (iv) to respond to claims that the content(s) of a communication violates the rights of another. In addition MaxPreps may share or transfer information about you and that you provide to MaxPreps, to one or more third party entities pursuant to a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a portion, or all of, the assets or stock of MaxPreps or its affiliated entities, or as otherwise provided herein. 

**Security**  
The MaxPreps Web Site has security measures in place intended to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our hardware infrastructure is housed in a controlled access facility that restricts access to authorized individuals with positive identification. Our network access to the infrastructure is protected by a firewall protection system. Member information is backed up on a periodic basis to protect against accidental loss. However, we can not guarantee that communications between you and MaxPreps will not be intercepted by others and that information stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access. While we have taken reasonable precautions to protect this information, you should always use discretion in what information you send to us and not expect that such information will be absolutely free from intrusion. 

**Children**  
MaxPreps is committed to the safety of children. Children under the age of 13 may not register or participate in any of our services. If children under 18 elect to register in the MaxPreps service, they should ask a parent for permission before sending any information to the site. We will not request or knowingly collect any Personally Identifiable Information from a child under 13. 

**Reports**  
We periodically prepare analyses and reports reflecting visitor and member use of the MaxPreps Web Site and MaxPreps Service for our internal use as well as for a limited number of our business partners. These reports include aggregate (non-personal) information about MaxPreps members, and in certain instances, visitors to the MaxPreps Web Site. The information in these reports will not identify you individually. Our business partners who have access to these reports will not be able to contact you from the information contained in the reports. 

**Referral Program**  
As part of our referral program, you can provide contact information (such as the name and e-mail address) of your friends and family whom you think would like to receive MaxPreps e-mails and use the MaxPreps Service. The users referred to us receive sample MaxPreps e-mails, but do not become members until they confirm their interest in the service. 

**Links**  
The MaxPreps Web Site, as well as the electronic messages sent as part of the MaxPreps Service, may contain links to other sites or services. MaxPreps is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party sites. If you have a question about the privacy policy of those other sites, please contact them directly. 

**Sweepstakes and Contests**  
We may conduct sweepstakes and contests on the MaxPreps Web Site in which we may ask you for additional information. We may also ask for information about referrals; see "Referral Program", above. We use and treat this information in accordance with the terms of this Policy. 

**Changing Your Status**  
As a convenience to our members, we provide a number of different opportunities to review and change information in your profile and to unsubscribe from the MaxPreps Service entirely. For example, you can go to the MaxPreps Web Site and log into your profile page to make any desired changes. To have all of your personally identifiable information removed from our database, send an e-mail request to [info@maxpreps.com](mailto:info@maxpreps.com) At the current time, we are not able to offer users the direct ability to delete their information from our database, but we will be happy to delete such information after we receive a request to that effect. Please be advised that by requesting that your data be removed from our database, you will be unsubscribed from the MaxPreps Service. 

**Updates**  
MaxPreps may revise this Policy from time to time and at any time in the future to (i) improve or modify the MaxPreps Service, (ii) reflect future developments in MaxPreps data information gathering, storing and release practices, (iii) comply with applicable laws, and (iv) reflect changes in MaxPreps business structure. Depending on the nature of the change, we will notify users by e-mail (to the current e-mail address on file) and/or placing a notice on the MaxPreps Web Site. 

If you do not accept the terms of this Policy, we ask that you not register with MaxPreps, or alternatively, send an unsubscribe request to [info@maxpreps.com](mailto:info@maxpreps.com)
