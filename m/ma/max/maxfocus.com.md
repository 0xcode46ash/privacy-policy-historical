Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the Website with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions; therefore, we cannot guarantee who will view or use your User Contributions. We are not responsible for circumvention by third parties of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or may have been copied or stored by other Website users.

Alternatively, you can also contact us at [legal@logicnow.com](mailto:legal@logicnow.com) if you wish to exercise these rights. While we will strive to accommodate your requests, we may reject requests which risk the privacy of others, are unreasonable or repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort or would be extremely impractical.

If you request that we delete your account we will do so within a reasonable period of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.

 **Where we store your personal data**

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside of the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

With respect to data transfers from the EEA to the United States or to other countries outside the EEA, we have taken steps to ensure adequate protection for such data transfers in accordance with European data protection legislation. We have entered into appropriate data transfer agreements based on the standard contractual clauses specifically approved by the European Commission for the purpose of providing adequate protection for data transfers between LogicNow entities outside the EEA, as necessary.
