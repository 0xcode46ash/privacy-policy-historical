# Privacy Policy

We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and we make it our highest priority to safeguard the confidentiality of any and all personal details you provide to us. As a visitor to our website you have the right to know and understand our information privacy practices prior to providing Maxymiser with any of your personal details.

## Information Collection and Use

If you submit a request for documentation or further information on our site, we require that you provide certain information, including your name, address, phone number & company name. We use this information as necessary to fulfil your request and to contact you.

We may collect information about your computer, including your referring URLs and access times. We use such information for system administration and to analyse trends. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

## Cookies

One of the biggest challenges of designing a great website is that you rarely get to meet the customers. At Maxymiser we help brands improve the way they serve customers online, just like your cafe around the corner gets to know what you like.

Maxymiser is the global expert in multivariate testing, personalisation and optimisation solutions. We help websites comply with the most recent European privacy regulations. The security of our technology has been rewarded with an ISO 27001-2005 certification. Our technology uses testing methodologies along with personalisation to help the people who run those sites design and improve your online experience.

To make websites more aware of your needs when browsing their site, cookies are used to distinguish you from other users by assigning you an ID. A cookie is a small file containing a combination of letters and numbers that is stored on your computer by your web browser and is key to how most web sites work. The cookies that Maxymiser uses are known as “first party cookies” and are classified as “analytical cookies”. They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors to see how visitors browse around the site. People running the sites can then understand things that don’t work well and find better ways to serve you. Maxymiser never shares data or observations with anyone outside of the website owner and the data is used at an aggregated level so it does not and is never used to identify you. We don’t work in the online advertising industry who use ‘third party cookies’. We only work on web sites – so for instance we do not generate pop-up adverts or adverts (re) targeting you on third party websites. You can find below more information about each individual cookie and how to recognise them:
