### 4\. Cookies

  
"Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record keeping purposes.  The cookie assigns you an ID which allows Auckland Transport to recognise you when you return to one of our websites.  We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests so users do not have to register each time they use our websites.

We may retain all personal information that we collect (on both our active systems and our archive systems), for as long as is necessary for us to carry out the purposes for which the information was collected (including for the purpose of providing services to you). For registration and account information, this means that the information is likely to be retained for the period of time that we consider your account (registered card or online account) to be "active". An "inactive" card is where the card is not used and no Stored Value or Period Passes are added to the card for a continuous period of 2 years.
