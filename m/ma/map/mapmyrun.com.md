 **1\. What is personal information?**   
"Personal information" is information that you provide to us that personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, location information, billing information, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information by MapMyFitness. 

**2\. What is a MapMyFitness Account?**   
You may access some of our services by signing up for a MapMyFitness Account (to access MapMyRun, MapMyRide, MapMyWalk, and the other MapMyFitness sites) and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address and a password). This account information will be used to authenticate you when you access MapMyFitness services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. We may share personal information among our various services in order to customize content and enhance our services for you. No account information is shared with anyone other than MapMyFitness except as specified in the Privacy Policy or with your consent. You can edit or terminate your account at any time through your [MapMyFitness Account settings](https://web.archive.org/web/20120505033545id_/http%3A//www.mapmyrun.com/edit_profile). 

**3\. What is a cookie?**   
A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. 

**4\. What are server logs?**   
Like most Web sites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when users visit our sites. These "server logs" typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. 

**5\. What information does MapMyFitness receive if I click on a link displayed on MapMyFitness?**   
When you click on a link displayed on MapMyFitness, the fact that you clicked on the link may be sent to MapMyFitness. In this way, MapMyFitness is able to record information about how you use our site and services. 

We use this information to improve the quality of our services and for other business purposes. For example, MapMyFitness can use this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. Similarly, MapMyFitness can use this information to determine how many times an advertisement is clicked in order to calculate how much the advertiser should be charged. 

**6\. What is sensitive information?**   
"Sensitive personal information" includes information we know to be related to confidential medical information, racial or ethnic origins, location, political or religious beliefs or sexuality and tied to personal information. 

**7\. What is aggregated non-personal information?**   
"Aggregate non-personal information" is information that is recorded about users and collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user. 

**8\. URLs and embedded information**   
Some of our services, including MapMyFitness route tools and MapMyFitness search queries send the uniform resource locators ("URLs") of web pages that you request to MapMyFitness. When you use these services, MapMyFitness will receive and store the URL sent by the web sites you visit, including any personal information inserted into those URLs by the web site operator. 

**9\. What protections do I have against intrusions by the government into my use of MapMyFitness services?**   
MapMyFitness does comply with valid legal process, such as search warrants, court orders, or subpoenas seeking personal information. These same processes apply to all law-abiding companies. As has always been the case, the primary protections you have against intrusions by the government are the laws that apply to where you live. 

**10\. Third-party advertising.**  
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>
