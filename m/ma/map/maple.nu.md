## Privacy Policy

Maple.nu is committed to protecting your online privacy while providing you with the most useful and enjoyable Web experience possible. Generally speaking, you can use Maple.nu without providing personally indentifiable information. When we do need your personal information to provide additional and/or optional services at your request, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information. Maple.nu firmly respects your right to personal privacy, and we will collect and use information through our Web site only in the ways disclosed in this statement. 

**Part I: Information Collection**

_General Overview_

For the most part, you will not need to provide any private, personally identifiable information to use Maple.nu. 

In the course of normal operation, our server does collect and process a large number of not personally identifiable information such as IP addresses, browser type, browser language, and the date and time of your visits. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. This information is used primarily to operate our service, and at times, to develop and improve our services. 

We do track and catalog global usage information to determine and continuously refine the relevancy of our service as well as to analyze which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. 

_Registration_

Registering a personal account is required to make full use of the Maple.nu service, such as submitting news and voting. Upon registration to the service, you will be asked to provide a valid email address. We will use this email for the purpose of registration, welcoming you to the service and providing you with password recovery services. We will not use your email for any other purpose and we will not disclose, share or sell your email address to third-parties unless required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process or governmental request (such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order). 

A valid email will be required at the time of registration. Upon request we will provide site registered users with access to the information that we maintain about them. 

_Cookies_

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that some Web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you visit them. Maple.nu uses cookies as the basis for a number of personalized and/or customized features. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, you can reset your browser at any time to refuse or delete all cookies. However, some Maple.nu features or services may not function properly without cookies. 

**Part II: Information Security**

Maple.nu takes information security very seriously. We aim to protect user information and prevent unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. Furthermore, we strictly limit access to your personally identifying information only to those employees on a strict need-to-know basis in order to operate, develop or improve our services. 

You do, however, agree that Maple.nu may disclose any information it may collect about you, including the content of your emails, if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process or governmental request (such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order). Personal information collected by Maple.nu may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which parent company Maple.nusoft Inc. or its agents maintain facilities. By using Maple.nu, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.  
**Part III: Third Party Sites**

We offer links to other Web sites. Please note that third party sites may have privacy standards that differ from ours. We do not control the content on any third party site, and we encourage you to read the privacy policies on third party sites when you click on their links. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer and/or collect personally identifiable information. 

**Part IV: Changes to this Privacy Policy**

This policy is subject to change without prior notice. Any changes or updates to our privacy policy will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
