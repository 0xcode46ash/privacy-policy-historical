The Seychelles is one of the most popular honeymoon destinations in Africa, which is why it is often perceived as an expensive vacation.

While this isn’t an incorrect observation, it’s not exactly the entire truth either.

The most expensive thing about Seychelles will be your flights and your accommodation. However, with a little planning and research, you can easily visit Seychelles on a more frugal budget as well.

Having recently visited the Seychelles for a solo trip, I was easily able to manage 2 weeks here for 730 USD. Here are a few tips that can help you manage a budget-friendly trip in this exotic location too.

Whether you’re capturing holiday memories of your trip, or you secretly want to launch a career as a travel videographer, simply tapping the record button on your iPhone isn’t going to guarentee a high quality video.

For budding phone videographers, there are two main factors that are going to dictate how good your videos are. The first is the quality of footage.

The newest technology will always be the best way to guarentee you’re shooting the highest quality footage, but anything that is capable of shooting in 4K, 120fps/240fps high speed or slo-mo videos will work well.

The second is the quality of editing that goes into your video after it’s been shot. With these two points in mind, we’ve put together the following tips for making and editing awesome travel videos on your iPhone.

## [Why Private Tours in Paris are the Best Way to Explore … Led by Localers of Course!](https://www.mappingmegan.com/private-tours-in-paris-led-by-locals/)

2018 has seen a shift in the way people travel. Movements towards responsible and ethical travel experiences are revolutionizing the travel industry, and right there with it is a trend to seek out more meaningful experiences, and focus on local travel.

And by local travel I don’t mean exploring your own backyard (though there’s a case to be made for that too!), I mean delving deeper into a country or city, and escaping the typical tourist circuit and main landmarks.

Really being able to experience a city … and here’s the buzz word … like a local!

We’re not all fortunate enough to have friends based in every city, but in terms of having access to someone who can show you the real side of their city, there’s definitely something to be said for paying a local to show you around.

This is especially true for a well trodden destination like Paris; private tours in Paris, led by locals, are a great way to experience a city from a more authentic point of view.

From my seat here in Australia, Black Friday sales have not typically mattered to me.

As my friend Vanessa Chaisson wrote: “I reject the manipulation of capitalism and societal pressure which leads to environmental destruction, communities ravaged by debt, and non-ironic acid washed jeans.

I am a minimalist committed to supporting local businesses and the betterment of my community. I have been blessed with abundance this year and I need nothing more.”

But when I heard about Hotels.com offering 50% off hotels for Black Friday this was also me:

“Holy s&%t. Black Friday sales also apply to TRAVEL?????!!!”

In today’s age of social awareness, travelers are increasingly aware of the environmental impact in tourism.

A recent revolution which prioritizes responsible travel has swept up the travel industry, and it is becoming more and more difficult to ignore that irresponsible travel choices have a long-lasting effect on our planet.

But ecotourism goes beyond taking steps to reduce our carbon footprint, and if you’re truly committed to reducing your environmental impact, this should reflect in more basic choices too; like the fabrics you choose when purchasing travel clothing.

Having recently been named one of Lonely Planet’s Top 10 cities for 2018, Canberra has been receiving a lot of hype and attention.

Rare among Australia’s large cities in that it isn’t situated along the coast, Canberra is instead flanked by wild nature reserves where iconic wildlife roams, surrounded by wine country, and picturesquely nestled alongside Australia’s highest alpine peaks.

The well thought out and completely planned city may be nearly a 2 hour’s drive from the closest beach, but we found Canberra to offer more than enough excitement within the city to keep us entertained and not needing sand beneath our feet.

With a perfectly positioned base for exploring Australia’s bush capital in Pacific Suites Canberra, go behind the political scenes and discover a beautiful city surrounded by the calls of bushland wildlife that easily drowns out the shouting of MPs!
