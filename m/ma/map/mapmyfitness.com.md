# User Privacy Policy | MapMyFitnessMapMyFitness

At MapMyFitness we recognize that privacy is important.  This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) sets forth how MapMyFitness, Inc., and/or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies (collectively, “MapMyFitness,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) protect a User’s’ privacy when he or she uses any of the MapMyFitness websites, MapMyFitness mobile applications, or other products, services, and/or websites offered by MapMyFitness.

* * *

**General Scope And Import Of Privacy Policy**

This Policy explicitly applies to any customer, user, or other person  (the “User,” “Users,” or “You”) who employ or access the MapMyFitness iMapMy mobile applications (the “Mobile Applications”), the MapMyFitness affiliated websites-www.MapMyFitness.com, MapMyRide.com, MapMyRun.com, MapMyTri.com, MapMyWalk.com, MapMyMountain.com or MapMyHike.com-(collectively, “the MapMyFitness websites” or “MapMyFitness.com”), or any other MapMyFitness products, services, features, User-generated and other MapMyFitness generated content and interactive and informational resources or promotional offers (all of the aforementioned are collectively, the “Services”).

In addition, this Policy directly applies only to the personal information and location information (as both terms are defined below) that a User discloses or transmits to MapMyFitness via the MapMyFitness websites or the Mobile Applications, or that is collected by MapMyFitness in the course of the provision of the Services.

* * *

**User Consent To The Privacy Policy**

By using a MapMyFitness website that displays this Policy, a User expressly agrees to the collection, use, and disclosure of certain personal information and location information as set forth in this Policy.  If a User does not consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of his or her personal information or location information as described in this Policy, he or she is not permitted to use the site.

* * *

**Incorporation**

This Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the MapMyFitness Terms and Conditions of Use.  A User’s use of the Services and his or her provision of any personal information or location information to MapMyFitness are subject to the terms of this Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use.  
If a User has any questions about this Policy, he or she may contact us via our online support page found at support.mapmyfitness.com.

* * *

**Information We Collect And How We Use It**

We offer a number of Services that do not require a User to register for an account or provide any personal information or location information to us, such as MapMyFitness Basic Route Creation Tool.

In order for a User to gain means of access to and use our full range of Services, he or she may be required to provide the following types of information:

* * *

**Personal Information A User Provides**

When a User signs up for a MapMyFitness Account or other MapMyFitness Services that require registration, we ask him or her to submit select personal information.  Personal information is any information that identifies a User personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us.  Personal information may therefore include, but is not limited to:

  * A User’s name, email address date of birth, and /or account password;
  * The phone number assigned to a User’s mobile device along with other pertinent information concerning said device, including the name of the applicable wireless carrier/provider,
  * Certain data concerning a User’s health and physical characteristics; and
  * Any content a User posts to a MapMyFitness website, as defined in the MapMyFitness Terms and Conditions of Use.



* * *

**Financial Information A User Provides**

For certain Services, MapMyFitness requests a User furnish certain financial information, including but not limited to, a credit card or other payment account information that we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers.  Any such financial information furnished by a User expressly falls within this Policy’s definition of personal information.  Moreover, that personal financial information is not accessible to any third parties except those specified by the User.

* * *

**Location Information A User Provides**

Some of the Services feature or include various location-based components.  To provide these location-based features, MapMyFitness and our partners and licensees may collect, use and share a User’s precise location information, including the real-time geographic location of a User’s mobile device. For some third-party partners, such as Google, this location information will be shared automatically. For others, such as Facebook, this information will only be shared with a User’s explicit permission or if you choose to share it..  Location information includes, but is not limited to, any information we derive in order to identify a User’s geographic position.  This information may be collected from a User’s wireless carrier, certain third party service providers, or directly from the mobile device that the User previously registered for use with MapMyFitness.  The collection and tracking of a User’s location information may occur even when the MapMyFitness mobile phone application is not actively open and running.  A User’s location information, however, is only displayed and shared in accordance with his or her established privacy settings.

We may combine the personal information and/or the location information that a User submits under his or her account with information from other Services or third parties in order to provide that User  with an enhanced experience and/or to improve the overall quality of the Services.  For certain Services, we may give a User an opportunity to opt out of the combination of such information.

* * *

**Other Information a User Provides**

When a User employs the Services, MapMyFitness may receive certain personally non-identifiable information about the User’s use of the Services. Such information, which may be collected passively using various technologies, or via submission of data by fitness devices the User may have configured to work with the Services, cannot presently be used to specifically identify the User. MapMyFitness may store such information ourselves or it may be included in databases owned and maintained by our affiliates, agents or service providers. MapMyFitness may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to the Services, the number of visitors to each page of the Services, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. No personal information is available or used in this process.

* * *

**Aggregated Information**

To better serve Users and improve the Services, MapMyFitness may conduct research on User demographics, interests and behavior based on the personal information and other information provided to MapMyFitness. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregated information with our affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify a User personally. MapMyFitness may also disclose aggregated information in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

* * *

**Cookies**

When a User visits MapMyFitness.com, We send one or more cookies-small text files that contain a string of characters-to a User’s computer that uniquely identify his or her browser.  Cookies do not identify a User personally, but these files are linked with other information that could personally identify a User.  More importantly, cookies permit MapMyFitness to offer a User more personalized Services and online experiences.  In addition, we use cookies to improve the quality of The Services by storing User preferences and tracking User trends, such as how people search.  Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but a User can reset his or her browser to reject all cookies or to provide an alert when a cookie is being sent.  Some MapMyFitness features and Services, however, may not function properly if a User has disabled cookies.

* * *

**MapMyFitness Privacy Settings and Online Disclosures**

MapMyFitness provides its Users with three privacy setting options for their accounts-”Public,” “Friends Only,” and “Private.” These privacy settings control who can view a User’s online disclosures, including certain Users personal information and location information.

MapMyFitness sets User default privacy settings to “Friends Only.” A “Friends Only” privacy setting limits access to a User’s online disclosures. Only certain personal information that a User discloses and/or transmits to MapMyFitness via the MapMyFitness Websites and/or the Mobile Applications—specifically, MapMyFitness user name, first name and first initial of the last name, and any profile picture or associated with a MapMyFitness User—while that User maintains a “Friends Only” privacy setting, is disclosed or accessible to the general public. All other personal information and/or location information that a User discloses and/or transmits to MapMyFitness is only disclosed to and accessible by only those persons who that User has previously designated as “Friends” and MapMyFitness.

A “Private” privacy setting further limits access to the personal information and location information that a User discloses and/or transmits to MapMyFitness via the MapMyFitness Websites and/or the Mobile Applications.  Specifically, no personal information or location information that a User discloses and or transmits to MapMyFitness while that User maintains a “Private” privacy setting, is disclosed to, or accessible by, that User’s Friends or the general public. Said information is only disclosed to and accessible by the User and MapMyFitness.

To permit the general public or any third parties, including other Users, to view a User’s online disclosures, a User must actively and specifically employ a “Public” privacy setting; save his or her routes as “Public”; or otherwise use or access Services that require a User to make use of a “Public” privacy setting. Further, a User should be aware that certain personal information or location information that he or she voluntarily discloses online by means of his or her employment of Services that require a “Public” privacy setting may become publicly available and could be read, collected, and/or used by third parties, including other Users, in ways unknown to MapMyFitness. MapMyFitness is not responsible for any such use of a User’s personal information or location information by any third party. MapMyFitness therefore recommends that a User actively manage his or her privacy settings on an ongoing basis, so that he or she can effectively guard against the unauthorized use or abuse of his or her personal information or location information by others.

* * *

**Log File Information**

When a User accesses or uses the Services, our servers automatically record information from that User’s mobile device and web browser.  These server logs may include, but are not limited to, information such as a User’s web requests, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of that User’s request, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, cookies that may uniquely identify a User’s browser, and elements employed in the Mobile Applications.

* * *

**User Communications**

When a User sends an email or other communication to MapMyFitness, we may retain those communications in order to process that User’s inquiry, respond to his or her request, and improve the Services.

* * *

**Affiliated Sites**

We offer some of the Services in connection with other Partners. Personal information that a User provides to a Partner or its affiliated website may be sent to MapMyFitness in order to deliver the Services. We process such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Partners and their affiliated websites may have different privacy policies governing User personal information and we encourage Users to review such privacy policies. In addition, in the provision of select services – specifically, Tour de France All Access – MapMyFitness may share the personal information that a User provides with NBCUniversal Media LLC and its affiliated website (www.nbcsports.com). Any personal information submitted by MapMyFitness to NBCUniversal Sports Media, LLC and its affiliated website will be processed by that entity in accordance with its Privacy Policy.

* * *

**Links**

MapMyFitness may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed.  We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content, and advertising.

* * *

**Other sites**

This Privacy Policy applies to the affiliated websites and the Services that are owned and operated by MapMyFitness.  We do not exercise control over the third party websites displayed as search results or links from within our various Services.  These other third party websites may place their own cookies or other files on a User’s computer, collect data, or solicit personal information from a User.   The links from the Services do not imply our review or endorsement of the third party websites.  We encourage Users to contact those third party websites directly for information concerning their privacy practices.

* * *

**Use Of Personal Information And Location Information**

MapMyFitness only processes and uses personal information and location information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or any specific privacy notices set forth for select Services.  In addition to the above, such purposes include:

  * Operating, maintaining, and providing Users all of the features of the Services, including the display of customized content and advertising;
  * Providing the basic functionality of the Mobile Applications, such as displaying a User’s live location and movement;
  * Employing “reverse geo-coding” and a User’s IP address, or saved location information to provide Users with specialized route and event content;

**Choices For Personal Information  
**  
When a User signs up for a particular Service that requires registration, we may ask that User provide certain personal information or location information.  If we use this personal information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask the User for his or her specific consent prior to such use.  If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer a User an effective way to opt out of such use of personal information for such identified other purposes.  We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained a User’s prior consent.

In addition, a User may decline to submit personal information or location information to any of the Services; consequently, however, MapMyFitness may not be able to provide certain Services to the User. absent the  provision of such personal information or location information.

**Business Transfers And Sharing of Personal Information**

Personal information submitted to MapMyFitness will become part of our normal records.  If MapMyFitness becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of any or all of its assets, we will provide notice before User personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.  In the negotiation of any potential merger, acquisition, or sale of MapMyFitness, may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information.  Such information does not identify a User individually.  In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, we may not be able to control how User personal information is treated, transferred, or used.  Upon any such change in ownership or control User personal information, however, will be notified via electronic notice via the Services

This type of information includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the MapMyFitness websites, such as community forums (collectively, “Public Areas”), any ideas for new products or modifications to existing services, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”), including all User Content, as that term is defined in our Terms and Conditions of Use, that by its nature is accessible or intended to be accessible to other Users of the Services. All such Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.

**Information Security**

MapMyFitness takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of the personal information and location information transmitted or disclosed to MapMyFitness.  These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where User data is collected, stored, and/or maintained.  No Internet or e-mail transmission, however, is ever fully secure or error free.  MapMyFitness therefore  cannot warrant or ensure the security of any personal information and location information that we receive on behalf of Users in order to permit them to access the Services, or any other information that a User transmits or discloses to us.  We also cannot guarantee that any such information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.  Therefore, a User should take special care in deciding what information is transmitted or disclosed to MapMyFitness.  We restrict access to personal information and location information to MapMyFitness employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve MapMyFitness.com or the Services.  These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

* * *

**Data integrity  
**  
MapMyFitness processes User personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice.  We review our data collection, storage, and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve the Services.  We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our Users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.

* * *

**Accessing And Updating Personal Information**

When a User accesses MaqpMyFitness.com or the Services, we make good faith efforts to provide that User with easy access to his or her personal information and an opportunity to either correct that data if it is inaccurate, or to delete such data upon that particular User’s request, provided that it is not otherwise required to be retained by law, or for legitimate business purposes.  We do, however, ask Users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected, or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required.  In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.  Some of the Services have different procedures to access, correct or delete a User’s personal information.  We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these Services.

* * *

**Third-Party Advertisers And Ad-Serving Companies**

Advertisements that appear on MapMyFitness are sometimes delivered (or “served”) directly to Users by third-party advertisers or ad network companies (collectively, the “Third Party Advertisers “).  Third Party Advertisers may automatically receive a User’s IP address or other information about his or her mobile device or personal computer when serving advertisements.  They may also download cookies to a User’s computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and “web beacons” to measure the effectiveness of the advertisements served and to personalize advertising content.  Doing this allows the advertiser or ad network to recognize a User’s computer or mobile device each time he or she sends a User an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of the ad and to personalize advertising content.  Further, Third Party Advertisers may use aggregated information (not including User’s name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to the MapMyFitness websites and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to Users. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.  MapMyFitness does not access or have control of the cookies that may be placed by third-party advertisers or ad networks.  Likewise, third party advertisers and ad networks do not have access to a User’s personal information stored with us unless a User chooses to share it with them.  This Policy does not cover the use of tracking technologies or personal information by any such third-party advertisers or ad networks.

* * *

**Privacy of Children**

MapMyFitness is neither directed at, nor targeted to children under the age of 13.  For that reason, we do not employ the MapMyFitness websites, Mobile Applications, or Services to knowingly solicit personal information or location information from to children under the age of 13.  IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.  If we learn that someone under the age of 13 has provided personal information or location information, MapMyFitness will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from our records.  We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Policy by instructing their children to never provide personal information or location information through any of our Services without their permission. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained a MapMyFitness User account, then you may contact us, and request that we delete that child’s personal information and location information from our systems.

* * *

**Children**

If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

* * *

**Enforcement**

MapMyFitness regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy.  Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or MapMyFitness’s treatment of personal information or location information by contacting us through the website.  When we receive formal written complaints, it is MapMyFitness’s policy to contact the complaining User regarding his or her concerns.  We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between MapMyFitness and an individual.

* * *

**Security**

When a User logs in to MapMyFitness and its affiliated websites, we require that a secure connection between a User’s computer and our server be established.  We use a technology called Secure Socket Layers (SSL), an encryption technology that works with most browsers.  A secure connection is maintained until a User leaves the secure area of one of a MapMyFitness website.  Although we use SSL encryption to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information as it travels via the Internet, ironclad security does not exist on the Internet, and accordingly, we cannot guarantee the safety of the transmission of any personal information over the Internet.

* * *

**Changes To The Policy  
**  
Please note that the Policy may change at any time and without prior notice.  Any revised version(s) of the Policy will be promptly posted on the MapMyFitness affiliated websites.

We will not reduce User rights under the Policy without each User’s explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be negligible.  To better inform Users of changes to the Policy, we will post any such changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification).  Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of Our Privacy Policy in an archive for review by Users.

A User’s continued use of the Services constitutes his or her agreement to this Policy and any future revisions.

If You have any additional questions or concerns about this Policy, please feel free to contact us any time.
