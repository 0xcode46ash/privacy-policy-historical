**1\. Privacy Policy**  
MapQuest.com is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. 

**2\. What personally identifiable information does MapQuest.com collect from me?**  
MapQuest.com may collect information in several ways from different parts of our network of Web sites. MapQuest may ask you for personal information at times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by MapQuest.com and/or our many partners; when you make travel arrangements using MapQuest.com; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. MapQuest.com also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for internal research. Wherever MapQuest.com collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. 

**3\. What are cookies and how does MapQuest.com use them?**  
As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, MapQuest.com may use cookies to store and sometimes track your information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and may be stored on your computer's hard drive. 

Generally, we use cookies to: 

| • |  | Store your personalized settings for items such as route language and default country forms.   
---|---|---|---  
| • |  | Determine whether you are using a public computer so that any MapQuest settings changed while using a public computer do not affect the next user's ability to use MapQuest.   
| • |  | To estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing MapQuest.com may be given a cookie that is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage and determine on an aggregate basis, which features of MapQuest are used. In order to gather these aggregate data, MapQuest may use cookies served by third parties.  
| • |  | Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a MapQuest.com-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings.   
| • |  | Measure certain traffic patterns; track the areas of MapQuest.com's network of Web sites you have visited, track the Web site through which you came to MapQuest.com and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on MapQuest.com a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites.   
| • |  | MapQuest.com also collects IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.   
| • |  | We use a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our Web site. This company may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visit to this Web site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by this company, please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/).  
| • |  | MapQuest.com and its advertisers may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These "web beacons" may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our anonymous cookie policy. MapQuest.com does not allow advertisers or their advertising networks to use these technologies on AOL to compile profiles about the different Web sites that a particular member visits.  
  
**4\. Who is collecting information?**  
When you are on a MapQuest.com site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information for use by MapQuest.com alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. Some MapQuest.com services may be offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide this service to you, it may be necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner company. In such cases you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. 

Promotions that run on MapQuest.com may be sponsored by companies other than MapQuest.com or may be cosponsored by MapQuest.com and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared.

Please be aware that MapQuest.com advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those Web sites linked to MapQuest.com are not covered by this privacy statement. 

**5\. With whom does MapQuest.com share my information?**  
As a general rule, MapQuest.com will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed. 

**Business Partners & Sponsors:** MapQuest.com may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Some or all data collected during a MapQuest.com promotion may be shared with a sponsor. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. 

Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give MapQuest.com permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared. 

**Third Party Data & Data in the Aggregate:** Under confidentiality agreements, MapQuest.com may match user information with third party data. Also, MapQuest.com discloses aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

**Other:** Under confidentiality agreements, MapQuest.com may match user information with third party data. Also, MapQuest.com discloses aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

**6\. What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?**  
If you express interest in receiving offers or information from MapQuest.com and our partners, we may occasionally send you e-mail or postal mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only MapQuest.com (or agents working on behalf of MapQuest.com and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers. 

At any time you can easily unsubscribe from MapQuest.com's mailing list and no longer receive such offers and mailings. 

On some types of MapQuest.com promotions, we will ask for your email address in order to update you on your score, entries, and status in prize drawings. When you participate in these types of promotions, you may automatically receive promotion-related email. Occasionally these promotion-related email messages may include targeted advertisements. 

You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those MapQuest.com services that require the use of cookies in order to participate. 

MapQuest.com does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer. If you do not wish to allow your data to be shared, you can choose not to use a particular service or not to participate in certain promotions or contests. 

**7\. How does MapQuest.com protect my personal financial information?**  
Keeping your personal financial information private is vitally important to us. As with all personal information, MapQuest.com will never rent or sell your personal financial information. Knowing that you use certain services or features may help us to offer you better and more relevant content and advertisements. But as with all personally identifiable information, we do not make this available to any third parties without your permission. 

Please note that there may be places on the MapQuest.com network of Web sites where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes. Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. 

**8\. What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?**  
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, MapQuest.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 

**9\. What about children's privacy?**  
Naturally, the safety of children is very important to us. Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to MapQuest.com, or to anyone online for that matter. MapQuest.com does not share personal information about users under the age of 13 with third parties and we do not sell or rent personal information about any of our users, regardless of age. In addition, MapQuest.com will not send any direct email offers to users who indicate they are under the age of 13 without first obtaining their parents' permission. 

**10\. What else should I know about my privacy?**  
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any registration information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
