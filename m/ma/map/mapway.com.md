# Privacy Policy and Permissions - Mapway

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use information you provide through our mobile apps and websites. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.

By using the app you agree to the collection, use and disclosure of information as described in this privacy policy.

This Privacy Policy was updated on 18th April 2017. We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy and the version available at the time you use our apps and websites will apply.

You can find a copy of our [Terms and Conditions here](http://www.mapway.com/terms-conditions/).

**Collection and Use**

When using our apps or websites we may collect the following information:

  * Preferences information you provide such as product or content interests, or communication or marketing preferences.
  * Usage activity about how you interact with us such as frequency of use, purchase history, what content you viewed and which areas of our apps or websites you visited.
  * Device or browser information, which may include mobile device identification, IP address, cookies and location.
  * As is true of most websites, we automatically gather information about your computer such as your browser type, referring/exit pages and operating system.



We use this information to:

  * Assess your needs to determine suitable products or services.
  * Send you informative push notifications when you are using our app. If you do not want these notifications, you can manage your preference through your mobile device settings.
  * Improve our apps and marketing efforts.
  * Conduct research and analysis.
  * Display content based upon your interests.
  * Deliver adverts and promotional messages within the app that can be removed with an In App Purchase.



**Information Obtained from Third Parties**

If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

**Sharing Your Information**

We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose your information if:

  * As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process.
  * When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a government request.
  * If Mapway is involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change of ownership or uses of your personal information as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.



The usage data we collect (see ‘Collection and Use’) will also be used by our analytic suppliers. You can review how they use your data by viewing their Privacy Policies through the links [ _Flurry  (Yahoo!)_](https://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.htm) and [ _Google_](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).

We may also share your information as anonymous or aggregate data with third-party advertising, marketing and analytics companies for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes. We do not provide third-parties with names, user names, phone numbers, or email addresses or other personally identifiable information.

**Location Services**

Some services in our apps make use of location-based data. Your location is only used when you have granted permission to do so and can be revoked at any time through your mobile device settings.

If you allow these services we may detect your current location. To achieve this, these services may use any of the following: Cell ID, GPS, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth Beacons.

We use this information to provide location-based services, not to identify you. Location services are used to:

  * Map routes and provide directions to locations that you specify.
  * Provide you with local search results.
  * Provide you content based upon your location.



We may also provide location information to third parties, including advertisers, in order to provide you with offers and contextual, relevant advertising.

In addition, and as with most location-enabled applications, we and our third-party partners may access your location any time your device is on, whether or not you are using the app itself. Changes to these setting can be made through your mobile device settings.

**Tracking and Ads**

We may provide to third party advertising partners, information about your activity on this or other apps and your location. These partners may collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities to provide you contextual advertising based upon your interests and activity.

**Android Permissions**

In addition to the above, Android 6.0 introduced a new permissions model which enables users to directly manage app permissions at runtime instead of install. Depending on the type of permission the app requests, the system may grant the permission automatically, or the system may ask users to grant the permission. Below are all those that our Android apps require, with a clear explanation for each.

LOCATION: This permission is needed to obtain your location when finding nearby stations using GPS only. GPS can be a little bit slower to initially locate you, but is usually more accurate.

BLUETOOTH: This permission is used by some of our apps when push notifications are installed and will include the app accessing Bluetooth.

PHOTO AND MEDIA: This permission is used by some of the apps for the sole purpose of delivering richer multimedia files which we use for advertising within the apps.

OTHER: In some of our apps permissions are used which will allow the app to run on the start-up of the device, this is when push notifications are installed in the apps. In some cases these permissions will prevent the phone from sleeping, so that push notifications can always be accessed. Push notifications will be sent to inform our users about major transport disruptions such as Tube strikes.

**What Steps Do We Take To Protect Your Information?**

While we take measures to protect your Information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration, despite our efforts, no security measures are impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

**Correcting and Updating Your Personal Information**

If you have ever given us personal information, either through signing up to one of our app newsletters or via the website, you can correct and update your information at any time. To ensure it is accurate, contact us at  _support@mapway.com_.

**Notification of Privacy Policy Changes**

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices.

We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
