**Visitor Information**  
During the process of delivering mapping content to you, Maps.com does not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address.

In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to Maps.com Club or to make a map purchase. In this instance Maps.com collects personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, Maps.com will not share any customer personal information with third-parties. What this means is that your personal information will not be shared or sold to other web sites. Additionally, Maps.com has internal security measures to minimize access to customer data for you protection. 

**Maps.com Customer Data**  
It is Maps.com pledge that customer data will only be used to gain a better understanding of what products and services our customers are interested in.
