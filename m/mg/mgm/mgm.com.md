# MGM - terms of use

**_Privacy Information_** ****

_**Information We Collect**_

Any information that you provide us voluntarily (e.g., user name, e-mail address, phone number) will be retained by us. If you choose to purchase merchandise through the MGM Sites, we collect information about your buying behavior. In addition, if you send us personal correspondence, such as e-mails or letters, or post messages on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. All such information collected by us (collectively, "Personally Identifiable Information") shall become our property throughout the world. If you would like to review or modify any part of your Personally Identifiable Information, you may e-mail us at [mgmonline@mgm.com](mailto:mgmonline@mgm.com) or visit the Update Profile area of the site.

_**Information Use**_

We do not sell, trade, or license Personally Identifiable Information. You may choose to opt out of receiving information from MGM or its family of companies (collectively, the "MGM Companies") by clicking the appropriate check box on interactive forms on our sites that collect Personally Identifiable Information.  
We may aggregate statistics, traffic patterns, and related site information and disclose such aggregate data to third parties for marketing, advertising, or other promotional purposes, but such aggregate data will not include any Personally Identifiable Information. By using the MGM Sites, you consent to such collection and use by us.  
You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas, that information can also be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other people.

_**Your IP Address and Our Use of "Cookies"**_

Certain non-personal information of visitors is recorded by the standard operation of our servers, including, without limitation, the URL that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you're using, and your IP address. Such information is primarily used to provide an enhanced on-line experience for the visitor.  
Some MGM Sites place a "cookie" in the browser files of each user's computer. A cookie itself does not contain any Personally Identifiable Information, but lets the computers remember that you have registered, if applicable, and saves your passwords, purchases, and preferences from the MGM Sites that you have visited.

_**Security**_

We store all information collected from your visits to the MGM Sites, including Personally Identifiable Information, in a secure environment using industry standard encryption and providing physical security for our data servers.

**We do not allow users under 13 years of age to be listed in our database, receive direct marketing communications from MGM Studios or receive any other third-party offers.**
