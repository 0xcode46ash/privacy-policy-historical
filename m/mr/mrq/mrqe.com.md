# MRQE: Privacy Policy

All visitors to MRQE retain complete anonymity by default. As pages are delivered, MRQE does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private properties. MRQE does, however, collect information which is specific to the technical details of your arrival at the site. Our web servers may note non-personally identifying details such as, but not limited to, your computer's IP address and operating and windowing systems, the type of browser you use, and your language preferences. This information is collected solely for customizing the pages delivered to you (minor differences for Unix/X vs. MS Windows users, for instance) and for estimating [site popularity](http://www.mrqe.com/stats/). 

There are instances where a visitor may provide specific personal information in response to a survey, or as part of a future optional user customization process. For surveys, MRQE (or a third party working in conjunction with MRQE) acquires this information to help with the marketing of the web site, or to assist in the building of a [demographic profile](http://www.mrqe.com/survey/survey.html) with the purpose of attracting appropriate advertisers. In such cases, the privacy policy statement of this third party will be made available. Any potential user customization would be, of course, optional, and the information collected would serve to improve the quality of the visitor's experience. 

The privacy policy statement of our primary advertising broker, BURST!, is available [ here](http://www.burstmedia.com/release/privacy.asp).
