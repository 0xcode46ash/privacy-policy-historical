# Ask Mr. Rebates - Privacy Policy

  | 

#### 

As part of the operation of AskMrRebates.com, we gather certain types of information about AskMrRebates.com users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather and what we do with it.

#### Information Collected by AskMrRebates.com

AskMrRebates.com collects two types of personally identifying information from users: a user's e-mail address and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns on AskMrRebates.com).

#### Personal Data

Only a user's email address is collected when users provide registration to AskMrRebates.com. You agree that AskMrRebates.com may send you periodical emails promoting coupons, specials and other affiliated services that may be of interest to you.  Email addresses are never shared or sold to third party marketers.

#### Aggregated Information

Aggregated information, such as which page users access or visit and information volunteered by users, is collected through various methods. For example, AskMrRebates.com collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers (the computers that "serve up" Web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from AskMrRebates.com, our servers log your IP address. AskMrRebates.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide aggregate data to advertisers about the volume of use on AskMrRebates.com.

 **Use of Cookies**

AskMrRebates.com also uses “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow AskMrRebates.com to measure activity on the Site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences. Cookies are used by AskMrRebates.com to measure activity on the Site and to make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not.

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the Internet industry. AskMrRebates.com does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to AskMrRebates.com’s privacy policies. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do so.

#### Children and Privacy

AskMrRebates.com encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online, and to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children.

Individuals under 13

No information should be submitted to or posted on the Site by users under the age of 13 years without the consent of their parent or guardian. AskMrRebates.com does not provide any personally identifying information for users under the age of 13, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever unless disclosed during collection. Users under the age of 13 are generally asked not to participate in contests or other promotional opportunities.

Individuals 13 through 17

AskMrRebates.com requests that children under the age of 18 do not submit or post information to the Site without a parent or guardian’s consent. AskMrRebates.com may collect information, including personally identifying information, from users between the ages of 13 and 17, and with the permission of their parent or guardian this information may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by AskMrRebates.com and may be shared with third parties. If a user or their parent or guardian changes their mind with respect to such use, such user, parent or guardian may stop that use -- by e-mail request.

#### Links to Other Sites

It is important to note that AskMrRebates.com contains links to sites other than AskMrRebates.com, and that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as AskMrRebates.com. This can include links from advertisers, content providers and partners who may use AskMrRebates.com’s logo and or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you, and may collect data and make uses of it that AskMrRebates.com would not.

AskMrRebates.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time.
