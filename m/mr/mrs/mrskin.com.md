# Mr Skin's Privacy Policy

At MrSkin.com, a site operated by SK Intertainment, Inc./SK Europe BV, we are committed to protecting your privacy online. We are also committed to providing you with the very best experience we can on our website. In order to do so, we may gather certain personal information about you. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our website. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. 

### What information does MrSkin.com collect?

When you visit the MrSkin.com site, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes which pages are visited, types of products purchased, and any feedback from our visitors. We then aggregate this information with other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible.

When you become a member with us, you provide such personal information to us or one of our third-party processors:

  * First and last name
  * Billing address
  * Email address
  * Phone number
  * Credit card account number



In addition to the information we collect upon your initial subscription to Mr Skin, we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter promotions or contests, and when you respond to a survey.

### What do we do with the information we collect?

  1. It is used to fulfill and maintain your online subscription.
  2. Your phone number may be used in the event that our customer service representatives need to contact you and cannot reach you by email.
  3. Credit card information is used to bill you for your subscription. We use CurePay.com, Netbilling.com, CCBill.com, Paycom.net, VXSBill.com, OPSBilling.com, LocalBilling.com and 2000charge.net for these transactions. They are some of the largest and oldest e-commerce billing companies today with expertise in secure online transactions.
  4. The e-mail address members supply us with is never sold to any other website owner or merchant. We hate junk mail as much as you. This is why we will only send you e-mail about items that we feel you should know about. This includes special promotional items that Mr Skin personally endorses, membership changes, terms and conditions changes, Holiday cards, and the latest happenings on MrSkin.com. If you would like not to be notified by e-mail or would like to change your e-mail address, please send us a note with the [customer service form](https://web.archive.org/help/Contact-Mr-Skin) and let us know how we can best serve you. When we send you emails that include a link to the MrSkin.com site, that link may contain an alphanumeric identifier that allows us to identify the person to whom we sent the message so that we can personalize our content for that individual. If we ever send you emails concerning new products or services that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an email address by which you may opt out of receiving such emails.



### With whom do we share your information and for what purpose?

Mr Skin does not sell, rent, or trade any personally identifying information with others. However, when one or more of our business partners co-sponsor a service, promotion and/or contest, we may share some or all of the information collected in connection with such service, promotion or contest with the co-sponsor(s). If we intend to share such information, you will be notified prior to the collection of that information. If you do not want your information to be shared, you will be able to choose not to allow the transfer by not using or signing up for that particular service, promotion or contest.

### What information do parties other than Mr Skin collect?

In addition to our credit card processors, some advertisers or websites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you when you access or utilize those links. Mr Skin does not control the collection or use of such information, and the practices of those advertisers and websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

### What are cookies and how do we use them?

Our site may use cookies to speed navigation, keep track of items, and provide you with custom-tailored content. We also use cookies to remember information you gave us so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the site. By showing us how and when members and shoppers use the site, cookies also help us see which areas are popular and which are not. We also collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our sponsors and advertisers. Some advertisers or websites that have links on our site may also use their own cookies.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. You will not be able to log in, view clips or order from MrSkin.com if you turn off the cookies option.

### Credit card processing and security

Credit card security is an important aspect of the online experience. In order to keep your credit card information safe, your ordering information -- including your name, address, and credit card number -- is encrypted using a secure server, so that your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system.

Credit-card transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution or Gateway processor, which receives the credit card number and other personal identifying information only to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions. We also offer other payment options via our join page and as a last resort you can pay by certified check and send it by mail to us. Please contact Customer Support for how to proceed using certified checks.

### Cooperation with law enforcement

MrSkin.com fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to release information about members who we believe are in violation of applicable laws or regulations. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful.

### Security

MrSkin.com member accounts are secured by member-created passwords. MrSkin.com takes precautions to ensure that member account information is kept private. We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of our member information at any time.

If you are unsure whether this privacy policy is in conflict with the rules applicable where you are located, you should not submit your personal information to mrskin.com.

Users of mrskin.com located in countries outside of the United States who submit personal information do thereby consent to the transfer of that information to and/or storage of the information in the United States.

### Business transitions

In the event MrSkin.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
