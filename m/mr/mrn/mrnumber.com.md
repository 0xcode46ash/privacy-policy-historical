WhitePages, Inc. provides the Mr. Number website at [http://mrnumber.com](http://mrnumber.com/) (the “ ** _Site_** ”) and the Mr. Number mobile application (the “ ** _Mr. Number Mobile App_** ”) and maintains this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information we collect and receive from users of the Site and the Mr. Number Mobile App. This Privacy Policy applies only to information obtained by us from users of the Mr. Number Service.

This Privacy Policy may be modified and updated from time to time.  If we make material revisions to this Privacy Policy, we will use the date at the top to indicate the date it was last revised. The revised Privacy Policy will be effective immediately upon its being posted on this Web site or being made available through the Mr. Number Service. Your use of the Mr. Number Service following the posting of any such revisions will constitute your acceptance of any such revisions. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy each time you use the Mr. Number Service to make sure that you understand the applicable terms. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you must immediately terminate your use of the Mr. Number Service.

As used herein, the term “ ** _App User_** ” means any individual who installs the Mr. Number Mobile App on his or her mobile phone and the term “ ** _Site User_** ” means an individual who may not have the Mr. Number Mobile App downloaded to his or her phone but has submitted or modified his or her Caller ID Data (as defined below) to the Mr. Number Service so that information can be made available to App Users (App Users and Site Users, collectively, “ ** _Mr. Number Users_** ”).

**1.   Information – What We Collect and How We Use It**

**Why we collect information.**   We collect information from Mr. Number Users to provide useful products and services to you and others.  We also use this information to improve the quality of those products and services.

**What kinds of information we collect.   **We collect information that you provide to us or authorize us to collect as a result of using the Mr. Number Service ( _e.g.,_ your name and mobile phone number _,_ call and text logs, information in your mobile phone contacts, etc.).  Information we collect includes “ **Caller ID Data** ,” which is any information that you choose to submit to us to display in Mr. Number’s Caller ID results, including, but not limited to your name, phone number and other contact details.

We also collect technical information about your use of our products and services.  For example, when you visit the Site or interact with the Mr. Number Service, our servers automatically record certain information that your browser or mobile phone transmits so that we may keep track of which of our services you access. We do this in order to ensure that the elements of the Mr. Number Service are available to you and are customized for your use. During this process we may collect your IP address, unique user ID, mobile device type, date and time of your visits, location, pages viewed and browser details, as well as store cookies in your browser, all of which help us personalize and improve the Mr. Number Service. While you have the option to stop your browser from accepting Mr. Number cookies at any time, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use all portions of the Mr. Number Service or all of its functionality. For more information on how to stop accepting cookies, please refer to the help menu for your web browser.

**How we use your information.**   We use your information to provide and improve the Mr. Number Service, to help identify numbers associated with spammers, to provide customer support, and to respond to your inquiries. We may also use your information to verify public information and information obtained from other sources in our databases, and to help us improve our other products and services.

**With whom we share your information and why**.  Besides the consumer users of our products and services, we provide access to information to our business users ( _e.g._ , customer support centers, corporate fraud departments) so that they may identify and verify their customers. We provide access to information to third party partners of ours in order to provide our products and services to you. Further, we also provide access to non-personally-identifiable information to our third party advertisers so that they can deliver relevant online and mobile advertising to you (more information about third party advertising is provided below).

**Stop collection of your information by us**.  In order to stop further collection of information by us, you will need to stop using the Mr. Number Service.

**2.   Information that You Share**

Any Caller ID Data that you submit to the Mr. Number Service as well as any comments or submissions that you post to our corporate weblog, phone number complaint website, and support forums will be publicly available. Any information you choose to provide in a comment or a submission should reflect how much (or how little) you want other users to know about you.  We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage Mr. Number Users to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their comments or submissions.

**3.   Information Collected By Third Parties**

**What information third parties collect**. Third parties may collect information during your visits to our Site and use of the Mr. Number Mobile App.  Such information may include general information about you such as browser type, mobile device type, unique user ID, mobile carrier, IP address, date and time of your visits, locality, pages viewed.  Certain products and services may collect specific information such as your name, phone number, IP address, etc., but unless you provide specific details about yourself, information collected by such third parties will generally be limited to non-personally-identifiable information.

**How third parties collect your information.** Third parties may collect information by using cookies, web beacons, performance-measuring phone numbers, or GPS information. A cookie is a small file that contains a unique ID tag and stores information ( _e.g._ , pages visited, information voluntarily provided). A web beacon is a small graphic file used to identify if a page has been viewed. A performance measuring phone number involves collection of call-related information such as originating phone number and call duration. GPS information **** may include city, state and other information when you use our products or services on a GPS-enabled mobile device.

**Why third parties collect information**. _  _Third parties may collect information in order to (i) deliver relevant online and mobile advertising to you both on and off our sites; (ii) help us provide or analyze usage and effectiveness of our products and services; and (iii) for their own business purposes ( _e.g._ , such as to report aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about the use of their services and technologies).

**How third parties use the information they collect**.  Collection and use of data is subject to the privacy policies of those third party companies, such as the privacy policy of [AdMarvel](http://www.admarvel.com/AdMarvel_Privacy_Policy_2012.pdf) [http://www.admarvel.com/AdMarvel_Privacy_Policy_2012.pdf] or [Google](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) [http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/]. Accordingly, please review those policies for specific information.

**Third Party Advertising**.  As mentioned above, we may provide access to non-personally-identifiable information to our third party advertisers so that they can deliver relevant online and mobile advertising to you.  At this time, there is no industry-wide solution to opt out of receiving relevant mobile advertising, but to opt-out of Mr. Number’s tracking for the Mr. Number marketing program, [click here](https://www.optoutmobile.com/optOut) [https://www.optoutmobile.com/optOut].

For internet-based advertising, if applicable, we follow the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (about the collection and use of data for interest-based advertising) and expect third parties to comply with the disclosure and notification program specified by these principles. This means that third parties collecting and using this data are asked to provide a standard icon/link in or near their advertisements that will provide you with additional data about their privacy and advertising practices, as well as with the opportunity to directly opt-out of having your information collected.

**Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement**.  Mr. Number will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Mr. Number or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

**Business Transfers**.  Mr. Number may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Mobile Phone Data, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy.

**4.   Adding, Modifying or Removing Your Caller ID Information**

All Mr. Number Users may add and subsequently modify or remove their Caller ID Data from the Mr. Number Service at any time by going to <http://mrnumber.com/profile>. Removing your Caller ID Data means that your name will no longer appear to Mr. Number Users when you make a phone call to an App User.  Removing your Caller ID Data does not mean that your name and phone number will be deleted from our databases or from third party databases that may already have such information, but it does mean that your name will not appear in Mr. Number Caller ID results.

**5.   Our Policy Toward Children**

Our services are not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly publish information for anyone under the age of 13. If you know of anyone under the age of 13 whose information is published through the Mr. Number Service, or have other concerns about children’s privacy, please write to Mr. Number Privacy Manager, 1301 Fifth Ave, Suite 1600, Seattle, WA 98101 or contact [privacy@mrnumber.com](mailto:privacy@mrnumber.com). If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with information, we will delete such information from our files.

**6.   Miscellaneous**

**International Transfer**.  Your information may be transferred to – and maintained on – computers located outside of your state, province, country or other jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your area.  If you are located outside the United States and you choose to provide your information to us, the Mr. Number Service will transfer it to the United States and process it there.  By consenting to our Privacy Policy, and submitting information, you agree to that transfer.

**Links to Other Sites**.  Our Site may contain links to other websites.  While we do our best to link to reputable sites, the fact that we link to a website or present an ad is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites and we encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of other websites that you visit.

**Contacting Us**.  And of course, if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at [privacy@mrnumber.com](mailto:privacy@mrnumber.com).
