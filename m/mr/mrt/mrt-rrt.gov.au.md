##  Collection of information

###  Website visits

We do not collect personal information about you when you visit this website. When a person looks at our website, we make a record (in server logs) of information such as the network address, the pages accessed and documents downloaded and the type of browser used, for statistical and network management purposes. Some websites store information in 'cookies' on your computer. Our website does not do this.

###  Email addresses

The Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) will only record your email address if you send us an email message or otherwise provide us with your email address. It will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it and will not be added to a mailing list. Please note that when sending the tribunals emails, the contents may not be secure during transfer across the internet. Please contact the tribunals by telephone, facsimile or post if you have concerns about sending information by email.

###  During a review

The _Migration Act 1958_ (Cth) has particular provisions relating to the collection and use of personal information. These include: 

  * A requirement not to make a record of, or divulge or communicate, personal information other than for a purpose of the Migration Act, or for the purposes of, or in connection with, the performance of a function or duty or the exercise of a power under the Migration Act; and
  * A requirement not to publicly identify any applicant for a protection visa or any relative or other dependant of an applicant for a protection visa.



Any information provided to the tribunals during a review process by you or by other parties may be provided to other participants in proceedings, to other individuals or organisations when seeking expert opinion or assessment, and may become public during Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) proceedings or when an MRT decision is published.

The Migration Act requires that proceedings of the MRT be generally open to the public.

The Migration Act requires that all proceedings of the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) are held in private. Sometimes we collect personal information from a third party if you have consented or would reasonably expect us to collect the information in this way, for example from publicly available sources such as websites or telephone directories.

##  Publishing decisions

The Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) are required to publish decisions that are considered to be of 'particular interest'. The requirement to publish decisions is subject to certain restrictions:

  * For RRT decisions: The identity of the applicant and an applicant's relatives and dependants cannot be disclosed. Identifying features are removed from RRT decisions before they are published.
  * For MRT decisions: MRT decisions are published in full and include the applicant’s name, along with any other details recorded in the decision. In a minority of cases, a member may decide that publication of an MRT decision is to be restricted on public interest grounds. Where a relevant restriction applies, the decision is edited to remove the information which cannot be published.



Published decisions are available on the [Australasian Legal Information Institute's (AustLII's) website](http://www.austlii.edu.au/ "External link to Australian Legal Information Institute").  

##  Handling privacy breaches

The Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) have developed a guideline that outlines the procedures to be followed where a breach of the Privacy Act occurs.
