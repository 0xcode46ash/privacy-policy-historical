##  Part A — Personal information handling practices

As an Australian Government agency, we are bound by the [Australian Privacy Principles](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2014C00076/Html/Text#_Toc382303234) (

APPs

) in the Privacy Act which regulate how agencies may collect, use, disclose and store personal information, and how individuals may access and correct personal information held about them.

###  Collection

We collect personal information for purposes which are directly related to our functions or activities under the Migration Act and only when it is necessary for or directly related to such purposes. In providing personal/sensitive information to the tribunals you are taken to have given consent to the collection and use of that information for purposes under the Migration Act. The tribunals will collect personal/sensitive information about persons in connection with a review. The tribunals will not issue a separate privacy notice on each instance of collecting/using such information.

We also collect personal information related to employment services, human resource management, and other corporate service functions which are reasonably necessary for us to carry out our functions under the Migration Act and which are directly related to functions and activities under other Commonwealth legislation.

###  Use and disclosure of personal information

We use or disclose personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, namely for the purpose of conducting reviews.

  We may also use or disclose personal information generally:

  * for reasonably expected secondary purposes that are related or directly related to the primary purpose; or
  * for other purposes permitted by law; or
  * with the consent of the individual.



In certain circumstances we may provide information about applications for review to other government agencies or other entities. These include but are not limited to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the department), the Office of the MARA, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Australian Human Rights Commission, courts and tribunals and law enforcement agencies.

On occasions, we disclose personal information to overseas recipients during hearings when taking evidence from a witness who is overseas or in the course of an investigation undertaken by the department at the request of the tribunals. 

###  Accuracy and security of personal information held by us

We will endeavour to ensure that personal information sought and held by the tribunals is relevant, accurate, complete and up-to-date.

We use a range of physical and electronic security measures to protect personal information from misuse and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. These measures include, but are not limited to, restricted physical access to our offices, secure databases, computer-user identifiers and passwords.

###  Access to (and correction of) personal information held by us

You can access the personal information that we hold about you. We will provide access unless we consider that there is a sound reason under the Privacy Act, the _Freedom of Information Act 1982_ (the FOI Act) or any other relevant Acts including the Migration Act to withhold the information. You can also ask us to correct the personal information we hold about you under the FOI Act. If we refuse to give access to or to correct personal information held by us, we will provide you with written reasons for the refusal.   
For more information about how to request access to personal information and your available options, see the MRT-RRT web page ‘[Access to information](http://www.mrt-rrt.gov.au/About-Us/Access-to-information.aspx#Freedomofinformation)’.

  * A requirement not to publicly identify any applicant for a protection visa or any relative or other dependent of an applicant for a protection visa (section 431(2) of the Migration Act).Subject to certain exceptions, the tribunals must provide adverse information to an applicant for comment if the information would form the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review.  In some circumstances, this may be personal information of a third party who provided the adverse information or who is identified in the information (sections 359AA/359A and 424AA/424A).
