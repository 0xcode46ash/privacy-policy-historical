# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is of extreme importance to me. This privacy policy document outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected when you use my website. I never share and never sell personal information to third parties.

 **Log Files**  
As with most other websites, I collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files includes your IP address, the browser you used to visit my website, the time you visited my website and which pages you visited throughout my website. The information I collect is used to provide you a better service and is then discarded.

 **Cookies and Web Beacons**  
I may use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit my website. I use Google Analytics to analyse traffic on my website, and also use third party advertisements. Some of these advertisers may use technologies such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on my website, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit my website, and in some cases, whether you have Flash® installed or not. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes or showing certain ads based on specific websites you have visited. To learn more about how Google uses data when you use my website, visit [http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/).

 **DoubleClick DART Cookies**  
I also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your browser when you are browsing the web and visit a website using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests ("interest based targeting"). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history. For example, if you have been viewing websites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related website, such as one about sport. DART uses "non personally identifiable information". It does NOT track personal information about you. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all websites using this advertising by visiting [https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com](https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/). To learn more about this practice or the possibility of prohibiting the use of such data by such companies, visit [http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/). You should also consult the respective privacy policies of these third party ad servers for more detailed information on their practices as well as for instructions about how to opt-out of certain practices.

You can also chose to disable or selectively turn off my cookies or third party cookies in your browser settings. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with my website as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into your accounts. Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a website running advertisements, a new cookie will be added to your browser. If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your individual browser options. More detailed information about cookie management with specific web browsers can be found at their respective websites.
