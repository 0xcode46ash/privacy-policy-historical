**Our Commitment to Privacy**  
Your privacy is very important to us. Ginsburg Enterprises Incorporated (“GEI”) and its affiliates, owners of the MR. FOOD® and OOH IT’S SO GOOD!!® brands, respect your interest in maintaining your privacy. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices.

**The Information We Collect**  
This Policy applies to all information collected or submitted on mrfood.com. We do not collect personally identifiable information (i.e., information such as name, address, phone number, electronic mail [“e-mail”] address, etc., which might identify a user as a particular person) about you on our website or otherwise unless you choose to give it to us by making purchases from our website, entering a contest on our website, or by communicating with us by e-mail, telephone, postal mail or the like. When you choose to give us information, we endeavor to keep it confidential, but only to the extent described in this Privacy Policy.

You can visit the public parts of our website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information. We currently do not enable “cookies” on our website.

To improve the content and usability of this website, however, GEI does automatically collect information about the type of browser (for example, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.) used, the operating system resident on a user’s computer, and the date and time a user visited the site.

On some pages, you can order products. The types of personal information collected at these pages are: 

Name   
Address   
E-mail address   
Phone number   
Credit/Debit Card Information   
(etc.)

On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are: 

Name   
Address   
(etc.)

**How We Use Information**  
We may maintain some records of individuals who contact us in case we need to contact them later or provide them information in the future. If you choose to correspond with us through e-mail, we may retain the content of your e-mail messages, your e-mail address and our responses. We provide the same protection for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.  
We may post the name and hometown of contest winners on our website. By entering a contest on our website, you give us permission to so post your name and hometown should you be selected a winner. If you do not wish to receive such information, or have your name and hometown posted on the website if you should win a contest, please do not enter the contest or otherwise submit any personally identifiable information about yourself to us.

**Policy Terms**  
The terms of this Privacy Notice/Security Policy will supersede any inconsistent terms that you might seek to impose on any such Information, including terms accompanying any such Information, unless GEI expressly states otherwise in writing in connection with any specific request for Information that GEI may publish.

**Submission of Materials**  
Mr. Food and GEI are pleased to hear from loyal fans and welcome comments regarding their TV program, products and services, including the MR. FOOD® online services. Unfortunately, however, GEI’s company policy does not allow us to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions or materials other than those we may specifically request from time to time. We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by Mr. Food or GEI’s professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work.

**Shared Information**  
If you do submit any recipes, creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts or other information (collectively, the “Information”), the Information shall be deemed, and shall remain, the property of GEI. None of the Information shall be subject to any obligation of confidentiality on the part of Ginsburg Enterprises Incorporated, and GEI shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of Information. Without limitation of the foregoing, GEI shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to any Information submitted and will be entitled to use the Information for any commercial or other purpose whatsoever, without compensation to, or acknowledgement of, you or any other person sending the submission.

**Our Commitment to Data Security**  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

We take precautions, including use of sophisticated encryption and authentication tools, to protect the security of any personal information that you share with us. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our websites, and you do so at your own risk. 

**Ad Servers**  
In order to bring you offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads on our web pages. As a result of your visit to our site, ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information. For further information, consult the privacy policies of: https://www.valueclickmedia.com/privacy.shtml. 

**Our Commitment to Children's Privacy**  
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, applications on the mrfood.com website do not specifically solicit information from minors (anyone under eighteen years old) nor do they seek to determine whether the visitor is a minor. Minors are prohibited from entering any contest or otherwise providing personally identifiable information to GEI through the website. Because such information will not be specifically identified as being from minors, users of the mrfood.com website should be aware that personally identifiable information submitted to it by minors will be subject to being treated in the same manner as information given by an adult.

**E-Commerce**  
We sell merchandise through the site located on the World Wide Web at [mrfood.com](http://www.%20mrfood.com/). Because we recognize and respect your privacy, we limit the information collected about you to what is needed for conducting business and offering products or services that might be of interest to you. As well, we limit our employees’ access to our customer files only to those who need such information to conduct our business.

**Product Descriptions**  
GEI attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, GEI does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of this site is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by GEI itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.

**Privacy Policy Changes/Changes to Your Information**   
If we decide to change or update our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here in the Privacy Policy section of our website. If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or would like to review, correct or remove any information that we may have on file about you, please feel free to contact us by e-mail at [info@mrfood.com](mailto:info@mrfood.com).

The compilation of all content on this site is the exclusive property of GEI and protected by U.S. copyright laws.
