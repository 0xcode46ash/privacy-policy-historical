What information do we collect and do we use it?  
mufin collects information on our users in three ways: by voluntary submission through opt-in email and/or surveys and registrations; sweepstakes and/or contest entries; and through the use of cookies.  
The information mufin collects is used in a variety of ways: for internal review; to improve the content of the site, thus making your user experience more valuable; and to notify customers about updates to the service and products. In connection with the use of our newsletter, we are collecting data on whether you have opened it, which information you use from it, and which information you do not find interesting. This will enable us to fine-tune our future offers according to your wishes. From time to time we may share this information with other reputable organizations for marketing purposes or the information is used by mufin to contact consumers for its own marketing endeavours. As a valued consumer, we offer you the opportunity to "opt in", or agree, to accept these marketing opportunities.
