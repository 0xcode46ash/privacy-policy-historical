The University collects and stores web usage information and system logs. These records may contain personally identifiable information (e.g. IP addresses) and are used to manage capacity, performance and security, and to help maintain and improve services. Logged information is not shared with, or disclosed to, any third party except as explicitly approved by the website user or as required by law.

This website may also deposit small text files called cookies on your computer. The University uses cookies only to enhance or customize your visit. Users may choose not to allow cookies to be stored on their computers. However, some information may not display properly, and some services may not be available as a result.

Some services (e.g. bulletin boards, web mail) by their nature distribute communications or information that you provide. Information you share via these services may be collected, stored and disseminated by others.
