# Municipal Code Corporation - Privacy Policy

#### Introduction

Municipal Code Corporation (MCC) respects each individual's right to personal privacy. We will collect and use information through our website only in the ways disclosed in this statement. This statement applies solely to information collected at MCC's website.

While the majority of access to information provided on the Municode website is offered free of charge, we do charge fees for select premium products and services. Two products for which we charge a fee are Multiple Code Search subscriptions, and printed codes and update subscriptions sold through our online store. To enable the purchase of these products MCC collects billing and credit card information. The credit card information is not archived. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction.
