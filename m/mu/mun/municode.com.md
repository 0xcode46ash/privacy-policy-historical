The initial product for which a fee is charged is Multiple Code Searching, which enables subscribers to query more than one Code simultaneously. To enable the purchase of these products Municipal Code Corporation collects billing and credit card information. The credit card information is not archived. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction.
