## Privacy and Data Policy for Mugasha

Mugasha respects and values the privacy of our visitors and members. This privacy policy covers how Mugasha treats personal information collected and received.

**Last updated: September 26, 2008**

  1. **What This Privacy Policy Covers**  
This policy covers personal information including personally identifiable information about you like your name or email address. This Privacy Statement does not apply to the use of your Personal Information by third parties that Mugasha does not own or control, or to individuals that Mugasha does not control or manage. Note also that children under 13 are not permitted to use Mugasha. Therefore, Mugasha's privacy policy does not account for children's use of the site.
  2. **Links to Other Sites**  
Mugasha contains links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by Mugasha. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of such other sites. 
  3. **Information Collection, Data Ownership and Use**  
Registered users of Mugasha own their personal information and data created as a result of using Mugasha.com. Mugasha.com will retain a non-exclusive license for the duration of time the user maintains data at Mugasha. In addition, for the duration of time users maintain data at Mugasha, they grant all users a commercial, non-exclusive reuse license to their publicly accessible data, created through the use of Mugasha, unless they choose options to limit the public distribution of their public data, such as "subscriptions", �??favorites�?�, or "playlists". This data may be accessible by default via RSS feeds or search, as well as through other methods of public collection.

Mugasha will not share or sell your personal information, such as email addresses, to anyone without your authorization or consent, with the exception of those terms disclosed in this Privacy Statement. Users of Mugasha can request at any time that their personal or public data be removed, and to the fullest extent possible, a user's data will be removed from the Mugasha system. Exceptions might include data that has been depersonalized and aggregated (see following paragraph) or data that is contained in backup systems.

Mugasha will aggregate information about users of the site. "Aggregated Information" means information where personally identifying information is removed, and lots of visitor's and member's data is aggregated together to become statistical information for Mugasha about how the site is used. Aggregated information that is not personally identifying for users is solely owned by Mugasha and is used to improve our services. Statistical information may be shared with other parties.

  4. **Surveys or Contests**  
Mugasha may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you decide to participate, we will request certain Personal Information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice about whether or not to disclose your information. The requested information may include contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code).

This information will only be used internally to determine eligibility, notify contest winners, and to measure the success of our efforts. Publicly held contest winners may be labeled on the Mugasha site in public ways through their usernames, ID's, aliases, or other representations.

  5. **General Information**  
Mugasha collects personal information upon registration. When you register we ask for your email address and certain optional information such as your name, birth date, gender, biographical information, instant message user names, personal websites and personal interests. Mugasha automatically collects and records information from your browser, including your IP address, cookie, and the page you request. IP Addresses are disclosed by your browser as you view a web page. Your IP address may also stored when you register with Mugasha.
  6. **Cookies**  
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. 
    * You might configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.
    * Rejecting all cookies means you will not be able to use Mugasha products or services requiring you to "sign in."
    * Mugasha uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including: 
      * Accessing your information when you "sign in".
      * Preference tracking while you are using Mugasha's services.
      * Displaying the most appropriate advertising, based on your interests and activity on Mugasha.
      * Estimating and reporting our total audience size and traffic.
      * Conducting research to improve Mugasha's content and services.
    * Other advertising companies may set and access their cookies on your computer. They are subject to their own privacy policies, not the Mugasha policy. 
    * Advertisers or other entities do not have access to Mugasha cookies.
  7. **Third Party Advertisers**  
Advertisements appearing on Mugasha may be delivered by a third party. For information about advertisers on Mugasha, please visit their websites through links provided at the advertisements on Mugasha.
  8. **Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
Mugasha allows many activities for members that will result in revealing some information about your activities to others, including visitors and members. For example, these activities might include posting a comment, making a playlist, favoriting music, or sending a message. When you "write" something in Mugasha, your Mugasha username, ID, or alias that you are posting under will be visible to other users. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Mugasha is not responsible for the messages you post or receive, either publicly or through the Mugasha messaging system.

Generally, Mugasha will not share your personal information with other people or nonaffiliated companies without your consent except to provide products or services you've requested and in the following circumstances: 

    * Mugasha may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas, warrants, court orders or legal process or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
    * It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Mugasha's terms of use, or as otherwise permitted or required by law.
    * We will transfer information about you if Mugasha is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Mugasha will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Mugasha web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
    * Mugasha may share demographic information with business partners. No personally identifiable information will ever be used without your permission.  

  9. **Choice/Opt-out**  
At any time, you can change your Mugasha account information. You can delete your Mugasha account from your account page or by emailing [support@mugasha.com](mailto:support@mugasha.com) (subject line: "Account Termination Request"). If you request deletion through email, Mugasha will delete your information within 14 days. However, please note that some personal information may need to be maintained if it is for billing or required by law. Some employees will have access to our personal information, but this will be limited to those whose jobs are dependent on such information.
  10. **Changes in this Privacy Policy**  
This Privacy Statement is a living document. Mugasha may update this policy at any time for any reason. If we significantly change how we handle personal information, we will notify the primary email address specified in your Mugasha account. We will also place a notice on our blog and on the Privacy page at mugasha.com/privacy.
