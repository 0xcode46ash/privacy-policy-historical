For each visitor to our Web site ("User"), our Web server will automatically recognize the User's domain name, but not the User's e-mail address. Mutual collects and stores the domain name, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, the aggregate information on the Web pages that Users access or visit, and any and all information volunteered by the User, such as survey information and/or information we seek for site registration or security purposes. The User information collected by Mutual will not be shared with organizations which are not affiliated with Mutual unless otherwise noted below. 

Users who supply us with their postal address, e-mail address or telephone numbers on-line can expect Mutual to share that information with Mutual's affiliates, its agents or brokers. As such, these Users may receive periodic mailings from Mutual, its affiliates, its agents or brokers with information regarding new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please indicate it in your on-line communication and Mutual will remove your name from the list it shares with its affiliates, its agents or brokers. 

Mutual places Internet cookies on our Users' hard drives. A cookie is a small text file that is sent from Mutual's Web server to a Users' personal computer. This file contains information about a User's visit to Mutual's Web site that only Mutual's server can read. The cookies are stored on the User's hard drive and are not stored, in any form, by Mutual. Cookies are used throughout the log-in session to enhance a User's return visit to Mutual's Web site. They are also used, when applicable, to verify the User's authorization to access certain Mutual Web pages (e.g., a broker's access to the "Mutual e-net") so that the Users are not required to enter a user name and password every time they access a different page. Cookies may also provide a record of a User's visit, including information such as their User ID, password, time of last visit, and Web pages viewed. Except for cookies that are used to verify secured access authorization to various secured Mutual Web pages, the cookies that Mutual will issue to casual Users will not contain user ID and passwords or information used in tracking. Users may decline the cookies by using the appropriate feature of their Web browser software, but by doing so, may experience a decrease in functionality.
