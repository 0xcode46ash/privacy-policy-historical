Throughout this Website Privacy Statement, reference to your 'personal information' means information which identifies you as an individual, or from which your identity can be reasonably ascertained. Your home address, home telephone number and e-mail address are examples of personal information.

Any changes to this Website Privacy Statement will be posted on Museum Victoria’s website. We encourage you to review this Statement from time to time.

Museum Victoria is committed to protecting your personal privacy. The principles that guide Museum Victoria in relation to collecting, handling and storing your personal information can be found in our [Privacy Policy](http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/pdf/MV_Privacy_Policy_2005.pdf).

The following information pertains to your privacy and Museum Victoria’s website.

**Internet Security**

There are risks associated with transmitting information over the internet. We use a number of mechanisms to protect the security and integrity of your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as completely secure. While we strive to protect such information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, therefore you do so at your own risk.

**Data Security**

Once any personal information comes into our possession, we will take reasonable steps to protect that information from misuse and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Museum Victoria provides secure information storage systems and procedures for the management of both physical and electronic information. Information will be disposed of in accordance with approved disposal schedules under the Public Records Act 1973.

**Linking to other Websites**

Museum Victoria websites may, from time to time, contain links to the websites of other organisations which may be of interest to you. Linked websites are responsible for their own privacy practices and you should check those websites for their respective privacy statements.

**Web Measurement Service used by Museum Victoria**

In common with many websites we may also collect information which tells us about visitors to the Museum Victoria website. For example, we may collect information about the date, time and duration of visits, and which pages of the Museum Victoria website are most commonly accessed. This information is not linked to the identity of visitors.

**Cookies**

As part of the service provided by our web monitoring service provider, Nielsen//NetRatings, Museum Victoria uses third party cookies, left on your machine by Nielsen//NetRatings, to provide us with information to assist in making our website more useable.

Cookies are small text files with a unique identifier that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser, enabling NetRatings’ systems to recognise your preferences and settings. The cookies collect information such as the number of visits, unique visits, documents viewed, browser type, how the site is navigated, the sections of the website visited and other website usage information. In using these cookies, none of your personal information is retrieved or recorded by Museum Victoria.

**Web Beacons**

The Nielsen//NetRatings service also uses web beacons (a piece of code sometimes referred to as a '1x1 clear pixel', or 'clear GIF'). This technology gathers more detailed website usage information, which assists in improving our website. The resulting information does not personally identify you.

**Clickstream Data**

Clickstream data is gathered by the Nielsen//NetRatings service. This data is information about the path that a user takes while using the website, and is used to make the website more useable. The resulting information provided to Museum Victoria (e.g. the most common path through the website) does not identify individual users.
