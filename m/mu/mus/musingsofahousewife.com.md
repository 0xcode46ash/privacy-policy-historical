MOAH will use the personally identifiable information that it collects about you to contact you in response to consumer-initiated inquiries, to provide the services to you that you request, to alert you to changes in services or features, to provide newsletters and/or announcements and to provide you with requested information regarding MOAH.

MOAH may direct you to third party websites.  Those websites are not affiliated with MOAH and their privacy policies may differ from MOAH’s privacy policy.  MOAH is in no way responsible for the privacy policies or treatment of information from third party websites and strongly encourages you to review the privacy policies of every website you visit to determine what information they collect and how such information is handled by that website.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website.

We are serious about the security of your personal information.  We limit access to your personally identifiable information to those individuals (i.e., our employees and agents) who we reasonably believe need to have access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.

Your personally identifiable information is stored on our servers located in the United States.
