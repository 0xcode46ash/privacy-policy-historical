**Privacy Policy**

Resonance Pte Ltd (“Resonance”) has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm and continuing commitment to the privacy of personal information provided by those visiting and interacting with Resonance. We hold the privacy of your personal information in the highest regard. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.

| 1 |  WEBSITE USAGE INFORMATION  
---|---  
| We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. However, we do not use cookies nor do we link your IP address to any personally identifiable information. We use tracking information to determine which areas our site users visit based on traffic to those areas. Resonance does not track what individual users read, but rather how often each page is visited. This helps us maintain a superior and informative website for you.  
2 |  THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT  
| Our registration forms require users to give us contact information that may include name, email address, format preference (HTML vs. Text), address, and facts about your company size, database type, and similar information. We do not request sensitive information from our visitors, such as credit card or social security numbers. We use customer contact information from the registration forms to send the user requested information about our company. We never sell, share or trade any of our customer information with other companies that are not certified Resonance partners or VARs. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of twelve.  
3 |  LINKS  
| This site contains links to other sites. Resonance is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of these sites and determine if that site protects your privacy in a responsible manner and to your satisfaction.  
4 |  SECURITY TECHNOLOGY  
| Resonance has made a substantial investment in the latest server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect our information assets. These technologies are deployed as part of sophisticated security architecture. All data resides in a tightly controlled, secure data center.   
| These investments mean that information about the identity and preferences of individual members is never accessible to anyone outside Resonance. We will maintain safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your personally identifiable information.  
5 |  EMAIL MARKETING NEWSLETTER   
| When you subscribe to the Resonance’s Constant CustomerTM Newsletter, we will use the email address and format preference you provide to send you updates on email marketing's best practices, notification of email marketing events, and strategies to make your next email marketing campaign a success.  
6 |  SURVEYS  
| We may conduct occasional online surveys via our website or via an email newsletter. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate. Participating in an online survey does not automatically add your name to the subscriber list for the Resonance’s Constant CustomerTM Newsletter or News.  
7 |  CHOICE/OPT-IN/OPT-OUT  
| This site allows users to email us to remove their information from our database so that they will not receive future communications or to no longer receive our service. We provide you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us easily and promptly. Our unsubscribe requests are processed immediately. Users can also correct, update or access their information by emailing us at marketing@resonance.com.sg.  
8 |  ACQUISITION OR CHANGES IN OWNERSHIP OF RESONANCE PTE LTD  
| In the event that Resonance Pte Ltd (or a substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, customer information would be considered part of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are transferred.  
9 |  POLICY MODIFICATIONS  
| We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If and when Resonance makes changes to this privacy policy statement, we will highlight the changes on our homepage and email users who have given us permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.
