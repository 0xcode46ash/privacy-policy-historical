In some cases, we will direct you to a third party partner site which will collect this information from you and fulfill your order.

 **Information you provide upon entering a promotion or competition:**  if you enter a promotion or competition you will need to provide certain personal information which will be used in accordance with the terms of the promotion or competition.

The data collected through cookies, web analytics and web logs may be transferred to third parties. For more information on how this website uses cookies, see our cookie policy.

 **Email communications:**  we use web beacons in our emails to track the success of our marketing campaigns. If you open an email from us, we can see which of the pages of our website you visited. Our web beacons don’t store any information on your computer but, by communicating with our cookies on your computer, they can tell us when you have opened an email from us.
