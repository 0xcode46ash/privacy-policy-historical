### **Data Collection with Econda**

In order to better meet our customer’s demands and to optimize this website, anonymised data is collected and stored using solutions and technologies offered by Econda GmbH (http://www.econda.de/), as well as the generation of user profiles using pseudonyms. For this purpose, cookies can be used which enable the recognition of your internet browser. However, user profiles are not combined with the pseudonym data without the explicit consent of the visitor. In particular, IP addresses are made unrecognizable immediately after receipt, which makes it impossible to assign user profiles to IP addresses. Visitors to this website may object to this data collection and storage at any time.
