  | **secure shopping ::**

**musicnotes.com** is designed to provide a safe and secure shopping environment. When you access account information or place orders, our systems work with the browser software on your computer to establish a secure, encrypted connection using an Internet-standard technology called SSL. This encrypted connection prevents information from being intercepted as it travels the Internet between our systems. AOL, Internet Explorer, and Netscape all use SSL to protect transactions. You can verify that you are viewing a secure web page by checking your browser's lock icon — on a secure page the lock will appear in the "locked" position.

Your credit card information is immediately sent through a secure connection to our credit card processor and is never permanently retained on our computers. If for any reason these systems fail and unauthorized charges are made to your account, the Fair Credit Billing Act stipulates that your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. This protection applies only to credit cards (not debit cards) issued under the laws of the United States of America. Credit cards issued in other countries may afford similar protection.

**privacy policy ::**

We are strongly committed to protecting your privacy. The information we collect about you is used to process orders and personalize your shopping experience. When you order from **musicnotes.com** , we need your name, address, e-mail address, credit card number, and credit card expiration date in order to charge for and deliver your selections. Your credit card information is encrypted during processing and is not stored permanently on our computers. All customer information is stored on systems protected against unauthorized access.

**musicnotes.com** does not rent, trade, or sell the personal information you give us. We may provide aggregate statistics about our sales, website traffic patterns, and site visitors to reputable third parties, but this data cannot be identified with any specific individual. In special circumstances, **musicnotes.com** may release personal information to law enforcement agencies if necessary to comply with the law or protect the rights, property, and safety of **musicnotes.com** , our users, or others.
