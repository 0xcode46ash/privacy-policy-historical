PRIVACY POLICY

last updated June 2015

This Privacy Policy describes how we at musical.ly, Inc. and Shanghai WeShare Technology Co. Ltd (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us”), handle your information in connection with your use and operation of[ ](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.musical.ly/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNE7fv4lDmvY9XAZisuqP4jb4oZhmg)[www.musical.ly](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.musical.ly/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNE7fv4lDmvY9XAZisuqP4jb4oZhmg), its related webpages, and/or any and all applications (apps) or other software owned or operated by the Company (collectively, the “Platform”). This Privacy Policy describes the kind of information we gather and how it is used, and how you can review and request changes to any of your personal information. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Platform and not to information collected offline.

1\. Information You Provide

Some of our services require you to provide personal information, specifically your name, username, password, and email address. We may also collect your photograph, video, Facebook ID and Twitter ID (if you sign up using these services), other third-party login identifications, geographical information (such as through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals), and any biographical details that you provide. This can include information about the content you provide, such as its location or date of creation. We collect contact information that you upload, sync or import (such as an address book) from a device. We collect information about the people and groups you are connected to and how you interact with them, such as the groups you like to share with and the people you communicate with the most.

If you use the Platform for purchases or financial transactions, we collect information about the purchase or transaction. This includes your payment information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card information, and other account and authentication information, as well as billing, shipping and contact details.

You may always review and make changes to your personal information by emailing your request to info@musical.ly. Additionally, you can refuse to supply personal information, but doing so may prevent you from engaging in certain Platform activities or features.

2\. Information We Receive About You

Like most online service operators, we may collect information about your use of the Platform. The amount and type of information we gather depends on the nature of your interaction with the Platform. The types of information we may collect are your Internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, language preference, time zone setting, device locations, operating system, platform, Platform page(s) viewed, access date and time, time spent on the Platform or a Platform page, and cookie data (see below). We also collect information that other people provide when they use the Platform, including information about you, such as when they share a video of you, send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact information.

We may receive information about you and your activities on and off the Platform from third-party partners, such as information from a partner when we jointly offer services or from an advertiser about your experiences or interactions with them.

3\. Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website or app stores on a visitor’s computer or mobile device, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website/app each time the visitor returns. We may use cookies to help us authenticate users, track usage of our websites, and remember users access preferences and location (for purposes of provide correct resource URLs). The Platform uses “Permanent cookies,” which are cookies that are stored on the user's computer or mobile device and that are not deleted when the browser is closed. Permanent cookies can retain user preferences for a particular website, allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions. Permanent cookies can be used to identify individual users, and can be used by websites to analyze users’ behavior within the website. These cookies can also be used to provide information about the aggregate number of visitors to a website, the average time spent on a particular page, and generally the performance of the website. They are usually configured to keep track of users for a prolonged period of time, in some cases many years into the future.

Platform visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computer or mobile device should set their browser to refuse cookies before using the Platform, with the drawback that certain features of the Platform may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

4\. How We Use Information We Collect

We use the information we collect, including personal information and non-personal information, to: (i) operate, maintain, and improve the Platform, our products, or our services; (ii) deliver products or services that users request or ask for; (iii) provide customer support; (iv) respond to comments and questions or contact users at their request; (v) inform users about promotions, events, and news related to products, services, and features; (vi) show and measure the effectiveness of advertisements; (vii) process and deliver contest entries and rewards; (viii) keep internal records; and (ix) investigate, deter, and protect against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity. We may store or process your information on servers located outside of your home country; by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer of such information to such servers.

You may opt out of receiving promotional, event, news, and/or marketing communications at any time by emailing your opt-out request to:[info@musical.ly](mailto:info@musical.ly).

5\. Information We Share

We may transfer and disclose your personal information to our vendors, contractors, service providers, and affiliated organizations to support the Platform and our business, as long as they have agreed to abide by the confidentiality obligations in this Privacy Policy. We may also disclose your information, including personal information and non-personal information, in certain other circumstances, as described below.

We may share your personal information with third parties or the public at your request, such as when you choose to share videos with your friends or tag the videos on Instagram. We may use all of the information we have about you to show you relevant advertisements. We do not share information that personally identifies you with advertising, measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission.

If we believe in good faith that disclosure of your personal information is (i) legally required in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request, and/or (ii) legally required or reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, including intellectual property, or those of third parties or the public at large, we may disclose the information.

If the Company (or either one of them) is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, or in the event that the Company (or either one of them) goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information may be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. By using the Platform, you acknowledge and agree that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of the Company (or either one of them) may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

6\. Protecting Your Information

We take reasonable measures to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of personal information through encryption, passwords, physical security, etc. However, it remains possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications and may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Platform. Although we work hard to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

7\. California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice

Under California law, commercial website and online service operators are required to disclose how they respond to web browser “Do Not Track” signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about their online activities over time and across third party websites, to the extent the operator engages in that collection. At this time, we track our customers’ personal information over time and across third-party websites. However, we do not currently interpret, respond to, or alter our practices when we receive Do Not Track signals. Please note that third parties may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you visit the Platform or other online websites and services. To find out more about Do Not Track, you may wish to visit[ ](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.allaboutdnt.com/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNEKBGfgvRkCMTGFvYvPRYToAmj8vA)[http://www.allaboutdnt.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.allaboutdnt.com/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNEKBGfgvRkCMTGFvYvPRYToAmj8vA).

8\. CALIFORNIA “ERASER LAW” NOTICE

Registered users of the Platform who are California residents and are under 18 years of age may request and obtain removal of postings on the Platform that they themselves posted by emailing us at[ ](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://musical.ly/C:/Users/mwhitaker/AppData/Local/Litera/Temp/info@musical.ly&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNGl8tdO3-XqO6GD87EK02P2dkRsjQ)[info@musical.ly](mailto:info@musical.ly). All requests must be labeled “California Removal Request” on the email subject line. All requests must provide a description of the content or information in your Posting that you want removed and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material and, so that we can process your request and contact you if we have questions, include your name and the name and URL (if applicable) of the website, application or other interactive service. We shall not accept requests via postal mail, telephone, or facsimile. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or may not be able to respond if you do not provide complete information.

Please also note that any requests for removal do not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information from the Platform. For example, content that you have posted may be republished or reposted by another user or third party.

9\. International Users

If you access the Platform from a location outside the United States, you may be subject to laws governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States law. For example, The European Union Directive on Data Protection (the “E.U. Directive”) generally prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union that fail to ensure an “adequate level of [privacy] protection.” “Personal data” under the E.U. Directive means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An “identifiable person” is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. Therefore “personal data” includes information that you may transmit to the Platform. We do not currently guarantee compliance with the E.U. Directive or the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries. We have not certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. By using the Platform, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to the United States, and to utilize services and applications whose use are governed by the laws and jurisdiction of the United States, notwithstanding the requirements of any other jurisdiction, including, without limitation, the E.U. Directive.

10\. Privacy Policy Changes

We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time, and in our sole discretion. The most recent version of our Privacy Policy will always be posted on this page and accessible via our homepage at[ ](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.musical.ly/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNE7fv4lDmvY9XAZisuqP4jb4oZhmg)[www.musical.ly](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.musical.ly/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNE7fv4lDmvY9XAZisuqP4jb4oZhmg). We encourage you to regularly check this page for any changes to our Privacy Policy.
