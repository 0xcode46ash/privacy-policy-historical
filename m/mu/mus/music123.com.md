### **Music123's Consumer Privacy Pledge**

Your privacy is important to us! Music123 is committed to protecting the privacy of its customers and visitors, and safeguarding their information. Music123 will not share any personally identifiable information with anyone for any reason without your explicit permission. 

Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings. 

## **How We Use Your Information**

When ordering, a customer needs to create a personal account. Through this account, the user is providing certain types of information such as physical address, telephone number, email address, credit card number and expiration date. Without this information, an order cannot be shipped and/or billed. An email may be sent, or a phone call made if there is any trouble processing an order.

Personal demographic data, such as age, gender, and income are optional; they are not required to browse the site, create an account, or to order from Music123. This information is stored and viewed collectively with all such user information. The data allows Music123 to better understand its customers, and thus provide better service and more appropriate product offerings.

Music123 may at times share aggregated demographic information with partners and advertisers. This data is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

Music123 uses various shipping companies to deliver your orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for those goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store nor use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

This site may at times make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and caution should be exercised when deciding to disclose personal information. 

Music123 will not sell, share, nor rent this information to any third party marketer without your express knowledge and consent in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets.

At that time, information may be shared with the parent, subsidiary or merger partner involved in the transaction. Music123 also reserves the right to sell its interest in membership information as a separate asset of the corporation in the event of a major restructuring or similar corporate event.

#### **Correcting & Updating Your Information**

If there is a change to be made to a user's personally identifiable information - such as a zip code, email address, or area code changes - such editing may be done by the registrant by accessing the relevant account and clicking on Edit Your Account. 

## **Opting-Out**

Music123.com users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having information used for purposes not directly related to this site at the point where the information is asked. Users who no longer wish to receive the Music123 newsletter or promotional materials from Music123 partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the specific directions included in every email message. 

## **Newsletter Registration**

In addition to special announcements and offers exclusive to email recipients, the newsletter allows a recipient to edit account information, change the type of announcements and offers received, and change the format of the message (from text only to text and graphics). Each message also allows the recipient to immediately unsubscribe from future email messages. At the time of email newsletter registration, the recipient is asked whether he/she would like to receive special email offers from Music123-approved partners. This option may always be edited at the newsletter sign-up page.

**Surveys & Contests**  
From time-to-time this site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information. Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

## **Security**

Music123 takes every precaution to protect the information and privacy of users. When users submit sensitive information via the website, the information is protected both online and off-line. When sensitive information such as a credit card number is required, that information is transmitted with the most advanced encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as the order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. All user information is protected offline as well, in Music123's restricted offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing specialist or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers on which information is stored are kept in a secure and closely monitored environment, behind a locked cage.

## **Log Files**

For each visitor to a site owned or operated by Music123, the web server automatically recognizes and collects, where possible, the visitor's domain name/IP address, pages visited, length of visit, and other general usage data. This information is not linked to personally identifiable information. It is collected and stored with the same information from all visitors as one large log file. This log file is then used to determine general site usage patterns and to analyze trends so that a more useful, streamlined experience may be provided for visitors.

## **Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing certain habitual information about the user. Cookies allow Music123 to optimize the user's experience on the site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on this site. Once the user closes thier browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on this site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on this site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use this site. However, the user may be limited in some areas of the site. 

## **Children**

Music123 does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults as a small percentage of our business. If you are under 13, you may use Music123 only with express permission of a parent or guardian. Children under 13 may not register on the site without the express written consent of a parent or guardian. 

## **When Leaving This Site**

This web site contains links to other, non-affiliated sites. Please be aware that Music123 is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. Users are encouraged to be aware when they leave this site, and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.

**Take Privacy Seriously**  
We believe our Policy provides you with the safest shopping experience possible. Since offerings and technologies change, we reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of our Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. If policy changes are substantial, we will do our best to notify users.

If you have any questions about the security of any Music123 website, or your privacy, you may send email to [privacy@music123.com](mailto:privacy@music123.com).
