# MusicStack - Privacy Policy

**PRIVACY**  
We are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers and using your information responsibly. 

**HOW WE DO NOT USE YOUR INFORMATION**  
Our site uses an order and registration form so you can request products or information. Contact information (email address, telephone number, address, etc.) from the order form will NEVER be sold, rented, traded or given away. We respect your privacy. The information you provide to us is STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL. 

**HOW WE USE THIS INFORMATION**  
Contact information (email address, telephone number, address, etc.) from the order form is used to get in touch with you when necessary to keep you up to date with your order(s) and for receiving our e-newsletter which you can opt-out of at anytime. Any financial information (credit card numbers, credit card expiration dates, billing address, etc.) that is collected is used to bill you for products and services and is only viewable by the seller(s) that you order from. 

**COOKIES, WEB BEACONS & IP ADDRESS TRACKING**  
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums. 

We also use third party advertisements on MusicStack to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). 

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts. 

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address also may be used to gather broad demographic information and to recognize customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information aids us in merchandising and in developing the design and layout of the site. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser. They make it possible for us to recognize your browser when you visit. By doing this, we can personalize your return visits and save you time during checkout. In order to enjoy the benefits of being a registered user, your browser must be set to accept cookies. We may also collect and share information about the pages that you visit on our site, but this information is not personally identifiable 

**HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS STORED**  
This site uses a secure 256-bit server (SSL) to encrypt your personal information. We use strong security measures to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of your information once it is in our records. This includes storing your credit card information encrypted on our servers.
