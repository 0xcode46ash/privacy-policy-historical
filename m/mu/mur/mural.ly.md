# Privacy Policy - MURAL

Effective: April 12, 2017

You can see the past version of our Privacy Policy in our [Policy Archive](https://web.archive.org/terms/archive/privacy-policy-2014-06-24/).

## Introduction

Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect at MURAL, how MURAL uses it, and what choices you have.

When we talk about “MURAL,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this policy, we are referring to Tactivos, Inc., the company which provides the Services. This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of MURAL in connection with our online services ("Services"), which are made available to you through our website located at mural.co (the "Site").

When we talk about the “Services” in this policy, we are referring to our online workplace collaboration tools and platform. Our Services are currently available for use via a web browser or applications specific to your desktop or mobile device, as further described in our [ Help Center](https://support.mural.ly/hc/en-us).

This Privacy Policy applies to visitors to the Site, who view only publicly- available content (the “Visitors”) and subscribers who have signed up to access and use our Services (“Subscribers”).

By visiting our Site, Visitors are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Service. By signing up, accessing and/or using our Services, each Subscriber is agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Service.

Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Service

## Information we collect

When you sign up to use the Services, either as an individual or on behalf of a company, you may be asked to provide us with the following information: your first name, last name, email address, and company name (if applicable).

You may choose to sign-in using your Google, or your company identity provider account (“Third Party IdP”). By signing-in using your Third Party IdP, you are authorizing MURAL to collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, any and all information that you have authorized the Third Party IdP to provide to us. Such information may include your first and last name, unique identifier, e-mail address and picture.

We will collect billing and payment information which may include your credit card number, billing address, and other payment related information (“Billing Information”). Billing Information is collected and processed by our third-party payment processor operating as our agent (See, Onward Transfers to Third Parties). MURAL does not directly obtain or process any Billing Information.

## Our Cookie policy

MURAL uses cookies and similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons, to record log data. We use both session-based and persistent cookies.

Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer and from your computer or mobile device to us each time you visit our website or use our desktop application. They are unique to your account or your browser. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.

Some cookies are associated with your account and personal information in order to remember that you are logged in and which workspaces you are logged into. Other cookies are not tied to your account but are unique and allow us to carry out site analytics and customization, among other similar things. If you access the Services through your browser, you can manage your cookie settings there but if you disable some or all cookies you may not be able to use the Services.

MURAL sets and accesses our own cookies on the domains operated by MURAL and its corporate affiliates. In addition, we use third party tools for website analytics. We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.

We will retain your personal information in a form that identifies you only for as long as it serves the purpose(s) for which it was initially collected as stated in this Privacy Policy, or subsequently authorized.

## Important Notice for Residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland

[MURAL complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt00000004F4RAAU&status=Active) as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. MURAL has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, Recourse, Enforcement and Liability, and the Supplemental Principles (the “Privacy Shield Principles”). If there is a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. We are committed to applying the Privacy Shield Principles to all personal information received from the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway (referred to herein as the “EU”) and Switzerland in reliance upon the Privacy Shield. With regard to the Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer, for example, we remain liable if our agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit: <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>

MURAL is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. We are committed to resolving complaints from EU and Swiss data subjects pursuant to the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle.

In compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, MURAL commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first contact MURAL at [support@mural.co](mailto:support@mural.co).

MURAL has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to BBB PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by MURAL, please visit [ https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/](https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/) for more information and to file a complaint. If these processes do not result in a resolution, you may also contact your local data protection authority, the US Department of Commerce, and/or the Federal Trade Commission for assistance. If your complaint still remains unresolved, then you have the right to invoke binding arbitration by the Privacy Shield Panel upon written notice to MURAL at [support@mural.co](mailto:support@mural.co).

## DMCA Policy

We take the intellectual property rights of others seriously and require that our Customers and their Authorized Users do the same. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act established a process for addressing claims of copyright infringement that we have implemented for MURAL services. If you own a copyright or have authority to act on behalf of a copyright owner and want to report a claim that a third party is infringing that material on or through a MURAL service, please send a notice to our copyright agent that includes all of the items below and we will expeditiously take appropriate action:

  1. A description of the copyrighted work that you claim is being infringed;
  2. A description of the material you claim is infringing and that you want removed or access to which you want disabled and the URL or other location of that material;
  3. Your address, telephone number, and email address;
  4. The following statement: “I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted material I am complaining of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (e.g., as a fair use)”;
  5. The following statement: “The information in this notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, I am the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of the copyright or of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed”; and
  6. An electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or a person authorized to act on the owner's behalf.



For this type of claims please contact us as set forth in the "Contacting us" section below.

We may, in appropriate circumstances, disable or terminate the accounts of users who may be repeat infringers.

This process does not limit our ability to pursue any other remedies we may have to address suspected infringement.

By submitting a Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") Infringement Notification or other communication (including communications about content stored on or transmitted through this Service), you consent to have this communication forwarded to the person or entity who stored or transmitted the content addressed by your communications in order to facilitate a prompt resolution. For notices other than DMCA Infringement Notifications, upon request, we will edit out your name and contact information. However, DMCA Infringement Notifications (including any Personally-Identifiable Information set forth in the notifications) will be forwarded as submitted to us without any deletions.
