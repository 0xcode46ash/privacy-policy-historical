## Murad Data Protection & Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

Murad is a leading skincare products and spa treatment company with customers around the world.  Protecting consumer privacy is of utmost importance to us.  We are committed to safeguarding our customers’ personal data.

**Collection and Use of Personal Information**

Personal Information means information that (1) is recorded in any form; (2) is about, or pertains to a specific individual; and (3) can be linked to that individual.

You provide Personal Information to Murad via the following ways:

\- Ordering Online: When you create an individual account online at www.murad.com, we may collect a variety of information, such as name, mailing address, email address, phone number, and credit card information.

\- Phone/Fax: When you call Murad’s Customer Care/Third-Party Partner for consultation on our products or ordering products, we may ask and collect information such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, and credit card information.

\- In-Person consultation at a local kiosk as part of a skin health evaluation service.

Murad will only use your Personal Information for purposes relevant to the manner in which it was asked.  Murad may use your Personal Information to provide you with services or products being purchased.  Murad may transfer your Personal Information to companies that are performing services for Murad.  Murad may also use the information you provide us to help personalize product information and offers.  We only use your name and mailing address information to mail you promotional items, news and offers.   **We will never give or sell your user information or email address to anyone without your consent.**

_Access_

Murad allows individual access to their Personal Information and al­lows the individual to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.  You may review your Personal Information by contacting us using one of the options below. You may also choose to opt-out of email alerts or deleting your Personal Information from our systems.

**Cookies and Your Computer**

Like most e-commerce websites, we use "cookie" technology.  A cookie is a very small text file that a website can save onto your computer's hard disk to store your information and settings.  When you log on, the cookie tells us whether you have visited us before or are a new visitor.  It doesn't track any personal information, give us the means to contact you, extract information from your computer or deliver viruses.  Furthermore, your address or credit card information is never stored in a cookie.  Cookies are simply the most efficient way for us to be able to offer you an enjoyable online shopping environment.

**Data Protection for Children**

**Data Security**

Online

Murad takes reasonable steps to protect our customers’ Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  Murad has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and manage­rial procedures to safeguard and secure the Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.

Murad believes in providing a safe and secure shopping experience for all of our clients.  We provide stringent and effective security measures on our website.

It is our policy to never send private information, such as your credit card number, via email.  In fact, this is a practice we recommend you adopt in all of your Internet activities.

We designed Murad.com to accept orders only from Web browsers that permit communication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.  This means you'll be unable to inadvertently place an order through an unsecured connection.

Internal Controls

Customer Personal Information on paper are shredded and disposed of securely when no longer required. Where required, customer Personal Information on paper are kept in locked filing cabinets or stored off-site in secure third-party managed facilities.

Customer Personal Information kept electronically is protected by access controls such as strong passwords and the worldwide standard encryption AES-256.  Murad also maintains systems that are physically secured and logically secured by firewalls and other security software (Anti-Virus, Intrusion Detection Systems).  Murad’s systems are continuously patched for vulnerabilities and validated by external third parties.

Customer Personal Information transmitted over unsecure networks (public internet) is always encrypted with strong AES-256 encryption and only with trusted external entities (ie Third-Party Providers that take/process customer orders).

**Enforcement**

Murad uses a self-assessment approach to assure compliance with this policy and periodically verifies that the policy is accurate, compre­hensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented and accessible and in conformity with the statements.  We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns using the con­tact information provided and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal informa­tion in accordance with the statements.

**Third-Party Ad-Servers**

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf.  These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single-pixel .gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness.  Any information these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.

**Links**

For your convenience, our website may contain links to other sites.  Murad.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

**Legal Disclaimer**

We will share personal information if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, such as a court order or subpoena, or a request by law enforcement or governmental authorities.

**Safe Harbor**

The seven principles and fifteen Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) referred to in this policy constitute Safe Harbor privacy framework. These principles and FAQs may be found at: <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>
