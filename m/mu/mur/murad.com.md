**Cookies and your computer**  
Like most e-commerce websites, we use â€˜cookie' technology. A cookie is a very small text file that a website can save onto your computer's hard disk to store your information and settings. When you log on, the cookie tells us whether you have visited us before or are a new visitor. It doesn't track any personal information, give us the means to contact you, extract information from your computer, or deliver viruses. Furthermore, your address or credit card information is never stored in a cookie. Cookies are simply the most efficient way for us to be able to offer you an enjoyable online shopping environment.

**Disclosure of personal information**  
Any information you provide to us at this site when you establish or update an account, enter a contest, shop online or request information (i.e. name, address, email address, telephone number and credit card information), is maintained in private files on our secure Web server and our internal systems. This information is used to enable Murad.com to deliver services and information about our products to you.
