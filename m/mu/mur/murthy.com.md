At the Murthy Law Firm, keeping your information safe has always been a priority. Although there have been no changes in our procedures, we have updated our Privacy Policy for clarity, in light of the recent requirements per the 2018 EU General Data Protection Regulation.

We never share or sell our lists. You are sent only the information you requested or to which you subscribed.

## Murthy Teleconferences

Our [teleconference](https://www.murthy.com/about-us/online-services/teleconferences/) mailing list is also managed by MailChimp, but we control enrollment manually, as it is a service intended for employers.
