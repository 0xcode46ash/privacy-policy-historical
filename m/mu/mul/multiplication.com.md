**Multiplication.com _Privacy Policy_**

This "Privacy Policy" applies to the Websites controlled by Krimsten Publishing LLC and/or its subsidiary and affiliated entities ("Krimsten Publishing", “Multiplication.com,” "us", "we", or "our") where the Privacy Policy is posted.  "Website" includes sites hosted by one or more web servers {however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise (collectively, "Computer")} and other interactive features, applications or downloads that are operated by us and that are available through, or interact with, Websites where this Privacy Policy is posted.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to our collection of information from other sources (unless specifically stated).  Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy, which includes compliance with California Privacy Rights (see also [http://www.privacyprotection.ca.gov](http://www.privacyprotection.ca.gov/)).

We have adopted this Privacy Policy to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.  This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of Use posted on our Website, sets forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website.  Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.

We generally keep this Privacy Policy posted on our Website and you should review it frequently, as we reserve the right to change it from time to time without prior notice to you.  Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Privacy Policy.  Krimsten Publishing will not use your personally identifiable information, however, in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time it was collected without your consent.  WHEN YOU ACCESS OUR WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, OR TO ANY CHANGES WE MAY SUBSEQUENTLY MAKE, IMMEDIATELY STOP ACCESSING OUR WEBSITE.

 **A. INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

Our Website typically collects two (2) kinds of information about you: (a) information that you provide that personally identifies you; and (b) information that does not.

  1.  **Personally Identifiable Information:**  
Our definition of personally identifiable information includes any information that may be used to specifically identify or contact you, such as your name, mail address, phone number, etc.  As a general policy, we do not automatically collect your personally identifiable information when you visit our Website.  In certain circumstances, we may request, allow or otherwise provide you an opportunity to submit your personally identifiable information in connection with a feature, program, promotion or some other aspect of our Website.  For instance, you may:  (a) provide your name, mail/shipping address, e-mail address, credit card number and phone number when using our online store; or (b) provide your e-mail address when registering with our Website.  Certain information may not be personally identifiable when standing alone (e.g., your age), but may become so when combined with other information (e.g., your age and name).  Whether or not you provide this information is your choice; however, in many instances this type of information is required to participate in the particular activity, realize a benefit we may offer or gain access to certain content on our Website.
  2.  **Non-Personal Information:**  
Our definition of non-personal information is any information that does not personally identify you.  Non-personal information can include certain personally identifiable information that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous.  We and/or our third party service providers obtain non-personal information about you from information that you provide us, either separately or together with your personally identifiable information.  We and/or our third party service providers also automatically collect certain non-personal information from you when you access our Website.

 **B. HOW WE USE & SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED**

  1.  **Personally Identifiable Information:**  
The personally identifiable information you submit to us is generally used to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries, better serve you or in other ways naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the information.  We may also use this information to later contact you for a variety of reasons, such as customer service, to provide you with information or services or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive, to provide you with marketing or promotional information for our products or those of other affiliated companies (“affiliated companies”), to communicate with you about content or other information you have posted or shared with us via our Website or with regard to your use of the Website and, in our discretion, changes to the Website and/or Website policies, for internal business purposes, or for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.  You may opt-out from receiving future promotional information from us, or direct that we not share your information in the future with any affiliated companies or third parties for their direct marketing purposes, as set forth below in Section I.  In certain instances we may also share your personally identifiable information with our third-party vendors performing functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our affiliated companies) – e.g., vendors that process credit card orders, deliver our merchandise, administer our promotions, provide us marketing or promotional assistance, analyze our data, assist us with customer service, etc.  Our vendors agree to use this information, and we share information with them, only to carry out our requests.  Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or as set forth when you submit the information, your personally identifiable information will not be shared or sold to third parties without your consent.
  2.  **Non-Personal Information:**  
Web site usage information may be collected using various methods, such as the following:
    1.  **Web Beacons** \- Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and e-mail messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.   Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Websites, to monitor how users navigate the Websites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
    2.  **Cookies** \- A cookie is a data file placed on a Computer when it is used to visit the Websites.  Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking user preferences and web pages visited while using the Websites.  You may be able to remove, reject and/or disable some types of cookies using your browser’s preferences or other programs.  Some features of the Websites may not function properly or may operate slowly if you disable, delete, or refuse to accept cookies.  Some of the cookies we use may be “Flash” cookies.  A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Computer via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Computer.  While they are harmless, depending on your browser, these cookies may not be deleted when your cookies are deleted or disabled and, in some instances, they may cause your cookies to reappear in your browser.  Please check your browser to determine where these types of cookies are stored and how they may be deleted or disabled.
    3.  **Mobile Device Identifiers** \- Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices and we or our third-party service providers may receive such device information if you access the Websites through mobile devices.  Certain features of our Websites may require collection of mobile phone numbers, and we may associate that phone number to mobile device identification information.  Additionally, some mobile phone service providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service.  Depending on the provider, we or our third-party service providers may receive this information.
    4.  **Embedded Scripts** \- An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Websites, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Computer from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Website, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.  
 
  3.  **Information You Provide About a Third Party**  
If you send someone else a communication from the Websites, such as sending Website content to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Website, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend​  
 
  4.  **Information Third Parties Provide About** **You**  
We may also, from time to time, supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.  We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Website.  In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal identifiable information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time you provide your personally identifiable information.



 **C. OTHER USES**

  1.  **E-mail Communications:**  
If you send us an e-mail with questions or comments, we may use your personally identifiable information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your questions or comments for future reference.  For security reasons, we do not recommend that you send non-public personally identifiable information, such as passwords, social security numbers or bank account information, to us by e-mail.  Further, we may send you e-mail under the following circumstances: (a) if you request a particular service or sign up for a feature that involves e-mail communications; (b) if it relates to purchases you have made with us (e.g., product updates, customer support, etc.); (c) if we are sending you information about our other products and services; (d) if you consented to being contacted by e-mail for a particular purpose; (e) if you send us an e-mail, post information on the Websites (i.e., a blog) or otherwise submit information to us electronically, we may e-mail you to follow-up or otherwise communicate with you with respect thereto; (f) to provide you legal notices or notices with respect to your use of the Websites; or (g) to otherwise facilitate a transaction between us.  In certain instances, we may provide you with tools on the Website that will allow you to set your preferences for receiving e-mail communications from us; that is, agree to some communications but not others.  You may “opt out” of receiving future commercial e-mail communications from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link or following the other instructions included at the bottom of most e-mails we send, or as provided below in Section I; provided, however, we reserve the right to send you transactional e-mails such as customer service communications.  
 
  2.  **Transfer of Assets:**  
As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets.  If another entity acquires us or all (or substantially all) of our assets, the personally identifiable information and non-personal information we have about you will be transferred to and used by this acquiring entity, provided the successor entity is subject to the same commitments for the previously collected student information.   Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.  Again, provided the successor entity is subject to the same commitments for previously collected student information.  
 
  3.  **Other:**  
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or non-personal information about you if we are required to do so by law, with respect to notices and counter-notices pursuant to our DMCA notice and takedown policy and procedures and/or if we believe that such action is necessary to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property, our Websites, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of our Websites’ users or the general public.  
 
  4.  **Your California Privacy Rights:**  
Residents of the State of California, under certain provisions of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed certain personally identifiable information as defined under California law during the preceding year for third party direct marketing purposes.  You are limited to one request per calendar year.  In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response.  You may request the information in writing at:

Scripps Networks, LLC  
1180 Avenue of the Americas  
New York, NY 10036  
Attn: California Privacy Request  
[privacy@scrippsnetworks.com](mailto:privacy@scrippsnetworks.com) 

  5.  **Third Party Ad Server Networks:**



We have implemented “do not track” coding and scripting for our ad networks.  We honor “do not track” (DNT) signals.   We do not link the information stored in cookies to any personally identifiable information.  

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.  Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members will no longer be able to deliver targeted content and/or ads to you, which will affect this and other web sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads.  Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.  Additional information is available on the NAI’s web site accessible by the above link.

 **D. CHILDREN**

The features, programs, promotions and other aspects of our Websites requiring personally identifiable information are not intended for children.  We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13).  If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen (13) and believe he or she has disclosed personally identifiable information to us, please contact us at contact@multiplication.com.  A parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen (13) may review and request deletion of such child’s personally identifiable information as well as prohibit the use thereof.  A description of the specific types of information collected from a child under the age of thirteen (13) will be provided to the parent or guardian of that child upon the parent or guardian’s request.  We will not collect, maintain, use or share student personal information beyond that needed for authorized educational purposes or as authorized by the parent or teacher. We will not build a personal profile of a student other than for supporting authorized educational purposes or as authorized by the parent or teacher. We will not knowingly retain student personal information beyond the time period required to support the authorized educational purposes or as authorized by the parent or teacher.  In response to COPPA rules, we have opted out of behaviorally targeted ads for children under the age of 13 and instead show contextually based ads which are not based on a user’s browsing behavior.

 **E. KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE**

We have implemented comprehensive security measures we consider reasonable and appropriate to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of against the loss of the information under our control.  Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information.  In the unfortunate event that your “personally identifiable information” (as the term or similar terms are defined by any applicable law requiring notice upon a security breach) is compromised, we may notify you by e-mail (at our sole and absolute discretion) to the last e-mail address you have provided us in the most expedient time reasonable under the circumstances; provided, however, delays in notification may occur while we take necessary measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity to the system as well as for the legitimate needs of law enforcement if notification would impede a criminal investigation.  From time to time we evaluate new technology for protecting information, and when appropriate, we upgrade our information security systems.

 **F. OTHER SITES/LINKS**

Our Website may link to or contain links to other third party websites that we do not control or maintain, such as in connection with purchasing products referenced on our Website and banner advertisements.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third party website.  When possible, we warn you that you are leaving Multiplication.com.  After leaving Multiplication.com, you are subject to the terms and conditions (including privacy policy) of another website and/or destination.  We encourage you to note when you leave our Websites and to read the privacy statements of all third party websites before submitting any personally identifiable information.  You should not rely on our Terms to govern your use of another website or destination.
