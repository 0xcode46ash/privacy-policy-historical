# Privacy Policy | Multiplay

### 1\. INTRODUCTION

Multiplay UK Limited and its affiliates (collectively “Multiplay”) offer a variety of products and services for game Developers and game players that will be referred to in this policy as the “Service” or “Services.” Because we would like to avoid excessive formality and make this information easy to understand, the policy refers to Multiplay as “we” or “us” and to the reader as “you.” When we say “device,” we mean any device, including desktop, laptop, PC or Mac computers, smartphones, tablets, or any other device that is used to access or interact with the Service. When we say “Developer,” we mean a third party using Multiplay Services. By using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy and understand that we may transfer your data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).

This Privacy Policy governs our information practices for the Service, which includes any websites, where a link to this policy is provided. It describes how we collect, use, share, and protect information from Developers, players, or people browsing or using our sites (collectively “Users”) when Users access or interact with or use our Service. This includes when Users:

  * Visit Multiplay websites;
  * Choose to interact with the Multiplay and forum pages on the Services;
  * Use our B2C Game servers and voice over internet phone (VOIP) services;
  * Use Multiplay Developer Services;
  * Play games or use applications created by Developers and hosted on Multiplay Software;
  * Play games or use applications that employ Multiplay Analytics to help Developers understand how their applications perform;
  * Play games or use applications that employ the Multiplay Service to help facilitate multiplayer game play.



We receive information about Users, their devices, locations, and interactions with the Service primarily in two ways:

  * Actively: When Users actively provide us with information. For example, when a User creates an account with Multiplay, he or she will type in a name, username, and email address and may be required to provide a date of birth or other information.
  * Passively: When our systems automatically collect information about browsers, devices, and certain activity within the Service. For example, when Users access games that employ Google Analytics, our systems (with assistance from the Developers who want our help to analyze the use of their games) may automatically collect a variety of information from User devices and User game activity, including device name, device characteristics, unique identifiers, and platform identifiers (e.g., SteamIDs).
