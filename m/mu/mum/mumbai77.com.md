**Privacy Policy**
* Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site.  

* Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.

Because publisher sites and laws across countries vary, we're unable to suggest specific privacy policy language. However, you may wish to review resources such as the 

[_Network Advertising Initiative_](http://www.networkadvertising.org/), or NAI, which suggests the following language for data collection of non-personally identifying information:

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.

You can find additional information in Appendix A of the 

[_NAI Self-Regulatory principles_](http://www.networkadvertising.org/pdfs/NAI_principles.pdf) for publishers (PDF). Please note that the NAI may change this sample language at any time.
