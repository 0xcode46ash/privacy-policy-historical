### What does this Privacy Policy apply to?

The website you are currently visiting is operated by MumboJumbo located at 219 North Lamar Street, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75202. This Privacy Policy currently applies to the website(s) operated by MumboJumbo and its affiliates and subsidaries (collectively referred to as "MumboJumbo Websites" or "our Websites"). 

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through the MumboJumbo Websites (as listed above), and does not apply to information that may be collected by MumboJumbo offline. In addition, this Privacy Policy does not extend to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link. Because we cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of such, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of the website to which you link before you submit any personal information to that site.

Please note that by using our Websites, you signify your assent to MumboJumbo's Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Websites. We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our Websites or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change. Please check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of these changes. Your continued use of our Websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.

### What types of information does MumboJumbo collect?

In order to give you the best experience on our Websites, MumboJumbo may collect information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Typically, we may ask you to submit personal and/or demographic information in connection with any one of the following features or services:

  * Website and game-specific registration 
  * Product support 
  * Online store 



Also we receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies" (as we explain below) and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses MumboJumbo.com. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at MumboJumbo.com if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.

We will ask you to create a username and password and to provide other non-personal information such as your age range, state of residence and favorite types of games you prefer and other information (also known as "demographic information"). If demographic information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, we may combine the demographic information with your personal information. Combining data allows us to customize the notices we send you and the services we provide you according to your interests and preferences. For more on how we use your information, please read the section on use below. 

We also may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. For example we use a third party company to process orders for games that we sell and, process credit card payments. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Any credit card information collected by that company is not shared with us. Such vendors have their own privacy policies which are made available to you when you are referred to their sites.

No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives. 

### How does MumboJumbo use the information it collects?

Generally, information that we collect for a particular purpose is used for that purpose only. For example, if you request product support, the email address that you provide will only be used for purposes of diagnosing your specific technical problem and providing an acceptable solution. Information collected from those who register on our Websites is used to provide registrants the benefits associated with such registration (e.g., subscription to newsletter). In some instances, however, you may also be given the option to have your information used for an activity or service different from the activity or service that you are requesting (e.g., to have your name entered into a contest when subscribing to our newsletter or vice versa). If you choose to receive these additional services, MumboJumbo will use your information to provide them to you. 

We may use your email address to send you service-related announcements that tell you about updates to our Privacy Policy, new areas or features on our Websites, changes to our online service or technical support policies, and other related changes. 

We may also use your personal and demographic information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs. Although we can assure you that any personal information gathered in this context will be used solely for its intended purpose, such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy.

We have a policy of No Spam. No Spy-ware. That's our commitment to you.

### What happens if you choose not to provide us with personal information?

If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities on our Websites and may limit the services we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to share your email address, you may not be able to receive our newsletter or product support. To simply browse our Websites or to demo any of our games, you do not need to give us any personal information.
