We do not provide any personal information to any third parties under any circumstances. We gather two types of information about users:

1) Data that users provide through optional, voluntary registration on several of our sites, and 2) aggregated tracking information input on or through our sites.

Such information enables us to focus on our customer desires and helps our advertisers better understand the demographics of our audience. Because we may derive a portion of our revenue from advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential. **At no time is information of a personal nature disclosed.**
