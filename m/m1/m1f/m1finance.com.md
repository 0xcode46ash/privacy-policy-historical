# M1 Finance | Privacy Policy

**Overview**

M1 Finance LLC considers your privacy our utmost concern. In order to provide you with individualized service, we collect certain nonpublic personal information about you from information you provide on applications or other forms (such as name, address, social security number, age, financial status, assets, income, tax information, retirement and estate plan information, transaction history, account balance, payment history, investment objectives, marital status, family relationships, and other personal information). We may also collect such information through your inquiries by mail, e-mail or telephone.

We do not sell any nonpublic personal information about you to anyone. We also do not share such information except when needed to process transactions at your request or to make you aware of related financial products and services that we offer. Here are more of the details:

  * In order to complete certain transactions or make account changes that you direct, it may be necessary to provide identifying information to companies, individuals or groups that are affiliated with M1. For example, if you request the transfer of assets from another financial institution to M1 Finance LLC, we will need to provide certain information about you to that company to complete the transaction.
  * In order to service your account and effect your transactions, we may provide your personal information, as described above, to unaffiliated companies that perform administrative and other services on our behalf, such as transfer agents. We will provide these third parties with only the information necessary to carry out their assigned responsibilities. These outside companies will use this information only for the services for which we hired them, and are not permitted to use or share this information for any other purpose, except as permitted by law.
  * Finally, we will release information about you only if you direct us to do so, if we are compelled by law to do so, or in other legally limited circumstances (for example, to protect your account from fraud).

If you decide at some point either to close your account(s) or to become an inactive customer, we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice.

With regard to our internal security procedures, we restrict access to your personal and account information to those employees who need to know the information in order to provide products and services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your nonpublic personal information.

As required by federal law, we will notify you of our privacy policy annually. We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time, and if we do change it, you will be informed promptly.
