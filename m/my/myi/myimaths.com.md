## PRIVACY POLICY 

### Updated on: 10 October 2012

### Effective from: 10 October 2012

This privacy policy is specific to the MyiMaths website ("Website") and overrides any other privacy policy appearing elsewhere on Oxford University Press websites. 

Oxford University Press ("OUP", "we", "us" or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy online. Our policy explains how we will do this. We will review this policy in the light of comments we receive so please check the latest version. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact us by emailing us at [mail@myimaths.com](mailto:mail@myimaths.com). 

By using the Website, you are accepting the practices described in this statement.

#### What kind of information do we collect and how do we use it?

When you subscribe to or ask for further information about the Website, we ask for your name, email address, postal address, and other relevant personal information. Personal information submitted in this way is added to our access control database, hosted by a third party hosting company, and to our customer databases at OUP's premises. This information will be updated if you inform us of any changes.

We may use information in our customer databases to send you information about us and our products which we think may be of interest to you, electronically or otherwise. In the case of subscribers, your personal information will also be used to enable us to verify you are a subscriber and to deliver the Website to you.

We request personal information (such as your name, email address and other contact details) from you when you contact us with subscription management queries, technical problems, to comment on the Website , or when you ask for information about how to use the service. Personal information submitted by you via contact us will not be added to our customer database and we request it simply so that we can respond to you about your query. Statistics regarding the types of queries submitted to us via contact us may be collated by us in aggregate form so that we can effectively monitor the site and improve levels of service.

If you have asked for information or subscribed to the Website in the past and no longer use the service and do not wish us to store information about you, please contact us and we will remove your details from our customer database. We need to store information about current subscribers in order to fulfil our contractual requirements to you and in order to deliver the Website to you.

Unless you have informed us that you do not wish to receive further information about our products, we may send you direct mail.

You may notify us either in writing or by telephone, fax or email that you object to being contacted in a particular stated way. If you use more than one email address to communicate with us, please notify us of each email account you use.

#### When do we share information?

We do not sell your personal information to others.

We share your information within OUP. We also share your information to our affiliates and licensors and supplier which assist us in making the Website available to you on the Website (e.g. our hosting supplier) but we have agreed with those third parties that they will keep your information secure and not use it for other purposes. 

If we believe that your use of the Website is unlawful or damaging to others, we reserve the right to disclose the information we have obtained through the Website about you to the extent that it is reasonably necessary in our opinion to prevent, remedy or take action in relation to such conduct. 

We may also disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply any agreements or licences with you; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of OUP, our affiliates, our licensors and suppliers and/or our customers. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

If any part of our business (including those of our affiliates) is sold or integrated with another business, your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers.
