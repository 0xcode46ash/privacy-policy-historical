# myITforum.com : Privacy Statement

|  | Privacy Statement  
---  
  
Welcome to the MyITForum Web site (the "Site"). We at MyITForum understand the value of personal information and are committed to the protection of customer privacy and data. To demonstrate that commitment, this statement discloses the privacy practices for myitforum.com. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy statement or the practices of this Site, please contact: [rodtrent@yahoo.com](mailto:rodtrent@yahoo.com). 

**General Principles**

 **Notice.**   
We endeavor to provide all visitors to the Site with full disclosure of our information practices. We will explicitly ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you. In such event, we will let you know what information is being collected, how it is collected, for what purposes it is collected, and to whom such information may be disclosed. We will also identify which information is necessary to participate in the offering or activity and which information is optional. Whenever we request additional or optional information, we identify those requests as voluntary so that you know the information is not mandatory in order to participate in the offering or activity. 

This Site contains links to other Web sites. Please be aware that MyItForum is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites; this privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Site. 

**Consent.**   
You may choose not to provide personal information, in which case you may still freely browse the Site. Although participation in some online services and offerings may require information about yourself, providing such information is entirely optional and not a requirement to browse Site generally. When you provide personally identifiable information that may be used for purposes not specifically related to the purpose for which the information was collected, we will provide an opportunity to opt-out of such uses. 

**Access.**   
You may access and make any changes to your personal information at any time by contacting or by forwarding updated information to our [E-business Department](mailto:webmaster@altiris.com). You may also tell us whether or not you want the Site (or other third party sites) to send you marketing information. 

**Security.**   
We take all reasonable measures to safeguard and protect personally identifiable information from unauthorized access and misuse. If for any reason you believe that the Site has not adhered to these principles, please contact our [webmaster](mailto:rodtrent@yahoo.com). 

Any other concerns or questions about this Site or the practices of this Site may be addressed to our [Legal Department](mailto:cchristensen@altiris.com).
