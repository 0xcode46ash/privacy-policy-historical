**Privacy policy  
Your privacy is important to STACOS. This statement discloses the information practices for STACOS Web sites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared.**

**Personal information**   
In general, you can visit STACOS **** on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when we or our partners may need information from you.

You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address or e-mail id, to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you with a subscription. You may give us your credit card details to buy something from us or a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at **STACOS ****** that you wish to be considered for. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so.

**Using and Sharing Personal Information**   
The following paragraphs describe in more detail how **STACOS ****** may use your personal information and with whom we may share it. Depending on the type of **STACOS ****** Web site you are visiting, one or more of the paragraphs may apply. For example, if you order a product from an **STACOS ****** Web site, your information will be handled as described in such paragraphs as Fulfilling Your Transaction Request and Marketing Use.

  
**Fulfilling your transaction request**   
If you request something from an **STACOS ****** Web site, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information, with others, for instance, other parts of **STACOS ****** , **STACOS ****** Associates, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal or government authorities (for example, Income tax authorities) involved in fulfillment. In connection with a transaction we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.

**Marketing Use**   
The information you provide to **STACOS ****** on certain **STACOS ****** Web sites may also be used by **STACOS ****** and selected third parties for marketing purposes. Before we use it, however, we will offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used in this way. You can opt out of such programs.

**STACOS **** Discussion Forums and Chat Rooms **   
If you participate in an **STACOS ****** discussion forum or chat room, you should be aware that the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside **STACOS, ****** who have access to that discussion forum or chat room. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. Each participant's opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of **STACOS ******.

**Other STACOS **** Web Site Notices **   
In some cases, specific **STACOS ****** Web sites may contain other notices about their use and the information practices applicable to those sites.

  
**Information Security and Quality**   
We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its quality. We implement appropriate measures and processes, such as using encryption when transmitting certain sensitive information, to help us to keep your information secure and to maintain its quality.

  
**Supplementing Information**   
From time to time we may supplement information you give us via an **STACOS **** **Web site with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information about businesses. This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide a better service.

**Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies**   
We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on **STACOS ****** Web sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." **STACOS ****** or others on **STACOS's ****** behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.

Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in an non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies.

We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some **STACOS ****** pages use cookies, sent by **STACOS ****** or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Web site. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work properly.

**Service Quality Monitoring**   
Certain Web transactions may also involve you calling us or our calling you. Please be aware that it is **STACOS** 's general practice to monitor and in some cases record such calls for staff training or quality assurance purposes.

  
**Online Advertising**   
Certain companies help us deliver interactive on-line advertising such as banner ads. These companies may collect and use information about customers to help us better understand the offers, promotions, and types of advertising that are most appealing to our customers. 

**Personalized URL Link**   
On occasion, we may personalize and customize Web sites for certain visitors. If you visit one of these sites, you may find it customized with references to products and/or services that we believe may be of interest to you, based on your previous interactions with **STACOS ****** and information you have provided to us. While you are visiting these Web sites, we may collect information about your visit to better tailor the site to your interests. An invitation to visit one of these Web sites is usually presented as a personalized URL in an e-mail, a notice on a Web site registration page, or as a response to you logging on to a certain Web site.

If you choose to visit one of these Web sites, you are agreeing to let **STACOS ****** collect information about your visits and also to its association with other information about you and your relationship with **STACOS ****** . If you do not wish your information to be used in this way, do not accept the invitation to visit these sites.

  
**Disclosures Required By Law**   
Please be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government orders.

  
_**Links to non-STACOS **** Web sites **   
**STACOS ****** Web sites may contain links to other Web sites. **STACOS **** **is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other Web sites._
