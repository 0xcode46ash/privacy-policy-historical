# myFICO - Privacy Policy

We understand and respect your desire to know how information about you will be collected, used and kept secure. We've created this description to provide you meaningful information about the privacy practices and policy applicable to www.myFICO.com.

**Putting Your Information to Work**  


We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:

  * Information we receive from you, such as when you register for and order the services we provide, whether alone or in conjunction with other companies (the "Services"), or such as when you send us e-mail, applications and other forms. 
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates and others. 
  * Information we receive from third parties, such as consumer reporting agencies and companies that provide demographic information.



We use this information to provide you the Services and support for the Services, as well as for various internal business purposes such as: customer service; fraud prevention; providing you information relating to the Services; and broadening and improving the services and products we can offer.

**Disclosing Your Information**  


We may disclose any and all of the information we collect, as described above, to the following types of unaffiliated third parties (companies that are not owned or controlled by us) for various business purposes, including marketing and joint business efforts for related and unrelated products and services:

  * Financial services providers, such as banks and mortgage lenders. 
  * Non-financial companies such as retailers, direct marketers and publishers. 
  * Companies that perform marketing services on our behalf and other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements. 
  * Others, as permitted by law.



We may also disclose any and all of the information we collect to companies that are related to us by common ownership or affiliated with us by common control. We may disclose as described above whether you are a consumer who purchases a one-time service, a customer with whom we have an ongoing relationship, or a former customer. However, we will not disclose to third parties the consumer report or credit score calculated in providing any Service without your prior specific approval. If Fair Isaac is acquired by or merges with another company, information will be transferred to the acquiring company. Fair Isaac will also share information in order to comply with the law, e.g., in response to subpoenas, to assert or defend legal claims, and in order to investigate or respond to actual or suspected illegal activities, fraud, and threats of physical harm.

**Your Right to Choose**  


If you prefer that we not disclose nonpublic personal information about you, you may opt out of such disclosures; that is, you may direct us not to make these disclosures. You may also opt out if you prefer that we not send you offers regarding products and services. If you exercise this opt out we will not send you any product or service offers, except that we may, as part of the Services, tell you about credit products that may be available to you. You may exercise your right to opt out when you register for the Services by checking "No" in answer to the question in the order form regarding sharing of your information. You may also exercise your right to opt out any time by logging into Member Services, clicking on "Manage Member Information", and checking "No" to the same question. Please note that your decision to opt out will not apply to certain disclosures that are specifically permitted by law; for example, the Services cannot operate unless we transmit data to companies that help us provide the Services, such as by processing credit card charges. Your decision to opt out also will not apply to disclosures or communications to which you consent.

**Keeping Your Information Secure**  


Except for the disclosures and uses described above, we restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees and companies that provide services and need to know that information to provide the Services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your nonpublic personal information. Information you provide to us when you register for and order the Services is transmitted to us through a secured socket layer (SSL) transmission. In addition, information we collect is subject to numerous measures designed to help protect it from unauthorized access or alteration, including for example, internal and external firewalls, physical security measures, and encryption of certain information. Of course, you must do your part to ensure the security of your information; for example, you must guard your password and not permit unauthorized use of your account. No security measures can provide absolute protection of data, but we will strive to provide a superior level of protection for your information.

To the extent that our Web sites contain links to other sites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites.

**What About Cookies?**  


A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server and stored by the Web browser so it can later be read back from that browser. Cookies enable the browser to identify itself to the server, and allow the server to maintain an active "session" with an individual user. Cookies help the browser remember some specific information. We make limited use of cookies; for example, cookies that we use are "per session" and are deleted once your browser is closed. 

**Children's Privacy**  


This site and the Service are intended for use only by adults. We will not knowingly solicit or collect information from children.

**Keeping Up-to-Date**  


We want you to be fully informed about how we will protect your privacy. We may change our policy in the future, but we will not change our practices until we have notified you. You agree that we may notify you of changes in our policy through this Web site. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or about our information practices, you can send us your question by clicking on [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/myfico/ContactUs.asp).

**Scope of Policy**  


This Policy applies to individuals using the Services described above from Fair Isaac Corporation for personal, family or household purposes, unless a different privacy policy is provided in connection with a specific service. Certain practices described and rights provided herein may not apply to institutional users or individuals who use the Services for business purposes.
