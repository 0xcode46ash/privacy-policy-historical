Questions regarding this statement should be directed to Customer Service at privacy@myfw.com. 

The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the myFW.com Web site.

**Cookies**  
What are Cookies?  
Some Web sites store information in a small text file, called a "cookie," on your hard disk.  
Cookies contain information about You and your preferences. It might only contain a record of which pages within the site You visited, to help the site customize the view for You the next time You visit.  
Only the information that You provide, or the choices You make while visiting a Web site, can be stored in a cookie. For example, the site cannot determine Your e-mail name unless You choose to type it. Allowing a Web site to create a cookie does not give that or any other site access to the rest of Your computer, and only the site that created the cookie can read it.  
However, You can specify (in your browser) that You be prompted before a site puts a cookie on your hard disk, so You can choose to allow or disallow the cookie; or You can prevent Your browser from accepting any cookies.  
You can specify different settings for different security zones. For example, You might want to allow Web sites to create cookies if they are in your Trusted sites or Local intranet zone, prompt You before creating cookies if they are in your Internet zone, and never allow cookies if they are in Your Restricted sites zone.

At myFW.com we use cookies to maintain Your user session, personalize your experience, and extend certain functionality within the MyFW.com site. You may choose not to use the cookies, in which case You will need to enter your password each time you want to access Your personalized myFW.com member profile. We do not store Your click stream profile or any other information collected as part of the cookie in our database.

**Security**  
myFW.com has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Your information is stored in a server without direct Web access and is protected by a firewall.   
While data is at rest, we have put measures in place to protect sensitive information from theft or misuse.   
If You have concerns about the security of Your personal information please write to us: privacy@myfw.com.

**What Information We Collect/How We Use It**

Contact Information. myFW.com's registration form requests You provide contact information (like Your name and e-mail address). Some of the requested information is required in order to gain access to and use of some of the services on myFW.com; other information is optional. The required information is clearly marked as such on the registration pages. We use Your information in four ways:   
1\. to send personalized, targeted information to the You in the form of e-mail messages;   
2\. to send targeted advertising that allows us to provide our service at no cost to You;   
3\. to contact You for feedback and surveys; and   
4\. to send You other information about myFW.com. 

Profile Data. Profile data is also collected at myFW.com. We use this data to tailor Your myFW.com experience through our FW emails. By obtaining this information, we can provide You with specific content that we think you might be interested in, according to Your preferences and interests. You may include only the information that you feel comfortable including. However, the omission of certain information will limit the value of the myFW.com experience for You (for example, if we do not have information about Your specific interests, we will be unable to tailor specific content for Your FW email.) As a result, the more information we have about You, the more valuable the myFW.com experience will be for You.  
We also use Your profile information in the same four ways described in "Contact Information," above. 

Third Party Access to Your profile. As a rule we do not share any of your personal profile information with third parties without Your permission. The only case where Your personal information may be shared is when You grant specific permission to share Your profile with a named third party sponsor. You may (but are not required to) grant permission to contact You with information during the registration process or in response to a specific promotion. These sponsors are generally companies that sell consumer products and services about which You may be interested. The option for granting this permission is clearly marked on the registration pages or in the promotional material on myFW.com. If You grant us permission to share Your information with such third party sponsors, and then change Your mind, You may revoke Your permission; see "Changing Your Status," below. In addition, You can modify Your personal profile information at any time; see "Changing Your Status," below.

Reports. We provide reports to a limited number of companies with which we do business. These reports include aggregate information about our users. The information in these reports will not identify You individually. The outside companies who receive these reports will not be able to contact You from the information contained in the reports. We will not provide individual information to these companies without Your permission. The purpose of these reports is to show the results of marketing campaigns run on myFW.com.

Referral Program. As part of our referral program, we request contact information (like the name and e-mail address) of users friends and family whom think would like to receive the services available on myFW.com. The persons referred to us will receive a single promotional email inviting them to visit myFW.com, but do not become members until they confirm their interest in the service. The person referred does not have their information stored on our servers and will not be contacted again unless they register at myFW.com.

Links. myFW.com contains links to other sites but is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. If you have a question about the privacy policy of those Web sites, please visit them directly.

Contests. We run contests on myFW.com in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their name, e-mail address, and zip code). Sometimes we ask for similar information about referrals; see "Referral Program," above. We use and treat contact information from our contests as described in "Contact Information" and "Profile Data," above.

**Changing Your Status**  
Because we want our users to feel completely comfortable using myFW.com, we provide You with various opportunities to control how the information You provide to us is used. myFW.com gives users the following options to cancel our service and not receive future communications from us, direct that we not share their information with third parties (in cases where users previously granted us permission to share such information \- we do not share users' personal information with third parties without their permission), have us remove their information from our database, and change their profile information.

To unsubscribe from our service, follow the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any e-mail we send you. You will not receive any further communications from us and your personal information will be automatically deleted from our database.

To request that we not share Your personal information with sponsors (in cases where You previously granted us permission to share such information \- we do not share Your personal information with sponsors without Your permission), You can send a blank email to nosponsor@myFW.com. The request will be honored as soon as we receive it, but does not affect any information which You provided to us and which we shared with sponsors prior to our receipt of such request.

To have all of Your personal information removed from our database, send an email request to such effect to info@myFW.com. At the current time, we are not able to offer users the direct ability to delete their personal information from our database, but we will be happy to delete such information after we receive a request to that effect.  
If You would like to change any of Your profile information in our database, you can do so by following the "My Profile" link at the bottom of any email we send you, or by clicking the "My Profile" button on our homepage (www.Myfw.com), and following the directions. This will automatically change the information contained in our database.

You have a right to know what information we have on record and to request a copy of this information at anytime. If You want to know specifically who has access to Your personal profile and specifically what information we have on record, send an email to membercare@myfw.com requesting this information. We will send You a copy as soon as possible.
