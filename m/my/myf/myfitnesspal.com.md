# Privacy Policy | MyFitnessPal.com

**What's our policy?**  
MyFitnessPal.com takes your privacy seriously. We are committed to ensuring that the personal information we gather from you is secure and confidential. We do not sell, rent or trade our customers' personal data. 

**What type of information do we collect when you create a MyFitnessPal.com account?**  
The information we collect in order to create your MyFitnessPal.com account includes data such as your name and email address. The email address may be used to contact you with matters regarding MyFitnessPal, such as a newsletter, notifications of new messages from other MyFitnessPal members, or an announcement about a new product or service. We also collect some personal fitness information so that we can provide you with a personalized plan for successful weight loss. 

**What about other data?**  
By entering foods into your food diary or activities into your exercise log, you allow MyFitnessPal.com to provide you with a comprehensive analysis of your aggregate nutrition intake and fitness activity levels. It also allows us to plot for you charts of your weight, calorie intake and individual nutrient intake. ****

This information is not shared with anyone EXCEPT, from time to time; MyFitnessPal may create statistics based on users' diary entries, for example to determine what meal patterns have been most effective at losing weight among certain types of people. Your individual information will NEVER be shared with anybody else unless you provide your explicit consent (for instance, agreeing to become a “Friend” with another MyFitnessPal.com member to jointly lose weight and offer support to one another). As a condition to the consummation of a change in control or sale of substantially all the assets of MyFitnessPal to a third party, such third party shall agree to abide by the MyFitnessPal Privacy Statement.

  * it is necessary in our opinion to do so to prevent, investigate, detect or prosecute criminal offences or attacks on the technical integrity of our site(s) or our network; or 
  * it is necessary in our opinion to do so to protect the rights, property, or safety of MyFitnessPal.com and its employees, the users of our site(s), or the public. 



**How do we protect your information?**  
We make sure that every online communication with our customers meets our high standards of privacy and security. We do this by using a secure server with software that encrypts all of your confidential information before you send it to us. In addition, we take a range of measures to protect all customer data against unlawful or unauthorized access and have in place appropriate physical, technical and organizational security procedures to protect against damage, loss, destruction, misuse and alteration of customer data.
