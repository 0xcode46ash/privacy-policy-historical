**MyFamily.com, Inc. Statement of Privacy**

MyFamily.com recognizes the potential sensitivity of confidential information that may be placed on member family Web sites and is firmly committed to protecting your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site.

**Overview** __

None of the personal, private information that is uploaded or entered on a MyFamily.com Web site by individual members is viewed by MyFamily.com, or distributed to others outside of your site (except in rare cases involving reported violations of our use policies or legal statutes.) We do collect some data, always with your knowledge and consent, which is used to personalize the site for your convenience and for the benefit of other family members and friends who are included in your site. 

A portion of this data, particularly that which reflects members’ lifestyles and interests, may be used in aggregate statistical form to attract potential sponsors and deliver advertising messages to appropriate users. For instance we might tell a prospective advertiser that 10,000 of our members have indicated an interest in golf, and then distribute an attractive offer exclusively to those users. 

**In no case is the personal information about individual members sold or otherwise shared with advertisers, sponsors, partners or other 3 rd parties.** And under no circumstances is this information collected or distributed in any form without your prior knowledge and consent. 

The specifics of our Privacy Policy are best described in the answers to the following Frequently Asked Questions:

**Answers**

**Who will be able to view our private family Web site?**

Only those with a valid username and password have access to your site. Initially, the family site administrator (creator) will invite new members and assign a temporary username and password. As family members register, they may change their passwords to ensure complete security and privacy. It is then the responsibility of site members to help keep the site secure by offering password access only to appropriate relatives and friends – those they want to have access to the site. Each user is responsible to protect his or her username & password. In the future, MyFamily.com may provide "guest areas" so guests can view certain information without a username and password. 

**Does MyFamily.com ask for personal information?**

Yes. MyFamily.com asks for your name, email address, and other limited personal information when you sign up to create or participate in a family Web site and to use features such as e-mail, chat, personality profiles, and gift registries. Most of this information may be entered at your option. We may ask for similar information at other times, such as when you enter sweepstakes or other promotions sponsored by MyFamily.com and/or our partners. 

**How Does MyFamily.com use my personal information?**

Our goal is to provide you with the most personalized, relevant, user-friendly Web experience possible. The primary use of all your personal information is to share it with other family members and friends when they visit your site. 

MyFamily.com will also use registration and profile information to advise you of new members and new postings to the site, to let you know about new features or other offers of interest from MyFamily.com, or to address customer service needs and requests.

In order to make the site more relevant to you we also direct advertising from our sponsors according to the interests of our users. For instance, if you indicate an interest in cooking in your member profile, you may see an ad from Betty Crocker, while your brother, who likes sports might see an Adidas ad. Ultimately, this makes the service far more valuable to each family member. 

In distributing advertiser or sponsor messages, **the advertiser never has access to individual account information. MyFamily.com does not sell, rent or otherwise distribute the personal information you provide us.** Advertisers simply give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old, or 18-34 year olds interested in outdoor sports). MyFamily.com then displays the ad only to users who meet those criteria. 

**Does MyFamily.com request or require any personal financial information?**

MyFamily.com offers products and services for sale in our online store. To facilitate payment, MyFamily.com will request personal credit or debit card information. In order to take advantage of other value-added family services that may be offered by MyFamily.com in the future, users may be required to supply financial information.

**Will MyFamily.com disclose any of my personal information to third parties?**

No. MyFamily.com will _not_ disclose any of your personal information, except with your knowledge and consent as described below, or as may be required by law, or to protect the rights or property of MyFamily.com. 

Most personal information collected by MyFamily.com is made available only to other members of your family site, such as in the family address book or member profiles. Other circumstances where limited personal information may be disclosed are specifically described when the data is collected, such as in the User Agreement, or in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions. So in all cases you control what, if any information you make available 

MyFamily.com does reserve the right to disclose aggregated user statistics, such as "45% of our users are female" or "10,000 members indicate an interest in gardening" in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties. Under protection of confidentiality agreements, MyFamily.com may match common user information, such as name, address & phone number, with third party data to avoid duplication and prevent errors.

Additionally, if you click away from MyFamily.com to visit the site of any third party advertiser or sponsor, you may be asked for your credit card or other personal information in order purchase or use products and services offered. These companies have their own privacy and data collection practices. MyFamily.com has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should therefore review their privacy policies carefully if you have concerns about how your information may be used.

**Will MyFamily.com use my information for direct mailings?**

Only at your option. MyFamily.com can automatically send email messages to advise members when new information has been posted to the family Web site. Participating members may also send email to the entire family group or selected individuals, at their discretion. These options are user selectable. 

MyFamily.com may also occasionally send information about special product and service offerings that we feel may be of interest to you. Only MyFamily.com (or agents working on behalf of MyFamily.com under strict confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings, you may opt out at any time by deselecting that option in your user preferences. 

**May I refuse to provide personal information to MyFamily.com or to accept advertising?**

Yes on both counts. Most of the personal information provided to MyFamily.com may be offered at your own discretion and is intended for family use only. A username and e-mail address are all that are required to participate in the site. Naturally, withholding some personal information may compromise the usefulness of the site for other family members. Because the MyFamily.com site is advertiser supported, you may not "turn off" the advertising that appears on family Web site pages, but you may opt to be excluded from any email advertising.

**Does MyFamily.com use "IP Addresses" and cookies?**

__IP Addresses:__ We do use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members. 

__MyFamily.com Cookies:__ Contrary to popular myth, cookies do not extract private or personal information from your computer’s memory, but rather, record only information you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer the first time you visit our Web site that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are next time you come back. MyFamily.com does make limited use of cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. For instance they may be used to retain your personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping basket," or save your password so it doesn’t have to be re-entered each time you login.

__Advertiser Cookies:__ MyFamily.com does post third party advertising banners on personal family Web sites and on MyFamily.com general use pages. These ads may contain cookies used primarily to provide data to the advertiser about where visitors are coming from. While we do use cookies in other parts of our Web site as explained above, cookies received with banner ads may or may not be collected or controlled by our company.

__Intel Pentium III Processor Serial Number:__ MyFamily.com may use the processor serial number function as an additional, optional mechanism by which administrative control or access is granted. In addition to authenticating user name and password, MyFamily.com may offer its members the option of utilizing the processor serial number feature to provide additional security for accessing their sites.

**Are Chat room dialogues recorded and saved?**

Dialogues are not currently collected, stored, or used by the company or others. In the future, MyFamily.com may allow family/group site members to save chat sessions for their private use.

**What else should I know about privacy?**

The following encapsulates a few key issues mentioned in context above.

**Member Profiles**

Demographic and personality profile data is collected at our site at the users’ option. This information may include age and gender plus hobbies, interests, and other personal preferences that can be viewed by other family members who have access to the site. Some of this statistical demographic information may also be used on an aggregate basis to attract advertisers and to deliver offers and information to specific members, or to "customize" a visitor’s experience. In no case is this information given to a third party. MyFamily.com controls the distribution of ALL information at the site.

**Contests & Promotions **

MyFamily.com may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on our site in which we ask members or visitors for contact information (like an email address) or demographic information (like a zip code, age, or income level). We use this data to send users promotional material about our company or our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the terms and conditions specified when you take part in the promotion. At any time, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings of this kind, or simply decline to take part in the promotions. 

Opt-Out

Our site provides users the ability to opt-out of receiving direct advertising communications from our partners and sponsors. This option may be selected by any user on the "preferences" page. We always reserve the right to contact members about service or payment issues, new features to improve the service, etc.

_May I delete or deactivate my account and what happens to my personal information if I do?_

Yes you may. MyFamily.com gives users the following options for removing their information from our database or to no longer receive our service. 

  1. Individual family members may request that their personal data be deleted through their site Administrator. 

  2. Entire family groups may request that their site be removed and personal files deleted by following the instructions in the [FAQ](https://web.archive.org/FeedbackSupport.asp). 

  3. If a MyFamily.com Web site has no activity for at least 90 days 3 message will be sent to all members advising them that the site may be removed if there is no further activity. A final notice will be sent about a week prior to removal of the site.




Once information is deleted it is erased from the MyFamily.com servers and cannot be restored unless you have a backup. 

Change/Modify

This site gives users the following options for changing and modifying information previously provided.

  1. Any member may modify his/her personal information, including passwords at any time by logging in at the site, clicking on Family Info or Members, selecting his/her name and updating the information therein. 

  2. At any time, members may delete or modify information and items such as news, photos, sounds, or other files which they personally have posted to their site. A site’s administrator is able to delete and modify items submitted by members of the site.
