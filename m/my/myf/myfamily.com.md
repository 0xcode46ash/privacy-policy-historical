    * Your digital content and related titles, captions, and annotations

You will also be required to select a username and password.

If you are a Site Administrator or Member, you may be asked to submit to us limited personal information about other people. For example, if you want to invite someone to join your Family Web Site, you will be asked submit the invitee’s name and email address. In this circumstance, we collect the following information about the invitee only:

    * Name
    * Email address

Also, when you share Content from your Family Web Site, we collect the email addresses of the recipients of any Content you have elected to share with others. We will not disclose these email addresses to any third parties. (Please note, however, that these people will be able to forward your email to them containing the shared Content with other parties, if they choose.)

To personalize your experience on our Web site and to improve our products and services, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics and experiences with our products or services. Providing this additional information is optional. If you elect not to provide us with this information, there are no consequences to you as it regards your access to the Service.

From time to time, you may be invited to participate in optional customer surveys or contests, and we may request that you provide some or all of the above identified personal information in connection with those surveys or contests. We use information collected through contests to contact winners and award prizes. We use information collected from surveys to learn about our customers in order to improve our services and develop new products and services of interest to our customers.

  2. **Financial Information that you give us**

Certain portions of the Services are available only on a paid (continuous subscription) basis, and we also offer products and services for sale through our online store. To facilitate payment, among other things, we will request certain personal information from you, including your personal credit or debit card information.

When you subscribe to any of the paid portions of the Service, or when you make a purchase on our Web site, we will collect the following personal and financial information from you:

    * Name
    * Billing address
    * Shipping address
    * Phone number
    * Credit/debit card information

In addition to the personal information you may provide to us as described above, we do automatically collect non-personal information to make myfamily.com work better for you by evaluating how users and Members use our Web site. This non-personal information is not associated with your identity.

The technologies we use to gather this non-personal information include:

    * IP addresses
    * cookies
    * Web logs



### How We Use the Information We Collect:

  1. **How we use personal information that you give us**

Our goal is to provide you with the most personalized, relevant, user-friendly Web experience possible.

The personal information contained in any Content which you Post to the Service will obviously be shared with other family or friends who are invited to and are Members of your Private Family Web Site, or with other users who view your Public Family Web Site. The decision whether to designate your Family Web Site as a Private Family Web Site or a Public Family Web Site is always up to you. Likewise, your decision to post Content to any Web site is always up to you.

We will also use your email address and other Member registration information to advise you of new Members and new postings to your Family Web Site, to let you know about new features or other offers of interest from us or our affiliates or to address customer service needs and requests.

We currently don't allow children 13 or under to register for MyFamily.com 2.0 beta. So we ask everyone who signs up to certify that they're over the age of 13 by entering their birth date and accepting our terms and conditions.

In order to make site more relevant to you we also direct advertising from our sponsors according to the interests of our users. For instance, if you indicate an interest in cooking in your member profile, you may see an ad from Betty Crocker, while your brother, who likes sports, might see an Adidas ad. Ultimately, this makes the service far more valuable to each family member.

In distributing advertiser or sponsor messages, **the advertiser never has access to individual account information. We do not sell, rent or otherwise distribute the personal information you provide us for use by third parties for their use.** Advertisers simply give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old, or 18-34 year olds interested in outdoor sports). We then display the ad only to users who meet those criteria.

  2. **How we use financial information that you give us**

The financial information you share with us is used by us in connection with processing your orders, and the payments made in respect of those orders, only, and for no other purposes. We will store the financial information you provide us initially (subject to your changes over time) in secure databases so that you may easily access it for future purchases. For our continuous subscription services which renew automatically, we use the financial information that we have on file for you to automatically process your payment on the payment due date.

If you have provided us with your financial information in connection with any products you have ordered or services which were rendered on our through our Web site, you may access that information with your username and password in order to make updates or changes to the information.

  3. **How we use information we collect automatically**

**IP Addresses:** IP addresses define the Internet location of computers, and help us better understand the geographic distribution of our members and manage the performance of our website. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members.
