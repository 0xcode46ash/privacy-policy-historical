### General Data Collection

When you browse one of our websites we record standard details of your visit in our administration databases and our web server log files. This information is held for statistical and administration purposes only and is collected in a way which does not identify you. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of our website. We will not associate any data gathered from this site with any personally identifying information from any source. The data collected includes:

  * your IP (Internet Protocol) address;
  * the pages you access and any documents downloaded from our website;
  * where applicable and available, the previous website you visited and the search query you used to reach our website;

Telephone calls may be recorded for training and security purposes.

We may collect and store personal information that you choose to give us via online forms, by telephone or by email. For example if you:

  * subscribe to one of our newsletters
  * participate in an online survey / opinion poll

If we receive your email address because you send us a message, your email address will only be used or disclosed for the purpose for which it has been provided and it will not be added to a mailing list or used or disclosed for any other purpose without the your consent.

If you give us personal information about another person, in doing so you confirm that they have given you permission to provide it to us, and that you have told them who we are and what we will use their data for, as set out in this privacy policy. We only use personal information collected via our websites for the purposes for which it was given to us.

### Making a Purchase

If you decide to purchase insurance from us, we will request and store information relevant to the purchase, such as your name, address, postcode, date of birth, email address, telephone numbers, gender and any other relevant details. This information will only be used for the purposes of arranging your insurance cover - e.g. we would only use the telephone number to communicate or discuss a problem with arranging the policy or providing cover. 

_Please note: For online purchases we do not collect or store any debit or credit card details. Such information is taken and processed by our payment service provider and we therefore take no responsibility for such information. For offline purchases, any debit or credit card details taken will be destroyed immediately after use._

### Electronic Data Storage and Security

By submitting your personal information, you agree that when necessary we may disclose your information to our insurance providers and their agents and service providers, some of which may be located outside the European Economic Area in countries providing less protection for personal data than the UK.

Whilst we take every reasonable precaution to keep your personal information secure, you should be aware that any communications over the internet, such as e-mails, are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Any personal information submitted to us may route through a number of countries before being delivered - this is the nature of the internet. We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.

Any personal information provided to us will be stored on password protected databases. Calls may be recorded for training and security purposes and any recordings will be stored on password protected databases.

Staff members associated with the maintenance of this website will have access to administration files and databases which are password protected. Our website server, hosted by our internet service provider, is also password protected.

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete, up-to-date and stored in a secure environment protected from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

### Non-Electronic Data Storage and Security

Any personal data that is collected by us which is not stored electronically will be either immediately destroyed after use, or stored in a secure location protected from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

### Information used for Marketing Purposes

When relevant we may use your contact information to send out promotional material relating to our products and to send out information about our company. We may also use your email address to contact you on the same date each year to offer a new quotation, based on the information that you have already submitted to us. We may also occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to this website, new services and special offers by mail, telephone, SMS, or email to provide information that we think you will find valuable. You may opt-out of receiving future notifications by emailing us, or sending a message on our Contact Us form. Occasionally, we may also allow other very carefully selected companies to offer related products or services to you by mail, telephone, SMS, or email. If you do not wish to receive information of this kind you can opt-out of marketing when completing a purchase, by sending us an email, or via our 'Contact Us' page.

### Information used for Customer Feedback

All customers who either purchase insurance from us or subsequently contact our customer services department may receive an automated email from our feedback system services provider feeefo.com. Customer feedback is an important tool for us to understand how we are performing. The feedback service is integral to the operation of our website and it is not possible to opt-out of this service when you make a purchase. If you do not agree to this you should not continue with your purchase. After you have purchased you may opt out of receiving emails from feefo.com by using the feefo opt out link at the bottom of their email, by sending us an email, or via our 'Contact Us' page. 

### Disclosure of Personal Information

We may share any personal information supplied to us if one or more of the following applies:

  * you have consented
  * if required to do so by any court, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Office of Fair Trading or any other applicable quasi-governmental law enforcement organisation or quasi-autonomous non-governmental law enforcement organisation ; and/or
  * if required or permitted to do so by a law enforcement agency; and/or
  * if required in connection with legal proceedings or potential legal proceedings; and/or
  * if ownership of the website is transferred in part or full, in which case any new owner would only be permitted to use that information in a way prescribed by this Privacy Policy.
  * it will prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to somebody's life or health



### Information Exchange

We exchange information with other approved organisations, such as insurance providers, for underwriting, claims and fraud prevention purposes. Your insurance provider may also need to share your information for the administration and management of your policy. In addition, in the course of using information in normal business practices such as data backup, banking and professional advisers, we may disclose information to other parties where this is required or permitted by law and by any relevant data protection legislation.

Insurance providers may exchange information through a number of different databases, including the Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE), which holds a record of incidents reported to insurers by policyholders and third party claimants. This exchange of information enables the insurers to validate the information you provide, both about yourself and any other named person within the application, and aims to reduce insurance fraud.

If you are a Smartgo Promotional Code user you agree to Eversure Insurance passing your name, email address and your name of organisation to Go Travel Solutions Limited (â€˜Smartgoâ€™) in order that your entitlement to the promotion may be validated. This information will be used for no other purposes.

### Data Access and Correction

We will maintain and update personal information collected from our websites as necessary or when we are advised by users that their personal information has changed. In order to comply with data protection legislation, it is our policy to only deal with the person named on our database. Unless you instruct us otherwise, we will not deal with any other party, other than in extreme and exceptional circumstances.

### Viewing Your Data
