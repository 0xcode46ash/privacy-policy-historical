# PeopleString

**BigString is committed to respecting your privacy. Our self-destructing email, IM and messaging products can better help you protect your and your recipients' privacy. We recognize your need for control of personally identifiable information that you share with BigString. Personally identifiable information is information that only pertains to you as an individual such as your name, address, phone number or credit card number. BigString does not collect sensitive information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals.**

**SECURITY**

In addition to providing you with secure email, IM and messaging products, BigString uses a Thawte ([http://www.thawte.com](http://www.thawte.com/)) digitally signed certificate to process all sensitive information securely through SSL encryption. This encryption is used during the registration process, credit card processing, and user login.

**REGISTRATION**

In order to use this Web site, you must first register for an account with BigString. The user account name that you create will be used as your Screen name. A password must be created that contains at minimum six (6) characters. Your gender, date of birth, email address, country of residence and zip code/mail code are required as well. For email accounts, your first name, last name and alternative email address are also required.

If you are signing up for any of BigString's paid accounts you will be required to enter your credit card type, card number, CCID number, expiration date of your card, your name as it appears on your account and the billing address on your account. Please note, for your safety, we do not maintain any data from your credit card submission. We use [authorize.net](http://authorize.net/) to process your payment. Your credit card debit will show as a charge from either Email Emissary Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of BigString Corp) or Bigstring.com. Your data is sent to a third party credit card processor such as [authorize.net](http://authorize.net/) for credit card processing. The credit card processor is prohibited from using any personally identifiable information for any other purpose than for payment processing. You will be returned to the BigString site on successful completion to learn more about your new account and begin using it.

From time to time BigString may offer coupons to new users that are not normally available to BigString users. At these times a coupon code or a referrer address may be required to obtain these additional features. At no time will the referrer address be stored and used for marketing purposes by BigString.
