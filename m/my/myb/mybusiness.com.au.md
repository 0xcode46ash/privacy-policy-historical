# Privacy Policy - My Business

This Privacy Policy sets out the approach which SME Media will take in relation to the treatment of Personal Information. It includes information on how SME Media collects, uses, discloses and keeps secure, individuals’ personal information. It also covers how SME Media makes the personal information it holds available for access to and correction by the individual.

This policy has been drafted having regard to SME Media’s  obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (including the National Privacy Principles) (the Privacy Act).

This policy is a public document and has been prepared in light of National Privacy Principle 5, Openness.

**1\. Collection**

1.1 SME MEDIA will only collect Personal Information where the information is necessary for SME MEDIA to perform one or more of its functions or activities. In this context, “collect” means gather, acquire or obtain by any means, information in circumstances where the individual is identifiable or identified.

1.2 SME MEDIA collects Personal Information primarily to supply employees of member organisations and individuals who obtain SME MEDIA products and services directly from SME MEDIA with information and details of it’s products and services. SME MEDIA also collects and uses Personal Information for secondary purposes including:

1   provision of products and services;

2   accounting purposes;

3   business planning and product development.

1.3 SME MEDIA will notify individuals (including, but not limited to, our customers) of the matters listed below at the time of collecting any Personal Information:

1   the main reason that we are collecting Personal Information (this reason will be the Primary Purpose);

2   other related Uses or Disclosures that we may make of the Personal Information(Secondary Purposes);

3   our identity and how individuals can contact us, if this is not obvious;

4   that individuals can access the Personal Information that SME MEDIA holds about them;

6   the organisations or types of organisations to whom we usually Disclose the Personal Information;

7   where applicable, any law that requires the Personal Information to be collected;

8   the consequences (if any) for the individual if all or part of the Personal Information is not provided to SME MEDIA.

1.4 Where it is not practicable for SME MEDIA to notify individuals of all of the Collection Information before the collection of Personal Information, SME MEDIA will ensure that individuals are notified of the Collection Information as soon as possible after the collection. SME MEDIA will provide “post collection notification” in those circumstances where it is not practicable to notify individuals about the collection of their personal information before it is collected.

1.5 SME MEDIA will not collect Sensitive Information from individuals except with express consent from the individual and only where it is necessary for SME MEDIA to collect such information for an activity or function.
