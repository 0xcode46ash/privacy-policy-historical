# my Bittorrent - Privacy

myBittorrent.com does **not** record personal information.

Where identification is required for purposes of administration and/or user login, we use an encrypted string based on your username and password which are then encoded using our own secret algorithm. Such string is used solely by myBittorrent.com and cannot be decoded.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on myBittorrent.com. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please consult the privacy policy of the advertiser concerned. This policy can be found on the advertiser's website.

In the course of serving advertisements, our third-party advertisers may place an unique "cookie" on your browser. Such cookie is encrypted and also contains no personal information.

This policy is in effect since _26 July 2007_.

NOTE: We noticed that other sites, such as TorrentSpy.com, copied our privacy policy. We don't mind, because we know that we are a leading Torrent Website and others are not creative enough to make a policy themselves. Also note that we are one of the few websites who does NOT secretly record personal information.
