**Information Collection, Use, and Sharing**

Personal Information

We use the term “ **Personal Information** ” to mean any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including your name, address, e-mail address, birth date, financial account information, or any combination of information that could be used to identify you.  We only have access to/collect personal information that you voluntarily give us via our website, store transactions, email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.

We may provide the ability for you to submit photos to us through our website.  For example, we may allow you to submit a photo of goods that were delivered damaged in order to obtain an exchange.  If you submit photos via our website, we will only use the photo(s) for the purpose of processing your request.  It is your responsibility to ensure that the photo(s) you submit do not include images of any individuals or other identifying information.

We will use your personal information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your personal information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order, or activate your Goof Proof Plus Protection Plan.

Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

**Your Access to and Control Over Personal Information**

You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time.  You can opt out of future email communications by clicking the “unsubscribe” link available on every email or you can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number given on our website:

1\. See what data we have about you, if any.

2\. Change/correct any data we have about you.

3\. Have us delete any data we have about you.

4\. Express any concern you have about our use of your data.

**Anonymous Information**

We use the term " **Activities Information** " to refer to information collected by so-called "persistent identifiers" such as cookies and web beacons.  Unlike Personal Information, Activities Information does not directly identify a particular person; the Information, however, is or can potentially be linked to a particular computer or device. 

We use the term “ **Aggregated Statistics** ” to mean information that does not identify you and that is not linkable to a device or computer you use.  Aggregated Statistics includes statistical information concerning, for example, (i) how users generally use our website, and (ii) which pages they visit most frequently.

We and certain service providers operating on our behalf collect Activities Information about your activity on our Site.  In addition, advertisers and other third parties might collect Activities Information via our Site. 

A cookie is a small amount of data that often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.  Cookies can be used to provide a tailored user experience and to make it easier to use a website upon a future visit.  We may include cookies on our Website and use them to recognize you when you return to our Site.  Service providers that collect Activities Information on our behalf may provide an opportunity for you to choose not to be tracked online.  In addition, other third-party websites may recognize our cookies stored on your computer, and use that information to provide you with information related to the content of our Website.  You may set your browser so that it does not accept cookies, though cookies must be enabled on your web browser if you wish to access certain personalized features of our Site.

Our Site may include the use of ad banner partners for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages.  These ads may be provided, in some cases, by a third party ad service provider or advertiser (collectively, " **Advertisers** ").  Additionally, advertisers may place or utilize their own cookies on your browser and may use Activities Information about your visit to our Site.  If an Advertiser requests that you provide Personal Information to it, please be aware that the Advertiser's use and collection of this information will be governed by its privacy policy, and not our Privacy Policy.  We recommend that you review the Advertiser's privacy policy before providing Personal Information.  You may choose not to receive targeted advertising from certain ad networks, data exchanges, marketing analytics and other service providers as indicated at:  http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ 

We use Aggregated Statistics to analyze the effectiveness of our Site, to improve our Website, products, services, and for other purposes.  This information provides us with potentially useful data concerning our users' preferences and the efficacy and interest of our Site, products and services.  In addition, we may undertake or commission statistical and other summary analyses of the general behavior and characteristics of Website users, and the use of our Website and related services, and may share Aggregated Statistics with third parties, including advertisers (if any).  Rest assured that Aggregated Statistics provided to third parties will not allow anyone to identify you.  We may collect Aggregated Statistics through features of the software supporting our Website through both the means described below and other means.

If we combine Activities Information or Aggregated Statistics with Personal Information, we will treat the combination as Personal Information under this policy.

**Security**

We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your personal information is protected both online and offline.

Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone at 1-800-723-BOBS or via email.
