### Testimonials

"They did a great job of helping us find our new house and an even better job of selling our old house. They stayed within the parameters we had set for our new house, showing only those properties or neighborhoods that met our requirements. They kept us realistic about what we could expect to pay to get what we wanted in a home and local amenities, so we ended up adjusting along the way. When selling our house, they were very knowledgeable about recent sales in our area, along with concessions made for those sales, which helped us set a realistic price and expectations for our sale. They took very good photographs of our house for the listing and made sure our listing had online visibility. When moving, they also provided a list of vendors we could use to either prepare our house for sale, or to assist in getting the new house personalized. They kept us apprised of status and action items all along the way. All communications were timely and detailed, and they were fun and easy to work with. I would definitely recommend this team and would use them again, should the need arise."
