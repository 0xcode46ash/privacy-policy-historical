### Testimonials

"I offer the unique perspective of working extensively with The Sanders Team as a Lending partner for their clients. I can tell you with all sincerity........Michelle, Greg, Tess, and the whole team are just amazing. Since I work with them behind the scenes on their transactions, I have the "inside scoop" and can tell any prospective client that they are TRULY the utmost Professionals. Their experience, knowledge, work ethic, and care/dedication to their clients IS the reality and I know this first-hand from the side that Buyers/Sellers don't typically see, as opposed to some Realtors who may show good "salesmanship" in person, but don't truly prove it with how they operate behind the scenes. The Team has their processes down and does not miss any details, and nothing slips through the cracks. Most importantly to me, they have a great understanding of the needs/requirements on the financing side as well. As we all know, the vast majority of all homebuyers don't have 100% cash and need a mortgage to buy their home, and obviously NO transactions would ever close without a successful mortgage process. Thus, it's crucial - - as a lender - - to work with Realtors that are equally responsive and dedicated to providing all needs for the mortgage side of the process so that the transaction can be a success, and this is also something The Sanders Team is excellent about. It makes our job as lenders so much easier, which means the financing side of the process also goes all-the-smoother for their clients. Aside from everything above, everyone on the team is extremely personable, easy to get along with, trustworthy, and family-oriented. So I HIGHLY endorse the Team for any needs at all, whether you are a Buyer, Seller, or BOTH!"
