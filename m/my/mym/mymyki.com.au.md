# Privacy Statement

The TTA understands and respects your right to privacy and is committed to privacy protection. As a State-Owned Enterprise subject to the Information Privacy Act 2000, TTA has developed a Privacy Policy to regulate the way that it collects and handles your personal information. This privacy statement outlines how your privacy is protected and how TTA manages information it collects from visitors to this website [TTA Privacy Policy](http://www.myki.com.au/ArticleDocuments/167/myki%20Privacy%20Policy%20January%202013.pdf.aspx).

 **What information is currently collected through this website?**

You can access this website and browse anonymously without providing your personal information and without being identified. TTA collects data through its web server, including the number, time and date of visits to the site and its pages. This anonymous information is used for statistical purposes and to ensure our website is providing relevant information.

Some functions and services provided by this website require you to provide certain personal information. For example, if you are seeking additional information on myki, we will need contact details in order to respond. A Privacy Notice is provided wherever personal information is collected.

 **Cookies**

This website uses cookies to track user traffic patterns so that we can improve this site. A cookie is a small data file that is shared between a web server and your browser and which may be stored on your hard drive. Cookies can provide various types of information, depending on how they are used. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie so that you can accept or reject it. However, rejecting cookies may limit how you can use this site.

 **Privacy and myki**

myki smart cards will be used for travel on metropolitan trains, trams and buses as well as on selected regional trains and buses. Most myki cardholders will have the choice of purchasing and using an unregistered myki. **Personal information will be collected if a customer chooses to do any of the following things:**

 **Registering a myki**

Registration will require at least minimum contact details, for some concession cardholders it is mandatory to register and personalise their card (with name, or name and photo), dependent on the category of concession entitlement. Registered cardholders can choose to personalise their myki with their name if this is requested at the time of purchase.

Personal information provided by or about the account holder or cardholder or generated by using the Card is collected by Public Transport Authorities (TTA, Public Transport Victoria, the Department of Transport and their contractors, agents and delegates including public transport operators) to issue and administer the Card and relevant entitlements. The account holder or cardholder will generally be able to access his/her personal information. The TTA requires personal information to provide the Card and related services, such as registration.

 **Setting auto topup**

If you choose to register for auto top up (a direct debit facility from your credit card or bank account). The TTA will need to hold relevant details required for payment processing.

 **Topping up by credit or debit card**

If you choose to add value to your anonymous myki by using a credit or debit card, your credit card details are provided to TTA's bank and not retained by TTA.

 **Ordering an anonymous myki via the myki website or myki call centre**

If you order an anonymous myki via the website or call centre, your contact details will be required temporarily to issue the myki. These details will be deleted approximately 30 days after the myki is mailed to you.

 **Making a query or complaint**

The TTA may require personal information (contact details) in order to respond to queries or complaints.

 **Using the myki**

Use of the myki will generate a record, which will include the location, time and date of the transaction. If a cardholder has provided personal details, the TTA will have the ability to link these with card holder's transactions. However, TTA or its agents will not normally need to do so in connection with the operation of the payment system.  
Personal information held by Public Transport Authorities may be used or disclosed (including to each other) for the operation of myki; to verify entitlement to concession travel; for ticketing enforcement; in emergencies; otherwise as required or authorised by or under law; or with your consent. The full Privacy Policy explains these circumstances. [TTA Privacy Policy](http://www.myki.com.au/ArticleDocuments/167/myki%20Privacy%20Policy%20January%202013.pdf.aspx)
