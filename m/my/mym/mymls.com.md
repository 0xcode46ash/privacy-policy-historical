# Metrolist, Inc.

**Effective: May 18, 2005**

At Metrolist, Inc, we are fully committed to the protection and security of any information you provide to us as our members and as visitors to our website. We want you to know that we truly respect and will protect your privacy, so you can enjoy using our services which allow us to better serve your needs.

Our Privacy Policy discloses our approach to privacy and how your personal information is collected and used. Your use of our website constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and your consent to the practices it describes.

**What Information We Collect**

Generally speaking, our website is informational. Your "personally identifiable information", that is, information about you as an individual which would permit someone to contact you, is only requested by Metrolist in order for us to send you information such as our newsletter, to enable us to provide search functionality and to provide the various real estate professional management tools we offer to assist you in your business. We do not collect any personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it.

As is the case when you visit most websites, to administer our site, your visit triggers the automatic logging of certain anonymous information about your computer system such as the type of browser you use, the server name and your "IP" (Internet Protocol) address. When your web browser or email application requests a web page or email from another computer using the Internet, it automatically gives that computer your computer's "address" so it knows where it should send the information. This is called your computer's "IP address." This anonymous information does not contain any personally identifiable information about you.

**How We Protect Your Information**

We protect the confidentiality and security of any personal information we may have by using industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls, coupled with carefully developed security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration.

Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information and, using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, we restrict access to any sensitive personal information to those employees and agents for business purposes only. Additionally, we use internal and external resources to frequently review the adequacy of our security procedures. You need to know, however, that due to the open communication nature of the Internet we cannot guarantee that communication between you and us, and between us and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties nor can we be responsible for information stolen from our servers by information harvesting software which may have the ability to scrape data.

**How We Use Your Information**

When we ask you for information, we tell you, or it will be clear, why we need any personally identifying information from you either to fulfill a request from you or to provide information or services to you.

**We Do Not Sell Or Rent Your Personal Information**

Aside from our own use of your personal information, we do not share any personal information we may have about you with third parties for promotional use without your consent. Also, you control what marketing information you receive from us, by simply letting us know if you wish to opt out and not receive information from us.

We may, however, have to disclose, transfer, sell or assign your information obtained through this website, or otherwise in our possession, to a third party as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation of Metrolist. We may also have to make information obtained through this website, or otherwise in our possession, available to law enforcement personnel and agencies when requested to do so or as required by law.

**We Want To Provide Only Information You Want**

At any time, you may let us know whether or not you want to continue to receive information from us. If you do not wish to receive information from us, you can specify your preference by emailing us at [privacy@metrolist.com](mailto:privacy@metrolist.com).

**Cookie Technology**

Cookie technology is employed when you access our site. For our members it is part of the authentication process when you enter your User Name and Password. For our visitors it helps us keep track of the pages you visit while on our website. "Cookies" are small text files sent by Web servers to be stored on the computers of website users. These files often contain personalization settings or unique identifiers to keep track of your information and to help us understand the movements of users within and between websites.

**Privacy Statement Changes**

We reserve the right to change or amend our Privacy Policy to address new issues of privacy and information security and to reflect changes to our website or business practices. Any new changes and/or amendments will be noted on our Home Page and will always be posted in this section of the Metrolist website.

**Questions About Our Privacy And Information Security Practices?**

Your visit to this site is subject to both this notice and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes and application of the law of the State of Colorado.

If you have any questions about our privacy practices or procedures, please feel free to email us at [privacy@metrolist.com](mailto:privacy@metrolist.com). We will promptly address your inquiry.
