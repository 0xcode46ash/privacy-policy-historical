Your Internet Privacy  
Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Because we gather certain types of information about the users of the Medi-Share website, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy policy (this "Statement") discloses the privacy practices for Medi-Share.org (the "Website")—what information we gather, how we use it and how to correct or change it. This Statement only addresses our activities from our servers. Questions regarding this Statement should be emailed to [privacy@medi-share.org](mailto:privacy@medi-share.org)

General Privacy Information  
Medi-Share.org contains links to e-Commerce and other services that may also collect data. The same privacy and data collection practices will apply. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information on any online service or Website—for example on message boards, through e-Mail, or in chat areas—that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Further, while we strive to protect your personal information, Medi-Share.org cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.

Use of Information  
All of the information Medi-Share.org collects, both what you tell us and what we collect through the use of cookies, is not "aggregated" -- meaning that the information from individual users is not grouped together in a way that discloses the personal information of any particular user. We may use this non-aggregated information to evaluate which ministry programs are successful and which ones are not, and in order to evaluate which new options we should make available on our Websites. We may use only the anonymous click stream data to help understand and deliver better-targeted information. Medi-Share.org will not disclose any information about any individual without the individual's consent, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process. There may be cases in which some of your personal information may be used by Medi-Share.org to target e-Commerce promotions and telemarketing activities. In addition, it may be shared with Third Parties who assist Medi-Share.org in producing its Website or provide a service to Medi-Share.org’s members.

If you have any questions about this Statement, the practices of Medi-Share.org with respect to personal information or your dealings with this Website, please Contact Us.

Registration  
Anyone who participates in product purchases or the membership program on the Medi-Share.org Website may be asked to register for a free ID and passcode or to complete subscription registration for a member ID and password. We use member contact information from this registration form to send the user information about the ministry.

The member contact information is also used to contact the member when necessary for member service. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings by Contacting Us, or by following the simple instructions at the bottom of each email. Unique identifiers, such as ID and passwords, are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system.

Children Under the Age of 13  
Medi-Share.org will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (is U.S.C. 6501 et seq.). However, personally identifiable information regarding your child is requested from you, as a parent, for use only on the Application Form. Children of any age should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online.

Cookies  
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. This random number lets us keep track of "how many" times members are doing specific things—like visiting our site each month—without really knowing who those members are. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your member ID. 

Additionally, after you've entered your member ID and passcode during a session on our service, we save that information so you don't have to reenter it repeatedly during that session.

Users should be aware that Medi-Share.org cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by third parties hosting data for Medi-Share.org. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that cookies maybe necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the Medi-Share.org Website.

Order Forms  
The Medi-Share.org Website uses an order form for members to purchase products and services. If you place an order at a store, or on an application hosted by Medi-Share.org, we will collect information from you, including your credit card and contact information. This information will be used by the merchant to bill the user for products and services. Contact information from the order form will also be used to ship orders, to contact a user for member service related issues, and to send the user information about our company, and on occasion, promotional material from some of our partners. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings by Contacting Us, or by following the simple instructions at the bottom of each e-Mail.

Newsletters  
Members may cancel their free email subscriptions to newsletters by following the simple instructions at the bottom of each newsletter or email.

Security  
Medi-Share.org utilizes a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. All contact information is contained behind a "firewall" and only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to production systems. 

Passwords and credit card numbers are encrypted in Medi-Share’s secure database, which is also located behind a firewall. All sensitive/credit information supplied by users is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer  
(SSL) technology and then encrypted in Medi-Share’s databases as stated above.

If you have forgotten your passcode, you may contact a member service representative at 800-264-2562. You will be asked to provide your name and then verify certain non-sensitive information (i.e. mother's maiden name) in order to proceed. Credit card information has been encrypted, and is completely invisible to most employees who access it, including our member service team.
