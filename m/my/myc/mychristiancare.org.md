# Christian Care ministry privacy policy

Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to Christian Care Ministry (CCM). Because certain types of information are gathered about the users of the Christian Care Ministry website, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy policy (referred to hereafter as "Statement") discloses the privacy practices for MyChristianCare.org (referred to hereafter as "Website") what information is gathered, how it is used and how to correct or change it. This Statement only addresses activities from the servers. Questions regarding this Statement should be emailed to memberservices@mychristiancare.org. 

**General Privacy Information**   
MyChristianCare.org contains links to e-Commerce and other services that may also collect data. The same privacy and data collection practices will apply. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information on any online service or Website—for example on message boards, through e-Mail, or in chat areas—that information can be collected and used by others. Information about visitors to the site who request information about CCM is housed and managed by a third party who may forward that information to other third parties for their use. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Further, while CCM strives to protect your personal information, it cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to CCM, and you do so at your own risk. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. 

**Use of Information**   
All of the information CCM collects, including what you convey via the site to CCM and what CCM collects through the use of cookies, is not "aggregated" -- meaning that the information from individual users is not grouped together in a way that discloses the personal information of any particular user. This non-aggregated information may be used to evaluate which ministry programs are successful and which ones are not, and in order to evaluate which new options should be available on the CCM Websites. To help understand and deliver better-targeted information only the anonymous click stream data will be used. CCM will not disclose any information about any individual without the individual's consent, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process. There may be cases in which some of your personal information may be used by CCM to target e-Commerce promotions and telemarketing activities. In addition, it may be shared with Third Parties who assist CCM in producing its Website or provide a service to CCM members. 

**Contact Us**   
If you have any questions about this Statement, the practices of CCM with respect to personal information or other issues regarding the website, please contact Christian Care Ministry. 

**Registration  
** To access program information at MyChristianCare.org, users will be asked to register a username and password. The contact information from this registration may be used to send the user information regarding CCM and other CCM programs. 

The contact information is also used to contact the participant when necessary to provide service. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings by Contacting Us , or by following the simple instructions at the bottom of each email. Unique identifiers, such as ID and passwords, are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in the record system. 

**Children Under the Age of 13**   
CCM will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (is U.S.C. 6501 et seq.). However, personally identifiable information regarding your child is requested from you, as a parent, for use only on the Application Form. Children of any age should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online. 

**Cookies  
** A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. This random number, helps CCM keep track of how many times participants are doing specific things—like visiting the website each month—without really knowing who those participants are. Cookies are used to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your CCM ID. 

Additionally, after you've entered your ID and password during a session the information is saved so you don't have to reenter it repeatedly during that session. 

Users should be aware that CCM cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by third parties hosting data for CCM. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that cookies maybe necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the Website. 

**Online Applications  
** The Website uses an online application that requires personal information from you, including your credit card and contact information. The credit card information will be used by CCM one time only, to process your application. However, the personal contact information may be used to establish your participant record and will be kept in the database. 

**Newsletters  
** Participants may cancel their free email subscriptions to newsletters by following the simple instructions at the bottom of each newsletter or email. 

**Security**   
CCM utilizes a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. All contact information is contained behind a "firewall" and only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to this information. 

Passwords and credit card numbers are encrypted in CCM’s secure database, which is also located behind a firewall. All sensitive/credit information supplied by users is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted in CCM’s databases as stated above. 

If you have forgotten your password, you may contact a Member Service Representative at 800-264-2562. You will be asked to provide your name and then verify certain non-sensitive information (i.e. mother's maiden name) in order to proceed. Credit card information has been encrypted, and is completely invisible to most employees who access it, including our Member Services team. 

**Information Sharing With Third Parties**  
From time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not operated by Christian Care Ministry to provide additional features at this website. These special relationships may include "powered by" partners, business partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as "co-branded pages"). You should look for a specific privacy statement on any such co-branded page. Any personal information that you provide when signing up at one of those co-branded pages may be shared with our third party partner. You should also check our partner's website for information regarding its privacy policies. 

Also, the nature of some features of our site may require that we share personal information about you with persons or companies outside of Christian Care Ministry. For example, this may occur at a feature that enables you, via our site, to ask questions of persons or entities that are not part of Christian Care Ministry. By responding to those features of the site, whether by email or direct entry of information on our website, you are consenting to our transferring that information to such persons or entities. 

**Public Forums**   
This site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its members. Any information you disclose in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. We cannot safeguard the privacy of any such information you choose to disclose online in this manner and you should do so carefully and at your own risk. Please refer to the Prayer Stream Policy for additional information about the terms of service applicable to CCM’s Prayer Stream.
