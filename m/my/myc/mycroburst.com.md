We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information. 

**2\. Collection of personal information**

To serve you better and understand your needs and interests, Guru collects, exports, and uses personal information with adequate notice and consent, along with required filings with data protection authorities, when applicable. For example, when you order products or services, request information, subscribe to marketing or support materials, register yourself or your Guru products, enter contests or participate in surveys, or apply for a job at Guru, we will ask you to provide personal information to complete these transactions. The types of personal information you provide to us on these pages may include contact information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address; financial information such as your credit card number; and other unique information such as user IDs and passwords, billing and transaction information, product and service preferences, contact preferences, educational and employment background, and job interest data.

If you choose to use a tell-a-friend program on our site, we will ask you for your friend's e-mail address and automatically send your friend a one-time e-mail inviting your friend to visit the site. Guru uses and stores this information only for the purpose of sending this one-time e-mail and to provide tell-a-friend message blocking, where available. 

In addition to the information you provide, Guru may also collect information during your visit to an Guru website through our Automatic Data Collection Tools, which include Web beacons, cookies, embedded Web links, and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at an Guru website. They may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, click stream behavior (i.e. the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with LDG websites) and product information. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers use IP addresses to communicate on the Internet, allowing users to browse and shop.

Credit card information and other sensitive personal information required to process a credit decision is not used for any other purpose by our financial services providers or Guru and will not be kept longer than necessary for providing the services, unless you ask us to retain your credit card information for future purchases.. 

**4\. How we share your information**

Guru will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others except as described in this Statement. Guru shares personal information in the following ways: 

Guru retains service providers and suppliers to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions and to assist Guru with marketing and communication initiatives. These providers and suppliers include, for example, credit card processors, providers of customer support and live-help, email service providers, automated data processors, and shipping agents. Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information received on behalf of Guru and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Guru. 

From time to time, Guru participates in marketing initiatives with other companies. As part of these initiatives, certain Guru services and marketing communications are delivered at the same time as those from other companies. Some of these services and communications offer you the option to share personal information with both Guru and the other companies participating in these initiatives. For example, you may receive marketing communications from Guru and other companies or have the opportunity to register online for software products from multiple companies. If you choose to provide personal information only to Guru, Guru will not share this information with the other companies participating in that marketing initiative. If you choose to provide personal information to the other companies, that personal information will be handled according to the privacy policy of those companies. 

Guru will require the export of your personal information to other Guru -owned business entities in the US and Worldwide in accordance with this Statement to satisfy your request. Such export is a requirement of providing the information to Guru. 

Except as described in this Statement, Guru will not share the personal information you provide to Guru with non- Guru third parties without your permission, unless to: (i) respond to duly authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities; (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order; (iii) help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights and properties of Guru or its subsidiaries; or (iv) protect the personal safety of Guru employees and third parties on Guru property. 

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Guru decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is Guru's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.

Keeping your personal information secure

When collecting or transferring sensitive information such as credit card information we use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The personal information you provide us is stored on computer systems located in controlled facilities which have limited access. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as credit card number or password) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
