Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to me. Accordingly, I have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how the site collects, uses, communicates, discloses and makes use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy. Coupon Teacher may use cookies to store information about visitors’ preferences or other information that visitors send via their browser. Some of my advertising partners may use cookies and web beacons on my site. My some of my advertising partners include Lijit and [Coupons.com](http://www.mycouponteacher.com/coupons-deals/samples). These third-party ad servers or ad networks sponsor advertisements and links on Coupon Teacher that are sent directly to your browsers. They automatically receive your IP address when this occurs. Other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) may also be used by the third-party ad networks to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and/or to personalize the advertising content that you see. Personally, I have no access to or control over these cookies that are used by third-party advertisers, although I strive to only work with companies that are dedicated to serving you.

Collection of Personal Information for Giveaways

There are occasions when I will ask for personal information, such as when you enter a giveaway. In these cases, I will only collect information (such as name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address) that you voluntarily provide via email. I will not sell or exchange your personal information at any time. I do use Google Analytics which collects general information (such as the type of browser you use, the files you request, and the domain name and country from which you request information) to better understand my readers. While Coupon Teacher is highly selective about which sites we provide links to, I do not control these web sites, nor do I endorse or otherwise accept responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those sites.
