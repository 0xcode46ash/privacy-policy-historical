  * When you contact us, to manage your requests, questions and communications; and
  * To comply with laws, regulations and legislation, and enforcement of our judicial rights.



We need to use your personal data for the above-mentioned purposes in order to comply with the law, fulfil your reservation, and otherwise to provide the services or customer support that you request.

Please note that if you make a reservation for individuals other than yourself, it is your responsibility to ensure that you comply with the Privacy Law in respect of your submission to us of their personal information.

We are not in the business of selling or renting personal data. We will not share your personal data, except with your consent, as otherwise required by law or as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement.

We pass this information to third parties for the purposes identified above in section 2 and always in accordance with applicable privacy laws. We may pass or share your personal data:

  * With affiliated and unaffiliated technical and organisational service providers relevant to our business. In this regard, for services functional to information management systems, management of the Site and customer support, we revert to Groupon, Inc., registered offices at 600 West Chicago Avenue, Chicago, Illinois - 60610, USA, and to Groupon UK, located in the UK. Transfer of personal data to the US is authorised under the Privacy Law since Groupon Inc. has adhered to the Safe Harbor Principles, while transfer to the UK is allowed as the European Commission has recognised that the UK is a country which provides an adequate level of data protection.

  * As necessary to perform contractual obligations toward you with business partners to the extent you have purchased an accommodation reservation or other services from us and to be supplied by a business partner.

We encourage suppliers and business partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, while we share personal data with suppliers and business partners only for the above-mentioned purposes and under the above-mentioned conditions, their subsequent processing and use of personal data obtained through Groupon Travel is governed by their own privacy policies and practices and not subject to our control.

In particular, given the nature of our business, it is likely some recipients may be located outside the European Union, in countries with an inadequate level of data protection under the Privacy Law. You recognise and understand that when you make a reservation, we will pass your personal information to the supplier or business partner who is responsible for fulfilling your reservation so that they may provide you with the accommodation you have reserved.
