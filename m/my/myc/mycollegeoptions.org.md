# Free College Search For Entrance Admissions, Applications Process, Student Loans Financial Aid Criteria, Freshman SAT, ACT, PSAT Scores, Courses Offered and other University Background Information.

  


My College Options is a free service for high schools, students, and their families. The program is funded by colleges, universities, trade schools, military branches, and other educational and career service providers offering products and services such as student loans and financial aid, college admissions and tutorial services, extra-curricular enrichment and recognition programs, career, employment and military opportunities, and camps.

All information is voluntarily submitted by students interested in matching their personal information with potential post-secondary career and educational opportunities. Students are given the option on the questionnaire to permit or deny contact and a student’s data will be shared only if the student has explicitly granted permission. _At no time will any data be shared or sold to commercial enterprises outside the education and career arenas._   In addition, participating colleges and universities have access to information only for those matched students who have expressly given permission for contact.

Our web server automatically recognizes your domain name, but not your e-mail address. We do not collect nonpublic personal information from visitors to our sites unless you expressly provide it to us. The information we do collect from our web sites (such as domain name, number of hits, pages visited and length of user session) may be combined to analyze how our web sites are used. This information is then used to improve the usefulness of the sites. 

Like most web sites, we use "cookies" to enhance your online experience. Cookies are pieces of data that we temporarily place on your computer's hard drive to help us identify you. In general, the cookies that we place on your hard drive remain active only while you have your browser open. They expire as soon as you close your browser. They are not used to collect any personal information. 

For visitors to our web sites who are presented with a questionnaire, we may place a cookie on your hard drive to identify whether you have completed or declined to complete that particular questionnaire. This cookie is not designed to collect personal information about you. Rather it is designed to make your return visits more pleasant by preventing the same survey from being offered to you again. 

For CollegeAnswer.com registered users who have chosen our auto log-on feature, a non-expiring cookie is stored on your hard drive to allow us to immediately tell us who you are when you return to the site. We do not intend to collect nonpublic personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected this information from a child under the age of 13, we will promptly take all reasonable steps to delete the data from our system. 

From time to time, you may access our sites through a co-branded page of one of our marketing partners. We will try to show clearly, by placing our marketing partner's name or logo in a prominent place or otherwise, whether a page is co-branded. If you provide your information on a co-branded page, your registration information may be shared with our marketing partner. It is important to remember that, if you link to a third-party site from any of our web sites, that party's privacy policy and its terms and conditions of use apply to you. We encourage you to learn about each third party's privacy policy before giving personal information to them. 

If you give us nonpublic personal information, unless prohibited by law, you may request that the nonpublic personal information be removed from our system by contacting us at the address indicated at the end of this policy. If you register information on our Web sites, you also have the right, upon reasonable notice, to view that information and correct it if necessary. 

In our information technology systems environment, NRCCUA safeguards your information according to industry established security standards. We also routinely test our systems to ensure a high level of security.
