# Privacy Policy | Cricket Wireless

Cricket Communications, Inc. and its parent corporation, Leap Wireless International, Inc. (jointly referred to below as "Cricket"), have adopted a privacy policy that limits what Cricket can do with customer information. Subject to this Privacy Policy and applicable government regulations, Cricket uses information that you provide us to learn more about your needs as a customer, to maintain and improve our networks, to improve our products and services, to provide you with information, services and notices we think will interest you, and to create reports containing aggregated data about our customers for use in connection with our business.

Cricket is constantly striving to enhance the quality and selection of the products and services that we offer to you as our customer. As a result, we may also share information about you with others in an effort to provide you with or inform you of additional products, services or information that may be of interest to you.

We may also use information you provide us, including information about your personal preferences to provide you with personalized messages and ads for products and services we think will interest you. We may select the messages and ads you receive based on the information you have provided to us and on your responses to previous ads and other communications from us. We may also use your call usage patterns and the other information you have provided to us to determine the number and frequency of the messages we send to you.

To allow you to control the use of personal information about you, you can instruct us:

  * not to inform you of product and service offers from third-parties; and/or
  * not to provide your personally-identifiable information to non-affiliated third-parties in an effort to provide you with or inform you of additional products, services or information without your prior consent.



You can provide these instructions to us by [clicking here to Opt-out](https://web.archive.org/support/email-optout).

We need to use your personal information to provide you with certain features offered on your Cricket速 phone. If you instruct us to restrict the use of your personal information through one of the options outlined above, but you also subscribe to a Cricket速 feature that requires us to use your personal information, your instruction will not prevent us from using your personal information to provide the Cricket速 feature to you as long as you continue to subscribe to that feature.

INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA MYCRICKET WEBSITE

No personally-identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address) is collected from you via our website, unless you provide it to us voluntarily. You may be required to provide personally-identifiable information to us when you register with the website, order products or services, request information about new or current Cricket products or services, apply for Cricket速 Rewards and the like. In general, we automatically gather certain usage information such as the number and frequency of visitors to our websites. We accomplish the gathering of data through the use of a technology nicknamed "cookies." We also use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to [http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy.](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy)

CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY

We limit access to personal information about you to employees, agents, consultants, authorized dealers and professionals who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Your account information is password-protected. In certain areas Cricket uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions.

Regardless of any instructions you have given to us, Cricket may give out personal information about you to third parties without your consent:

  * to comply with governmental laws, regulations and orders (including subpoenas relating to personal or private electronic communications transmitted on our networks and/or other information about our business or our subscribers),
  * to cooperate with governmental investigations,
  * to respond to requests for information from emergency personnel (such as 911 service providers), and
  * to take reasonable measures to protect our rights.



In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may monitor the pattern of your communications over our networks (1) to satisfy any governmental law, regulation, or order; (2) if necessary or appropriate to operate our businesses; or (3) to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of others.

FURTHER, IN CONNECTION WITH THE POTENTIAL SALE OR TRANSFER OF ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS INTERESTS, CRICKET RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELL OR TRANSFER PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WE HAVE COLLECTED ABOUT YOU (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, YOUR ADDRESS, NAME, AGE, GENDER, ZIP CODE, STATE AND COUNTRY OF RESIDENCY AND OTHER INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE TO US) TO A THIRD PARTY ENTITY THAT AGREES TO BE CRICKET'S SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST WITH REGARD TO THE MAINTENANCE AND PROTECTION OF SUCH INFORMATION. We may also provide access or information to our affiliated businesses or business partners.

Our privacy policy may change from time to time, so please check with us periodically.
