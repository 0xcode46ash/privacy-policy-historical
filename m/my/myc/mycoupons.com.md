It also allows you to simply read and send email from the web browser. We do not read users email. We offer highest level of privacy offered by the Critical Path software/system to protect the users data.

DirectStuff.com, Inc., holds all data gathered in strict confidence. Under no circumstances will your e-mail address be sold to, supplied to, or otherwise made available to any third party.
