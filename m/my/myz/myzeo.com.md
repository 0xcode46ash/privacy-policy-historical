# Privacy Policy | Zeo Sleep Manager

**Privacy Policy**

**Effective: May 12, 2009 (updated September 26, 2011)**

Welcome to the web site (the “ **Site** ”) of Zeo, Inc. (“ **Zeo** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **us** ” and/or “ **our** ”). Through the Site, including without limitation the corporate-branded area and the area of the Site made available to registered owners of the Zeo Sleep Manager Mobile and Bedside sleep management devices (the “ **Zeo Sleep Manager Devices** ”), you will have access to an educational tool and motivational program that helps you learn about your sleep and which habits and behaviors may be keeping you from enjoying the sleep that you need (collectively, the “ **Zeo Services** ”). Neither the Zeo Sleep Manager Devices nor the Zeo Services are a medical device nor a medical program and none of them are intended for the diagnosis and/or treatment of sleep disorders.

Your privacy is very important to us at Zeo. Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy to explain our policy with respect to personally identifiable data (“ **Personal Data** ”) and other information that is collected from those who use our Site.

**Information We Collect:**

When you interact with us through the Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:

**Personal Data That You Provide Through Registration:** We collect Personal Data from you when you register with the Site and create an account.  Except in connection with your order to purchase a product through the Site, we do not collect any credit card or other financial account information, driver’s license numbers and/or social security numbers.

**Personal Data That You Provide Through Other Use of the Site:  ** We also collect Personal Data from you when you access the Zeo Services and/or other parts of the Site and elect to provide Personal Data through the Site.  For example, when you use a Zeo Sleep Manager Device, we will collect sleep data that you upload to the Site and information that you input in your sleep journal, such as details regarding your sleeping environment, your feelings, behaviors and other factors that may impact your sleep.

**By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Zeo and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.**

**At no time shall Personal Data collected from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any information or materials derived from such Personal Data be deemed to be an electronic health record or an electronic medical record for any purpose whatsoever under any law or regulation, including without limitation for purposes of compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.** **Other Information:** When you access the Zeo Services through the Site, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot be used to specifically identify you. Zeo may store such information itself and/or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Zeo affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.    In operating this Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features.
