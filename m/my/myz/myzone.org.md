We also collect information passively from the Myzone belt, including heart rate data.

_The primary reason for requesting information is to personalise your experience and allow you to enjoy the full benefits of being able to monitor your physical activity through measuring, recording and displaying your heart rate while using the Myzone belt. The information we collect from you may also be used in the following ways:

• To improve our website(we continually strive to improve our website based on the information and feedback we receive from you)

• To send periodic emails. The email address you provide will only be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your Myzone belt or matters which are believed may be of interest.  
• We request information from Myzone facilities so that they can register as a Myzone site owner, access the names of those that have registered belts at their facility, so they can communicate with them, and to enhance belt users’ experience of the Myzone system.

 _ **Do we use cookies?**_

_Yes (Cookies are small files that a site transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables us to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information).

We use cookies to help us remember and process site preferences so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We do not share cookies with third parties.

_

 _ **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**_

_We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information except in the following situations: _Subcontractors._ From time to time we may share information with subcontractors that provide us with services. These services include, among other things, assisting us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you. We require our subcontractors to agree to keep the personal information that they receive confidential. _Your Facilities._ If you register or use your Myzone belt at a facility (health club, community hub, school or employer etc.), your information may be accessed by individuals engaged by those facilities (for example, so that they can deliver a service to you) and you expressly consent to your personal information being used in this manner. It must be noted that such individuals are not our employees or agents (except to the extent that they may collect in some situations consent to our privacy policies on our behalf) and you should satisfy yourself that the facility has procedures in place to protect your privacy (and, if applicable, the privacy of any child – see ‘Children’s Online Privacy’, below).To enable users to enjoy the Myzone experience it is mandatory and unavoidable for facilities to have access to personal information including the name, email address, gender, date of birth, belt ID, and maximum and resting heart rates of belt users. Facilities can also access data showing when belt users have participated in any class activity, the duration of such activity, and the amount of calories burnt. The facilities do not have access to any personal biometric data unless you permit them to have such access._

|   |  __Business Transition._ In the event that we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired, your information will be transferred to the acquiring company. _Sharing Your Information with Law Enforcement._ We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful, or that we reasonably believe may aid a law enforcement investigation into unlawful activity. In addition, we reserve the right to release your information to law enforcement agencies if we determine, in our sole judgment, that either you have violated our policies, or the release of your information may protect the rights, property or safety of a person or entity. _Sharing Your Information as Permitted by Law._ We may share your information with others as required by, or permitted by, law. This may include sharing your information with governmental entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal process, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us.

You may Choose to Share your Information. You may choose to grant permission to 1) your facility so that they can view your biometric data and 2) your friends and trainers etc. by reference to their email address so that they can view one or more of your activities, food diary, biometrics and (provided you are aged 18 or over) body images.

Notwithstanding the above, we may provide anonymised (non-personally identifiable) information to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

_ _ **Children’s Online Privacy**_

_We are mindful that the belt and system will be attractive and of benefit to users under the age of 13 and it is our policy, regardless of the country in which the facility is located, to ensure that parents or teachers (if they are authorised and it is legal for them to do so) can monitor data collected in respect of such persons. We try to achieve this through adopting an approach which is compliant with the United States legislation known as the _Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act_ (‘COPPA’).

Our website, products and services are all available to persons who are below 13 years of age. A parent or teacher(as advised to us) of any child who has not attained 13 years of age can review their child's/student’s personal information, ask to have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child's information. If the parent or teacher wishes to exercise this right they should contact us in writing using the information below. We only collect personal information that is required to provide the service: **please note that the removal of such personal information will render the belt and service inoperable.**

The parent or teacher of any person aged below 13 years is required to consent to the collection and use of their child's or student’s personal information at the time of registering a belt. Parents and teachers must communicate this consent through completion of a consent form which is available through us or our distributors. These consent forms must be verified as follows:(1) in the case of a parent, a Parental Consent Form in respect of the child must be completed and then verified by the facility in which the belt is registered; or (2) in the case of a teacher, an Educational Institution Consent Form must be completed and verified, through the education facility where the belt is registered, by providing in respect of that teacher, a Union Card, State Issued Teaching Certificate, Home Schooling Certificate, State Issued Preschool/Daycare Facility Certificate/License, Home Schooler Affidavit or IHIP Approval Letter from School District or State.

Parents and teachers (as applicable) will receive a copy of all email communications that are sent to their child or student, until such child or student has attained the age of 13. This will enable them to monitor data in respect of such children and/or students.
