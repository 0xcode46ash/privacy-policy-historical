**Balancing Poses**  
Balancing postures and movements in yoga help improve our posture and develop coordination. Balancing on one foot, on our knees, or even in a seated position helps train the mind to focus attentively while developing strength and stamina in our bodies.   
In approaching a balancing pose always direct your gaze to one steady point (called a 'drishti' in Sanskrit). Keeping the eyes still helps us to still the mind; creating a visual anchor. Focus your thoughts on your breath. Take time in your approach. Be patient and playful.  
When we are focused we are balanced, when we are balanced we are focused.
