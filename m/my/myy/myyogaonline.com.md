**Yoga and The Spine**  
  
Strong muscles support your frame and give good posture. Yoga keeps the muscles strong and is a caretaker of the spine, structural core of the body. Lengthening and strengthening it, yoga keeps the spine limber and agile like it was when we were small children. Since the spine houses the central nervous system (which also includes the brain), keeping the spine healthy will enhance all other functions of the human body. This means the body will move with grace and ease, feel and look better, and age well.
