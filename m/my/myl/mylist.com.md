# youknowbest.com - About Us

Our Privacy Policy

We are very serious about privacy at youknowbest. We have done our best to provide information about every aspect of our site and our software downloads myList, the Best Price Toolbar and BestGrid. If you'd like to know more or have a question, please e-mail us at [privacy@youknowbest.com](mailto:privacy@youknowbest.com). 

Your personal information 

You are always in control of personal information with the myList tools. Personalizing your experience is up to you. You may create and save lists of your favorite products by clicking "Add to list" at any time while using myList, the Best Price Toolbar and BestGrid. 

We do not require any information about you to be stored on our servers, other than a member name and password to access your account. If you choose to store personal information on our servers, we will not provide this personal information to any third party. Information you could choose to store includes your name, e-mail address, product information, and Web site links. 

When you are using myList and the Best Price Toolbar for product research, **Web addresses (URLs) that you visit are anonymously sent back to us** to make sure we provide you with up to date product and pricing information. While myList is in beta, the entire URL is sent to us. These URLs may sometimes contain personally identifiable information like log-in names for non-secure vendor sites. If myList does not recognize products on a Web page, we do not store any data from that page and automatically delete any record of it. 

**We do not associate these URLs with your account** and automatically discard them after the price matching process. (When myList beta testing is complete, we will only transmit non-personally identifiable data in the URL to determine the best price.)If you save a product in myList, we recognize that you have saved a product and associate it with your account, which may contain any personally identifiable information that you choose to disclose. 

**We do not sell or otherwise share your personally identifiable information with third parties** , but may release anonymous product data (for example: the most popular digital camera saved by myList members). 

We do not collect demographic information. We may give you the option to provide some or all of your information for aggregated marketing research in the future. The decision to participate is up to you. In order for us to conduct purchases on your behalf, we will collect and store transaction details. We do not accept additional information about you from third parties and will not do so without your prior consent. 

We may store your individual purchasing history for products and services purchased through myList in the future. For business management and reporting purposes, we may track and report individual and aggregated purchases of products and services. We never personally identify these transactions, except for the purposes of providing you with purchase history tracking. 

Your password locks your information. Others cannot open your information without your permission. 

When you send us an e-mail, we may collect your e-mail address. This address is used only to respond to your inquiry. We do not sell or share this information with any third parties and will never send unsolicited e-mail messages to you. All communication between you and the myList services is voluntary -- you may choose at any time to opt-out of updates and special offers by changing your preference settings. When you choose to share product information through youknowbest, the party you are sharing with will be able to view your e-mail address. 

We may send out a periodic e-mail informing you of technical service issues, new feature announcements and news about myList products and services. These e-mails are considered essential to the service you have requested. Upon receiving the first of these types of messages, however, you will be given the option to unsubscribe to these mailings by replying to the e-mail message with "Remove" in the subject line. 

youknowbest vendors, content affiliates and manufacturers each have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read these policies before doing business with a site. We provide vendor ratings on the "See Prices" page for each product for your convenience.
