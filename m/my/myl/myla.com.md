# Privacy Policy - Myla's Designer Lingerie Shop Online

At Myla we know that one of the things that our customers enjoy about their personal lives is that it is a private oasis in their busy lives. We feel the same way and so we are committed to protecting your privacy and security.

We understand that when you shop online you want to know that your name, address, credit card details and other personal information you entrust us with, are kept safe and secure. And because we understand and respect this, we promise not to pass on any of your personal details on to any third party.

Within Myla we will only make your details available to personnel who require them to perform their role. All of our customer service advisors work within a password protected environment, and sign confidentiality clauses as a part of their contracts.  
Information We Collect and How We Use It

Whenever you place an order we need to know your name, telephone number, email, address, delivery address and credit or debit card details. This allows us to process and fulfil your order and to notify you on its status.

For some international deliveries your telephone number may be given to our couriers.

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature we may ask for your name, address and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

We may personalise your shopping experience by using your purchases to shape future recommendations about Myla merchandise that we think you might be interested in.

We also monitor customer traffic activity and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the online store we think you will most enjoy.

We may use the information we collect to notify you occasionally about special promotional offers, changes to the website, and new services we think you’ll be excited by. If you would rather not receive this information then simply tick the “Do Not Mail” box when you register with us and we promise not to bother you.

Myla may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-parties, but these statistics will not include any personally identifying information.  
Your Consent

While we make every effort to ensure that any personal information we collect from you is kept secure and processed lawfully, the internet is not a totally secure medium.

By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Myla, and also acknowledge and agree that we shall not be held responsible for any unauthorised use, distribution, damage or destruction of personal data, except to the extent that we are required to accept such responsibility by the Data Protection Act of 1998.

From time to time we may revise our Privacy Policy. If we decide to do so we will post the changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.

If you have any queries about our Privacy Policy or the protection of personal information, please do not hesitate to contact us.

If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy you should not submit your personal information on the Myla website.
