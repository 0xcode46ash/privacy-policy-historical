Becoming a parent, flipped my world upside down, and there was no way I was going to miss the first laugh, the first word, the first step, or any milestone in between.Staying at home not only meant quality time with my daughter, but also allowed more time to do what I love…Pen my thoughts down on my blog.  
I strongly believe in breaking all the stereotype ways of parenting.   
For me parenting is all about love and fun. My girls and I believe in jamming out in the car, in dancing in the rains, and in miracles. We believe in smiling till our cheek hurt and laughing till our neighbours’ ears burst. Parenting definitely comes with loads of challenges,but trust me facing these challenges becomes much more easier by having a fun and a happy attitude towards it.
