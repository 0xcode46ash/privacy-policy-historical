### NFO MySurvey.com Privacy Policy

**Policy Effective Date:** March 1998   
**Last Revised:** February 2005 

This page discloses the privacy practices of the NFO MySurvey.com website. If you arrived at this page via one of our cobranded partner sites, please be assured that the privacy policy that you see here is in effect for all NFO MySurvey.com panel members regardless of how they are directed to our registration form. (NOTE: We use the term "cobranded" to mean that our partner sites' logo or in some cases, a masthead that looks similar to the partner site appears on the NFO MySurvey.com website pages in order to give the user a sense of continuity. However, only NFO MySurvey.com collects information on NFO MySurvey.com pages; the ways in which we use this information and protect your privacy are described below.)

**Our Privacy Pledge**  
|   
When you participate as a panel member your privacy is assured.  
  
  * We will not make any personal information of our panel members available to anyone without your knowledge (as described in this policy), except in the rare instances required by law. This includes your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.

  * We will never try to sell you anything - that is not our business. We will never sell your name to anyone else who might want to sell you anything.

  * Occasionally, we may contact you to validate responses. We will never misrepresent ourselves or what we are doing.

  * Your individual responses to surveys will also be kept confidential and will never be linked to your personal identifying information.

  * Your decisions about participating in a study, responding to specific questions, or discontinuing participation will be respected without question.

**How Information Is Used**  
|   
The Information We Collect & How We Use It  
  
When you register as an interactive panel member, we collect the following personal identifying information: your name, postal service address, email address, and phone number.

We use your name and email address to let you know about opportunities to take surveys, to provide new updates about NFO MySurvey.com that may be of interest to our panelists, to enter you automatically into the sweepstakes program, and to inform you about special programs and benefits we are offering to our panel members (such as special gifts or incentives or our sweepstakes program). Generally, panel members are notified about an opportunity to take a survey several times per month. We also send brief emails to our interactive panel members several times a year to provide information of interest and to express our appreciation for their participation.

We use postal service addresses to mail free gifts offered to panel members, prizes to sweepstakes winners, products to test, and cash or merchandise that you redeem with your Reward Points. Products to test, cash prizes and cash redemptions will be mailed directly to panel members by the NFO MySurvey.com team and thus do not require sharing of your name and address with outside parties. However, we will supply your name and postal address to merchandise suppliers if you redeem your Reward Points for merchandise (or select the merchandise option for a prize you win) so they can ship to you directly. Occasionally, we ask our interactive panel members if they would be willing to take certain special paper and pencil surveys. We ask your permission prior to mailing such surveys as well as providing information about the benefits of taking such a survey. On average, panelists receive something through the U.S. mail once or less per year.

We use phone numbers to notify sweepstakes program winners who have not responded to e-mail. We also call panel members in response to their request for a return call to answer a question or address any concerns. On rare occasions, we call panelists to validate survey responses. Most interactive panel members are never contacted via phone.

NFO MySurvey.com asks sweepstakes prize winners if we can post their first name and last initial (or just their initials) along with home town location on the Winners' page of this website. We post names only after permission is granted and respect any winners' requests that their names not be publicized.

NFO MySurvey.com frequently asks panel members for demographic information (such as age, gender, household composition), computer and web access capabilities, and lifestyle information (for example, types of vehicles owned or business/recreational travel). NFO MySurvey.com uses this information to select surveys that are appropriate for the panel member (or a member of the panelist's household). For example, a survey related to satisfaction with stays at various hotel chains might be sent only to those panelists who indicate a certain frequency of travel. We sometimes use birth date information to send birthday greetings to our panel members.

NFO MySurvey.com asks panel members for their opinions about a variety of products and services by asking them to complete surveys via e-mail or at the NFO MySurvey.com website. Usually, NFO MySurvey.com combines the individual panelist responses and reports on the aggregated (or group) results. Individual level responses are occasionally used, but never associated with any personal identifying information. For surveys offered at the panelist website, panel members are asked for their user name and password (rather than any personal identifying information).

NFO MySurvey.com may occasionally ask for other personal identifying information as part of a specific survey. In these cases, we will provide an explanation in the survey introduction to allow members to make an informed decision about participation. The explanation will include a description of any new identifying information that will be collected via the survey and with whom it will be shared. As with any survey, members can decline to take the survey or stop at any time during the survey process. Like all other information we collect, any additional information collected for a specific survey will be used for research purposes only.

NFO MySurvey.com also automatically collects information via log files to administer the site and to aid in technical problem solving. Log file information collected is IP address, time a page was viewed, name of pages viewed within the NFO MySurvey.com site during the specific visit, browser type, URL parameters, and cookies that were set by the NFO MySurvey.com website at the time of the visit. Log files may also include information indicating where a visitor came from. This information is used only to administer the site and to identify and resolve any technical problems related to the site's operation. Log file information is never linked to personal identifying information.

When you participate in the Refer A Friend program we ask for your friend's first name and email address. The first name is used in the greeting to personalize the message and the email address is needed to deliver it to your friend. Both pieces of information are stored only temporarily, for a long enough time to make sure the email was sent without difficulty and are never used for any other purpose. Participation in the Referral Program, like all aspects of NFO MySurvey.com membership, is completely voluntary.

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Panel member names, addresses, and phone numbers are maintained on a secured database accessible only by NFO MySurvey.com research staff. Panel members may also access their own information for the purposes of verifying and updating, but they cannot view other members' information.

As is the case with any information you provide to any business operating in the United States, information provided to NFO MySurvey.com is subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.

**Updating Your Personal Information**  
|   
Policies on Correcting/Updating Personal Information  
  
NFO MySurvey.com relies on panel members themselves to provide any updates to personal identifying information. Members may update email addresses, password, mailing address, phone number as well as name of the person who initially registered by going to the Update Your Info section of this website (available to members only). For changes to any other personal information, including user name, panel members are asked to contact NFO MySurvey.com via [email](http://205.181.199.142/nfofaq/faq.asp) or by phone. The toll-free customer service number is 1-800-537-4097. Customer service hours are M-F 8 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. EST, and Sat-Sun 10 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. EST. Members may also update their email addresses or other information by [emailing](http://205.181.199.142/nfofaq/faq.asp), by calling, or by mailing in their changes (see postal address at the end of this page), whatever they prefer. (Please note that changes sent via the postal service will take longer to implement due to time needed for mail delivery.)

NFO MySurvey.com may occasionally supplement information obtained from panel members with information obtained from a third party (such as demographic or ownership information that NFO MySurvey.com doesn't typically collect, e.g. small dog ownership). NFO MySurvey.com may also use third party database applications to provide services to our members (such as customer support or communications to members). In such cases, we ensure your privacy by having these third parties sign a written, legally binding agreement stipulating that they will not share NFO MySurvey.com data with any outside party and that any individual identifying information is to be used solely for the purpose of matching records or providing the agreed upon database service.

NFO MySurvey.com may also exchange information with our partner sites for the member's benefit and with the member's knowledge (in accordance with this privacy policy). These benefits include opportunities to earn additional rewards on the partner site and/or to eliminate NFO MySurvey.com advertising to those who are already NFO MySurvey.com members. The information exchanged will be the member ID and/or email address (the minimum information needed to provide the benefit). We ensure your privacy by having our partner sites sign a written, legally binding agreement stipulating they will not share your individual identifying information and that it is to be used solely for the purpose of providing you with additional rewards and to eliminate redundant advertising.

**Use Of Cookies**  
|   
How We Use Cookies on Our Website  
  
NFO MySurvey.com uses cookies on our registration and survey forms during the time you are actively completing the forms. These cookies are used for technical purposes to allow for accurate transmission of survey information to the NFO MySurvey.com database and to ensure that a member does not take the same survey more than once. For longer surveys, we use cookies to make form completion more convenient for the panelist. They allow for completion of the form in more than one sitting; you take up where you left off rather than starting from the beginning again. 

NFO MySurvey.com also uses cookies on the member area of the site to store user name automatically and password (optionally) so that the user does not have to repeatedly retype the information. For users' convenience, this cookie is stored for subsequent sessions. Member area cookies are also used to identify valid members in order to protect access to their specific member information (such as rewards account information) and to personalize their experience on the site. The web server also creates cookies to uniquely identify each user session when a member visits the site. This latter cookie is automatically deleted at the end of a session.

No personal identifying information is stored on any cookie nor do we retain any cookied information on our databases.

Because cookies are used to identify valid members to protect access to their specific member information and to personalize their member experience, users who choose not to allow cookies cannot register nor can they access the member area of the NFO MySurvey.com website with its associated member benefits (such as taking surveys, earning reward points and redeeming rewards).

**Notification Of Changes**  
|   
How We Notify You About Changes to Our Privacy Policy  
  
If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated in our privacy policy at the time of collection, we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner; instructions for how to make that choice will be included in the email. If we make any material changes to our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our website notifying our members that there is a change and pointing them to the revised privacy page. 

Occasionally, we conduct studies with partner companies on the partner's website, which may operate under a different privacy policy. Like all our other studies, participation in these studies is completely voluntary and informed. We notify select members via email about these research opportunities and provide a complete description of what is involved and any member benefits. On occasion, we invite members to take this type of survey without email notification (that is, the survey is waiting when they visit the site or they are invited to take a second survey at the conclusion of participation of another survey). In all these cases, we will explicitly state if some or all of the survey will be conducted at the partner site and if so, what privacy policy is in operation for the study (this NFO MySurvey.com privacy policy or a different policy). As necessary, we will provide a link to the partner's privacy policy or to the policy pertaining to the particular study. This information will be put in the email notification for those surveys that have an email notification. For surveys where there is no email notification, the information will be included in the survey introduction. Members may decline to participate in these studies or drop out of the study at any time. When survey notification is via email, they can simply not click on the link to the survey. If the information is contained in the survey introduction, an easy way will be provided for the user to exit the survey (for example, a button on the survey intro page with "prefer not to participate"; a click exits them from the survey and places them on the last page they visited).
