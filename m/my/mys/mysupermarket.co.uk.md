# Privacy policy | mySupermarket

**A. Protecting You**

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and other applicable data protection laws in the UK).

We collect information about you to provide you with the best possible service and to provide you with, and tell you about, related services from us and marketing about ourselves and third parties (but we will not give your details to those third parties without your consent) , all as further explained in this policy.

Also, if you agree to register or sign-in to participate in the Maximiles Programme on or through the Website, then you agree that you will provide the data that you give to us (and that we accrue for that purpose) to Maximiles for Maximiles' own marketing activities to you 

, as further explained in this policy. 

**B. The Information We Collect**

Our privacy policy ensures that any information you provide us remains private and secure. To reassure you, below we provide details of the information you provide to us, and how it will, and more importantly, will not be used. We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. The information we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check the information that we hold about you by contacting us (and there may be an administrative fee payable for this). If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly.

Here are some examples of the data we collect and reasons why:

  * During the course of using the Service, you may be asked to provide your postcode for delivery - this allows us to identify which supermarkets deliver in your area and the products in particular supermarkets may vary by locality. 
  * When you register for the Service you are asked to provide your name, email address and password - this helps us recognise you when you return so that we can provide you with a faster service. 
  * We may also ask you to provide your age and possibly certain other personal details such as gender or where you heard about us. We collect these types of details for marketing purposes but we will never provide these details to third parties outside our group unless in anonymous form or as we say elsewhere in this policy. 
  * If you give us your email address when you register with us (or at any other time) **you are giving us your consent to receive emails from us** , which can be about: 
    * Information to do with the services we offer;
    * Marketing (being details of either our own or third party promotions, vouchers or special deals - although we will never pass your email address to those third parties). (You always have the option to later unsubscribe from certain types of (or all) marketing emails, although if you do this, we may keep your email address on our files for analysis purposes or because you use other of our services.)
  * When you register or sign-in for participation in the Maximiles Programme on or through the Website, you need to provide us with your email address, password for your participation in the Maximiles Programme, first name, last name, address and postcode, which we will pass on to Maximiles for your participation in the Maximiles Programme. We will receive a reference from Maximiles that identifies you uniquely, and we use that reference in order to inform Maximiles how many points should be attributed to your Maximiles Programme account. 
  * We keep a record of items you purchased in your favourites list, thus allowing you to shop more quickly on future visits. 
  * We keep a record of the contents of your Trolleys between shopping sessions. This allows you to continue shopping sessions that you may have stopped midway with no need to add again all the items that you already placed in your Trolley. 
  * We may also keep a record of the contents of your Trolley after you have sent it to a Supermarket. This is to ensure that you receive the allocation of points attributed by us for your participation within the Maximiles Programme. 
  * We keep a record of your preferences such as sorting order of items and last shelf you bought in, so you don't need to reset these preferences every time you start shopping. 
  * We keep track of your emails and contacts with customer support, so that we can provide you with a responsive and efficient service. 
  * If you import favourites from one of the Supermarkets or if you book a delivery slot from one of the Supermarkets or when you place an order with the Supermarkets (using the Service), we ask you to enter your login details for that Supermarket (usually email and password). You may authorise us to save your Supermarket password access details. If so, we will retain these only to facilitate your speedier interaction with a Supermarket (so that you do not continually have to re-enter such details) and we will not use this information for any other purpose. 
  * We keep details of your favourites from Supermarkets and details of previous Trolley you have ordered so that we can better display your favourite items to you as part of the Service. 
  * At times (although not always) we also offer a free newsletter. You may sign up to receive our free newsletter when we offer it and you do this by providing your email address to us for this purpose. (You always have the option to later unsubscribe, although if you do this, we may keep your email address on our files for analysis purposes or because you use other of our services.) 
  * We collect and may display or use for the purposes of marketing and advertising the Website, Service or ourselves, any testimonials you provide us with about the Website, the Service or ourselves - and we may append to the testimonial your first name (but not your surname) and general geographic location (e.g. City or locale). 
  * If you have been referred to us by another website, we may keep a record of the website that referred you so that we may work out which websites refer more or less users to mysupermarket.co.uk. We may also have referral arrangements with websites and referrers and we may use this data to fulfil obligations that we may have to these websites or referrers. 
  * We collect and track statistical non-personal information about shopping habits, goods and service preferences and selections which customers have made and the likes for the purpose of business research and for the general improvement of the Service. 



**C. Third parties**

**We will never give your personal data over to any third party (whether by giving it, selling it or renting) for their marketing purposes without your consent.**

We may use your personal data ourselves to let you know about third party offers, promotions, vouchers or special deals (e.g. by us sending you emails) but we will never give your personal data to those third parties without your consent. Also, you will be able to unsubscribe from such emails at any time.

We may pass your details to our agents and subcontractors to help us with any of our uses of your data set out in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may use third parties to provide us with marketing or customer service assistance.

We may send your information internationally including to countries outside the European Economic Area. Some places outside of the EEA may not have adequate data protection laws at all or may offer differing levels of protection of personal information which are not as high as in the UK. By submitting your data to us, you acknowledge that provided we have used your data in the ways set out in this Privacy Policy, we cannot be held responsible for any use of your data by third parties who receive and process your data. 

We may exchange information with third parties (including but not limited to Supermarkets and Maximiles) for the purposes of fraud protection.

We may transfer our databases containing your personal information if we sell our business or part of it. 

We may disclose your personal data to third parties without obtaining your prior consent if we are required to do so by law. 

The Site may contain advertising of third parties and reference to third party service providers (such as Maximiles). Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any third parties or other sites, nor for any third party to whom we transfer your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**D. Affiliate Networks**

We may be member of affiliate networks who make a small payment to us if people visit certain websites from our Website or certain parts of websites (such as websites of the Supermarkets or certain parts of mySupermarket.co.uk) (which we call "Visited Websites"). None of your personal details will be passed to any such affiliate network. However, to record that you have visited a Visited Website from our Website, the affiliate network may place a "cookie" (i.e. a small text file) on your computer. That cookie lasts about a month. See the section of this Privacy Policy entitled "Technology" for more details.

**E. E-mails we send you**

Please note that we may e-mail for the following purposes: 

  * as part of the Service. For example, we send (or may send) emails to you in some of the following example circumstances: 
    * after registration for the Service, notifying you of your registration details;
    * as reminder emails about the services we offer (particularly if you have not used them yet or not used them for a while;
    * after you have sent a Trolley, giving you details about that;
    * with details of how to register or sign-in for your participation in the Maximiles Programme;
    * to send you information which you have asked for (for example, you may have elected to receive newsletters or information on offers from Supermarkets), although we will always give you the chance to unsubscribe from these; and
  * to offer related services to you. However, in terms of any marketing emails we may send, we will always give you the chance to opt-out (or unsubscribe) from any marketing email from us in the future.

**F. Security**

The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the law. For example, where we hold passwords (e.g. the password allocated as part of the registration process - which may later be changed); your Supermarket access password - if you allow us to do so; your Maximiles password – which we send to Maximiles; etc.) we hold them using secure encryption. See our [Security section](https://web.archive.org/Administration/Security.aspx) for more details. 

**G. Technology**

Our Website and Service use "cookies" (and, in certain circumstances, “flash cookies”) technology to store data in your computer using the functionality of your browser. A lot of websites do this, because cookies allow the website publisher to do useful things like find out whether the computer (and probably its user) has visited the site before. For example (and as detailed in the section of this Privacy Policy called "Affiliate Networks"), affiliate networks may place a limited life cookie (i.e. a small text file which "expires" after a certain time) in your computer to record that have visited our Website before visiting a Visited Website.

You can usually modify your browser to prevent cookie use - but if you do this the Service (and the Website) will not work properly. The information stored in the cookie is used to identify you. This enables us to operate an efficient service and to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to the website.
