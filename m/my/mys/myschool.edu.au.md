# Privacy Policy | ACARA

Version 2.0. Last updated 7 March 2014

## Summary

####   
 **1. Scope**

Our privacy policy sets out how we comply with our obligations under the [_Privacy Act 1988_](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00903) ( **Privacy Act** ). As an Australian Government agency, we are bound by the [Australian Privacy Principles](http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-resources/privacy-fact-sheets/other/privacy-fact-sheet-17-australian-privacy-principles) (APPs) in the Privacy Act, which regulate how agencies may collect, use, disclose and store personal information, and how individuals may access and correct personal information held about them.

This part of our privacy policy provides you with a high level overview of how we handle your personal information.

####  **2. ACARA’s functions**

The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority ( **ACARA** ) was established under the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Act 2008 (Cth) ( **ACARA Act** ). Our functions under section 6 of the ACARA Act include, relevantly (and in summarised form): 

  * develop and administer a national school curriculum;
  * develop and administer national assessments;
  * collect, manage and analyse student assessment data and other data relating to schools and comparative school performance;
  * facilitate information sharing arrangements between Australian government bodies in relation to the collection, management and analysis of school data; and
  * publish information relating to school education, including information relating to comparative school performance. 



In broad terms, and relevantly for this policy, we are charged with developing a national school curriculum, developing national assessments and collecting, managing and analysing data on a national scale that relates to student assessment and schools.

####  **3. ACARA’s mission**

Our mission is improving the learning of all young Australians, through world-class school curriculum, assessment and reporting. We hold personal information in relation to the Australian Curriculum (e.g. student work samples), the National Assessment Program (e.g. licences for third party materials in tests) and reporting (e.g. data that informs _My School_ reporting). Our use of personal information assists us in performing our statutory functions and fulfilling our mission.

####  **4. Layered privacy policy**

In drafting this policy, we have adopted the ‘layered’ privacy policy approach used by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner ( **OAIC** ) (high level overview + further detail). This document provides you with a high level overview of how we handle your personal information. You can access more information regarding how we handle your personal information at:

Our privacy policy (comprising this suite of documents) replaces our previous privacy policy on our websites and has been updated to include amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ( **Privacy Act** ) commencing on 12 March 2014. The date that this policy was last updated is noted at the beginning of this policy and in the footer of each page of this policy.

####  **5. Personal Information Handling Practices**

#### 5.1 What we collect

We collect a range of personal information including:

  * correspondence;
  * finance records;
  * membership of ACARA’s working and reference groups, advisory and expert panels and Board members;
  * personnel records;
  * records of consultants and contractors;
  * student and parent data, collected in relation to the reporting of the National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy ( **NAPLAN** ) tests;
  * student and teacher personal information collected in relation to student and teacher work samples (click on the hyperlink for more detail);
  * student data, collected in relation to the National Assessment Program ( **NAP** ) Sample Assessments; and
  * subscriber and email lists (including e-newsletter and portal subscriber lists) (click on the hyperlink for more detail). 



#### 5.2 Collection

Under section 40 of the ACARA Act, we collect personal information only for purposes which are necessary for, and directly related to, any of the following three (3) purposes:

  * conducting research relating to the national school curriculum;
  * assisting government to formulate policies in relation to education matters; and
  * formulating national reports consisting of aggregated data on school performance.



In this policy, we refer to these purposes as **ACARA Authorised Purposes.**

We generally collect personal information directly from you. Student and parent data generally is collected from state and territory departments of education or state education authorities responsible for NAPLAN testing (called **Test Administration Authorities** ).

#### 5.3 Notification

If we collect personal information directly from you, we notify you at, or before, or as soon as practicable after, the time of collection.

Due to the number of schools involved, it will not be practicable for us to notify individuals when we collect personal information from the Test Administration Authorities.

#### 5.4 What we do with your personal information

We only use or disclose your personal information for purposes which are necessary for, and directly related to, any of the three ACARA Authorised Purposes.

What we use your personal information for depends on the purposes for which it was collected. Some of the ways in which we use your personal information are:

  * to assist us in operating our business (e.g. paying our accounts and managing staff);
  * to inform interested members of the public about our activities through our subscriber lists; and
  * to perform our functions under the ACARA Act, particularly “collect, manage and analyse student assessment data and other data relating to schools and comparative school performance”.



We use a customer relationship management system to assist us in operating our business. This database tracks our communications with stakeholders, including tracking letters, emails, phone calls, and contact information (for example, job title, organisation, email address and phone number).

Importantly, when we publish results of NAPLAN performance, we only publish results at an aggregated level (for example, school level, state level or national level). This means that we do not publish NAPLAN information that could identify a particular student. For example, ACARA publishes aggregated school-level NAPLAN performance data on the _My School_ website (<http://www.myschool.edu.au/>). We are particularly careful to ensure that, to the best of our ability, **no** personal information is published on this website. We achieve this in a number of ways, including: 

  * aggregating data per year level (3,5,7 and 9) for each school; and
  * imposing a business rule that where there are less than five (5) students in a cohort (year level), we do not publish this year level data on _My School_.



We do **not** give personal information about you, or your child, to third parties for direct marketing purposes.

#### 5.5 Use or disclosure for a secondary purpose

If ACARA holds personal information that was collected for a particular purpose (primary purpose), we will not use or disclose it for another purpose (secondary purpose) unless:

  * you have consented; or
  * you would reasonably expect that ACARA would use or disclose this information for the secondary purpose and the secondary purpose is:
  * if the personal information is sensitive information (such as information about an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation or criminal record), directly related to any of the three ACARA Authorised Purposes; or
  * if the personal information is not sensitive information, is related to any of the three ACARA Authorised Purposes; or
  * it is required or authorised by an Australian law; or
  * a permitted general situation exists (such as being necessary to lessen or prevent a serious threat to the life, health or safety of any individual, or to public health and safety); or
  * it is reasonably necessary for enforcement related activities conducted by, or on behalf of, an enforcement body. ** **



#### 5.5 Data security

We take steps to protect the personal information we hold against loss, unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure, and against other misuse. These steps include password protection for accessing our electronic IT system and securing paper files in locked cabinets. When the personal information that we collect is no longer required, we destroy or delete it in a secure manner, in accordance with ACARA’s administrative policy.

We host our own servers for all our document management systems. These servers are located in Australia. Our only public website which displays personal information is the Australian Curriculum website (<http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/>), which publishes student and teacher work samples. This website is hosted by Education Services Australia Limited ( **ESA** ). ESA is a national, not-for-profit company owned by all Australian education ministers.

We contract with a supplier for use of an IT system for managing third party materials licensed to us primarily for use in the National Assessment Program tests (server hosted in the United Kingdom). This system stores personal information relating to the licence owners. Our contract with this supplier includes a clause which protects the privacy of this personal information in accordance with the APPs.

####  **6. Your choices**

You can access the personal information that we hold about you, and you can ask us to correct the personal information we hold about you. If you are unhappy about the way we have handled your personal information, you can complain to us or the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner ( **OAIC** ). The OAIC generally prefers that you raise your complaint with us first. For more information, click on the following link, “Complaints regarding the handling of your personal information”. Our Privacy Officer will be able to assist you.

Personal information is **not** published on the _My School_ website. We hold state/territory government student identifiers as part of the NAPLAN data sets. However we are not able to match these identifiers with a particular student (this matching process is only able to be performed by state departments of education or state education authorities). If you believe that any student personal information is incorrect, you should contact your child’s school.

If you are listed on one or more of our subscriber email lists you can opt out at any time. You can unsubscribe by using the ‘unsubscribe’ option noted in our emails.

#### **1. Overview**

This Part A of our privacy policy provides you with more detail regarding how we handle your personal information. A summary of the other parts of our privacy policy can be found by clicking on the following link: Layered privacy policy.  
 

####  **2. Meaning of personal information**

In our privacy policy, 'personal information' has the same meaning as defined by [sub-section 6(1) of the Privacy Act](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013C00482/Html/Text#_Toc359487042). This definition has been amended and, commencing from 12 March 2014, is as follows:

“means information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable:

a.whether the information or opinion is true or not; and

b. whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not”.

####  **3. Australian Curriculum - Student and teacher work samples**

In relation to some student and teacher work samples published on the Australian Curriculum website, we do publish personal information identifying the student or teacher (including, but not limited to, photographs, sound recordings and film). This personal information is published on a public website. We obtain consent prior to publishing work samples on our website from: 

  * a parent or a legal guardian (where the student is less than 18 years of age); or
  * the student (where the student is 18 years of age or older); or
  * the teacher (where the personal information identifies the teacher),



for all work samples uploaded after 12 March 2014.

####  **4. Australian Curriculum - Student and teacher demonstration materials**

We may, from time to time, publish other material on the Australian Curriculum website containing personal information. This might include, for example, videos of students dancing, which demonstrate how dance can be taught in primary schools. We obtain similar privacy consents to those described above for student and teacher work samples.

####  **5. Unsolicited personal information**

It may be that we may obtain personal information about you that we have not requested (unsolicited personal information). For example:

  * you might send us your resume, without responding to a particular job advertisement; or
  * your name might be sent to us by a government agency as a person who might be interested in sitting on one of our reference groups or panels, without us requesting this information; or
  * your name might appear on a government document that has been passed onto us by another government agency, without us requesting this document.



Under the [Australian Privacy Principles](http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-resources/privacy-fact-sheets/other/privacy-fact-sheet-17-australian-privacy-principles), we are obliged to satisfy ourselves that we are authorised to collect this personal information. If we are **not** authorised to collect this personal information then we must destroy the document or de-identify the personal information. If we are authorised to collect this personal information, then our obligations with respect to your personal information are the same as if we had collected it ourselves.

####  **6. Email and portal subscriber lists**

We have a number of subscriber lists, including:

  * our e-newsletter (ACARA Update) email list, which stores information relating to subscribers that have an interest in our activities to enable the distribution of this e-newsletter; and
  * our portal subscriber lists, which store information relating to individual or group subscribers that have an interest in providing feedback on the Australian Curriculum, or school principals (or delegates) that check and provide information relevant to their school for publishing on the _My School_ website.



These records are kept indefinitely or until you choose to unsubscribe. If you are listed on our email (ACARA Update) list, you can opt out at any time. You can unsubscribe by using the ‘unsubscribe’ option noted in our emails. You can obtain access to your personal information stored on this subscriber list by contacting us.

####  **7. Your choices - Access and correction**

If you request access to the personal information we hold about you, or request that we change your personal information, we will allow access or make the changes unless we consider that there is a sound reason under the Privacy Act, _Freedom of Information Act 1982_ (Cth) or other relevant law to withhold the information, or not make the changes.

No personal information is published on the _My School_ website. We hold state/territory government student identifiers as part of the NAPLAN data sets. However we are not able to match these identifiers with a particular student (this matching process is only able to be performed by state departments of education or state education authorities). If you believe that any student personal information in relation to NAPLAN data is incorrect, you should contact your child’s school.

If we do not agree to provide access to your personal information or to amend or annotate the information we hold about you, then you may wish to: 

  * make a statement about your requested changes and we will attach this to your record; or
  * lodge a complaint with us: see below. 



####  **8. Complaints regarding the handling of your personal information**

If you are unhappy about the way we have handled your personal information, you can complain to us or the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner ( **OAIC** ). The OAIC generally prefers that you raise your complaint with us first. Our Privacy Officer will be able to assist you.

If you are dissatisfied with our investigation, you can complain to the OAIC who is independent of us. The Information Commissioner has the power to investigate complaints about possible breaches of the Privacy Act. The Information Commissioner can be contacted by email: [enquiries@oaic.gov.au](mailto:enquiries@oaic.gov.au) or by phone: 1300 363 992.
