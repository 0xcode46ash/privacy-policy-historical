# Privacy Policy | TransUnion SmartMove

SmartMove is firmly committed to respecting the consumer's right to privacy and has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our commitment.

## The lnformation We Collect from You

TransUnion SmartMove, a service of TransUnion Rental Screening Solutions ("TURSS"), allows you to provide third party access to your credit report, public record information, and related information ("Consumer Report Information") conveniently and affordably through our website. We collect your personal information only if you decide to provide third party access to your Credit Information. In order to process your transactions and provide you with quality customer service, we need your full name and current and/or billing address, your email address (so we can contact you) and, if you requested to pay for a third party's access to your Credit Information, a valid credit card number, your Social Security number and certain other personal information, such as your date of birth, address information, employment information, and certain credit card and loan account information. We use personal information to authenticate the credit card number and to confirm that the person requesting your credit report really is you and not an impostor or other person improperly seeking to access your information. 

## What Security Measures We Take

TURSS takes precautions to secure your personal information. If and when we ask you to provide your personal information, we will do so through a Web page that uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. This protocol provides security for your information by encrypting it as it travels from your computer to our computer. For security purposes we then move all of the personal information that we collect or obtain about you, including your credit report, to an environment on our proprietary network that has controls in place to limit access to and secure the data maintained therein.

## How We Use and Share Your Personal lnformation

Personal information that is shared with Third Parties will be monitored in accordance with our security and confidentiality policies. If you prefer not to receive promotional information, you may indicate your preference by contacting SmartMove when you register, place an order or update your account information, and TURSS will not send you any promotional materials.

## Emails

For SmartMove Landlords that are requested to pay for a third party's access to your Credit lnformation, we will email you a receipt of your purchase. Additionally, the SmartMove service will facilitate communication between you and the third party you agree to provide access to your Credit lnformationâ€”this communication will be provided both through the SmartMove Site and through emails. These emails are part of the SmartMove product and cannot be disabled.

## Ordering

When you agree to share your Credit Information, TURSS will share that information to identified third parties. TURSS must also share some of your personal information with third parties in order to process your transaction. For example, TURSS must share your name, address and social security number with one or more of the major credit reporting agencies in order to obtain your requested credit report, and must share your name, address and credit card account number with our credit card processing partner in order to process your payment. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

## Third Parties 

TURSS may disclose your personal information to third parties in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to comply with, or be responsive to, legal process served on us (such as a subpoena), or if we believe such disclosure is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of TURSS, our users or others. In addition, we may disclose your personal information to consultants, agents and advisors, such as attorneys and accountants, in the good faith belief that such disclosure is within the scope of their professional duties to TURSS and with the understanding that such professionals will abide by our security and confidentiality policies.

## The Collection of Anonymous Data

In order to enhance the usefulness of our website and our products and services, TURSS will collect data about our customers' use of our website, in a manner that does not include any personally identifiable information. While you browse the SmartMove website, we note which pages of our site you visit and note the IP address of your computer (as all websites do automatically), but we do not link that address information to your personal information. The general information we gather enables us to serve our customers better by continually enhancing our site based on up-to-date use patterns.

## Updating Your Personal Information 

You can correct or update at any time the personal information that you provided and that we maintain on you by accessing the SmartMove website and selecting "Account Preferences" from the Main Menu. TURSS is not responsible for and cannot amend the information in your credit report, which is produced by one or more credit reporting agencies. If you believe that some of the information in your credit report is inaccurate, you must contact the applicable credit reporting agency directly.

## Notification of Changes to this Privacy Statement

TURSS may amend this Privacy Statement at any time, but will notify users in advance of any material change, by posting a notice of the change in a prominent position on the home page of the SmartMove website. If the amendment would permit us to share your personal information with third parties in a manner materially different than described in this Privacy Statement, unless required by law or court order or in order to safeguard the operations of our site or our customers, you will be given an opportunity to inform us that you do not consent to such sharing of your personal information.

## Possible Acquisition

In the event of an acquisition of all or part of TURSS by another company, or in the event that TURSS were to sell or dispose of all or a part of the business, the acquirer would have access to the information maintained by the TURSS, which could include your personal information, subject to applicable law. The acquirer's privacy policy might be different than TURSS' privacy policy, or the acquirer might choose to amend TURSS' privacy policy. You will be notified by email if, as a result of such acquisition, TURSS' privacy policy is materially changed or if the acquirer's privacy policy is materially different than TURSS' privacy policy. In connection with such notice, you will be given an opportunity to inform the acquirer that you do not consent to the use or disclosure by the acquirer of your personal information in accordance with such new or revised privacy policy.
