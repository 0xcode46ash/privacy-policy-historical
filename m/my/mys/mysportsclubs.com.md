**Cookies  
** Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide you with additional Web site features.

The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether. However, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

Our site uses cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. For example, we might use a cookie to store the most recent parameters you used to search for a group fitness class so that you do not have to reenter that information the next time you do a search.
