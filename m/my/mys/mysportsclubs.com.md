# MySportsClubs | Privacy Policy

### Introduction

This privacy policy governs the information collection practices of Town Sports International's U.S. based sports clubs and websites (Town Sports), including: mysportsclubs.com, joinmysportsclubs.com, NYSC.com, bostonsportsclub.com, washingtonsports.com, philadelphiasports.com, joinnosweat.com, campaniesgetfit.com, and rockthescales.com. The policy below explains how Town Sports collects and uses your information, and when we share that information with third parties. By providing information to us, you agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy.

### Collection of Information

Guest and Member Registration Forms, Surveys, Sweepstakes and Contests

We collect personal information from you when you visit our clubs and websites, register as a guest or member, fill out a member or online profile, complete a survey, or participate in one of our sweepstakes, contests or other promotions.

We may collect the following information in connection with these activities:

  * name, address and phone numbers 
  * email address(es) 
  * user name, password and club membership number 
  * interests and preferences 
  * date of birth 
  * demographic information, including gender, marital status, and income level 
  * emergency contact information 
  * billing information 
  * employer name, address and phone number 
  * friend’s contact information to offer free guest memberships



Passive Information Collection Online

We automatically collect information online such as your Internet Service Provider and IP address, the pages that you visit, your browser type, your computer operating system, the site that you report having been referred from, and time of access. We store this information in a web server log. We use this information to improve your experience on our website and to aid in the diagnosis of website problems. Your IP address also is used to gather broad demographic information. For example, we might use your IP address to collect information concerning the most popular fitness classes for the clubs located within a particular geographic area.

We also collect information through "cookies." A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit one of our websites. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser and customize your experience. For example, we might use a cookie to store the most recent parameters you used to search for a group fitness class so that you do not have to reenter that information the next time you do a search. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.

Collection of Information from Children

We do not seek information directly from children. If you are under 13, you should not provide us with any information without the involvement of a parent or guardian. A parent or guardian may register a child age 14 or over to visit or join one of our clubs.

### How We Use Your Information

If you provide your personal information to us, we may use that information to service your membership, send you news, information or promotions related to our sports clubs or other products and services. In some instances, you may receive information or promotions about products or services offered by another company.

At any time you may choose to opt-out from receiving promotional materials from us. You can opt-out of receiving emails by clicking on an "opt-out" link provided at the bottom of an email that you receive from us, or by emailing our Customer Service Department at [memberservices@town-sports.com](mailto:memberservices@town-sports.com).

Third Parties

We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or companies except in the situations described below.

  * Subcontractors. From time to time we may share personal information with subcontractors or other unrelated third parties that provide us with services. These services may include, among other things, the creation or maintenance of our databases, or research and analysis concerning the people who request information from us. 
  * Law Enforcement. We fully cooperate with reasonable requests for information from law enforcement agencies. As a result, we reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful, or that we reasonably believe may aid a law enforcement investigation into unlawful activity. In addition, we reserve the right to release your information to law enforcement agencies if we determine, in our sole judgment, that either you have violated our policies, or the release of your information may protect the rights, property or safety of Town Sports, you, or one of our other customers. 
  * Sharing Your Information as Permitted by Law. We may share your personal information with others as required by, or permitted by, law. This may include sharing your personal information with governmental entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal process, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims against us. 
  * Transfers. In the unlikely event that Town Sports (or substantially all of its assets), or one of Town Sports’ clubs or websites is acquired, your personal information may be transferred to the acquiring company. In such a situation, you will be provided with notice that a transfer of your personal information has occurred. 
  * Demographic Information. As discussed above, we sometimes collect demographic information about our members and visitors. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.
