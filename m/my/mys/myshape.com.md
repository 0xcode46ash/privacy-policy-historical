# MyShape Customer Care Privacy Policy

Our privacy policy describes the practices that apply to the MyShape.com site, including, the information we collect about you, when and how we collect that information and what may happen to that information. We believe you should know as much as possible about our practices so that you can make an informed decision about the extent of your use of our site. MyShape.com will occasionally update its privacy statement to reflect company and customer feedback.

Except as described herein, we never sell or trade addresses with other companies, without your consent. Additionally, except as described herein, no personal information gathered via the MyShape registration process will be sold or shared with any third party without your consent. It is possible that the business or certain assets of MyShape (including intellectual property assets) could be sold which includes the sale of customer addresses and other personal information. If the buyer intends to continue the MyShape.com site to conduct business, or intends to honor the existing privacy policy, then such information will be sold without your consent. In all other cases (including sale of personal information to a buyer which will use such information for direct marketing purposes only), MyShape will seek your consent through email, giving you an opt out choice (for example, unless you check a box opting out by the stated deadline, you will be deemed to have consented and your personal information will be sold or shared with other companies for marketing purposes). Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, aggregate, non-personally identifiable information may be sold or shared with the press, advertisers, or suppliers (for example, buying or shopping habits of customers, that 70% of our users are women).
