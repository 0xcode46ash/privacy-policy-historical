# Privacy Policy

Percona does not share or sell contact information or email lists to anyone, and Percona will never spam you or cause you to be placed upon a spam list. Percona sends email only to persons who explicitly opt-in or who have business relationships with us. We do _not_ follow the common policy of assuming opt-in and requiring explicit opt-out, which we believe is disrespectful.

Percona's privacy policy is **not to collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information** except as follows:

  * Percona collects information only as required to fulfill the products or services requested by the user. For example, if a user requests to be contacted, Percona collects and stores the user's contact information.
  * Percona stores the information it collects on servers located in the United States of America.
  * Percona does not collect or store any credit card billing information. Instead, we delegate this sensitive task to a trusted servicing provider.
  * Percona shares information with third parties only as required to fulfill the requested products or services that Percona does not itself execute, e.g. processing credit card payments.
  * Percona uses cookies only to store site preferences and session identifiers, such as your session when you log into our customer service portal. Site preference cookies are used to remember your requests, such as asking not to see a contact request form when downloading software or white papers. Such cookies are used only to enhance your user experience, not to track or record information about you.
  * Percona keeps standard HTTP server logs of website requests to assist in diagnosing site problems and other troubleshooting and analysis tasks.
  * Percona uses Google Analytics to help measure website usage, and Google Adwords to help make users aware of our products and services through advertisements on the Internet. Google places cookies on your computer to accomplish this, and may use cookies placed on your computer while you browse Percona's website.



To opt out of any of the above:

  * Remember that Percona's own practice is not to store, collect, or share information about you unless you opt in explicitly. If you have not requested us to perform any services for you, then you are not opted in to any type of data collection or storage.
  * We never share or sell your information for others to market to you, so there is no need to opt out of third-party marketing.
  * If you wish to opt out of our newsletter mailings, please follow the opt-out link at the bottom of any message, and your email will be placed into a do-not-mail list so we don't send any newsletters to you again.
  * If you wish to opt out of Google's use of cookies to serve advertisements to you, please browse to [Google's advertising opt-out page](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).
