# mySupermarket - Privacy policy

**Protecting You**

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998).

We collect information about you to provide you with the best possible service and to provide you with related services and marketing from ourselves (but not from third parties without your consent).

**The Information We Require**

Our privacy policy ensures that any information you provide us remains private and secure. To reassure you, below we provide details of the information you provide to us, and how it will, and more importantly, will not be used. We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. The information we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check the information that we hold about you by contacting us (and there may be an administrative fee payable for this). If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly.

Here are some examples of the data we collect and reasons why:

  * When you start using the Service, you are asked to provide your postcode for delivery - this allows us to identify which supermarkets deliver in your area. 
  * When you register you are asked to provide your name, email address and password - this helps us recognise you when you return so that we can provide you with a faster service. 
  * We keep a record of items you purchased in your favourites list, thus allowing you to shop more quickly on future visits. 
  * We keep a record of the contents of your trolley between shopping sessions. This allows you to continue shopping sessions that you may have stopped midway with no need to add again all the items that you already placed in your trolley. 
  * We keep a record of your preferences such as sorting order of items and last shelf you bought in, so you don't need to reset these preferences every time you start shopping. 
  * We keep track of your emails and contacts with customer support, so that we can provide you with a responsive and efficient service. 
  * If you import favourites from one of the Supermarkets or if you book a delivery slot from one of the Supermarkets or when you place an order with the Supermarkets (using the Service), we ask you to enter your login details for that Supermarket (usually email and password). Supermarket password access details are never saved (other than for the duration of one browsing session) and are not used for any other purposes. (Please note that we do keep details of your favourites from Supermarkets and details of previous trolleys you have ordered so that we can better display your favourite items to you as part of the Service.) 



We collect and track statistical non-personal information about shopping habits, goods and service preferences and selections which customers have made and the likes for the purpose of business research and for the general improvement of the Service.

**We will never sell or rent your personal data to anyone else for their marketing purposes without your consent.**

**E-mails we send you**

Please note that we may e-mail for the following purposes: 

  * as part of the Service. We send emails to you after registration, notifying you of your registration details and we also send emails to you after you have sent a trolley, giving you details about that.
  * to offer related services to you. However, in terms of any marketing emails we may send, we will always give you the chance to opt-out (or unsubscribe) from any marketing email from us in the future.



**Security**

The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the law. For example, we hold your Service password (which is allocated as part of the registration process and as may be later changed) using secure encryption. **And we do not save or keep a record in any form of any password you may use when using websites of Supermarkets** ( **other than during your existing browser session** )- that is why you must key that password in, each time you re-access our Website through a different browser session when you want to go to a Supermarket website to which you may be linked as part of the Service. See our [Security section](https://web.archive.org/Administration/Security.aspx) for more details.

**Technology**

We use "cookies", technology to store data in your computer using the functionality of your browser. A lot of websites do this, because cookies allow the website publisher to do useful things like find out whether the computer (and probably its user) has visited the site before.

You can usually modify your browser to prevent cookie use - but if you do this the Service (and the Website) will not work properly. The information stored in the cookie is used to identify you. This enables us to operate an efficient service and to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to the website.

**This Privacy Policy**

Please note that this Privacy Policy forms part of the [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/Administration/TermsAndConditions.aspx) for use of this Website and forms part of the Agreement between you and us. The terms defined in those [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/Administration/TermsAndConditions.aspx) are used in the same way in this Privacy Policy.

**Questions or Comments?**

If you have any further questions about our privacy policy, please refer to our [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/Administration/TermsAndConditions.aspx) or contact our [Customer Support](https://web.archive.org/Administration/ContactUs.aspx).
