## HOW DO WE HANDLE CHILDREN’S PRIVACY CONCERNS?

Myxer does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on any Myxer website from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our websites is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Myxer websites or services at any time or in any manner. If Myxer learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Myxer websites without verified parental consent, then Myxer will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. 

## WHEN AND HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?

Myxer™ does not sell, rent, or share your personal information to anyone unless you consent to provide such information. Myxer™ may disclose relevant information about our customers to our contractors (e.g. a customer service contractor or a credit card clearing service) in order for them to provide specific services for Myxer™, and to better serve our customers. Myxer™' contractors are bound by strict contractual requirements to keep all personal information they process strictly confidential and to use such information solely on behalf of Myxer™. Also, Myxer™ may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

(a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Myxer™;  
(b) protect and defend the rights or property of Myxer™ and its products; or   
(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Myxer™ products or the public at large.

Please visit the privacy policies of these sites in order to understand their privacy policies and data collection practices. 

## CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY

We frequently revise this Privacy Policy to keep it up to date with Myxer™ products, services and web pages. 

## NO ERROR FREE PERFORMANCE

We customarily release alpha and beta versions of our products, which are further refined before the release of the final version. Because these products are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome feedback on any privacy concerns you may have, and on how to improve our products generally, in all stages of release. Myxer™ does not guarantee error-free performance under this privacy policy. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this privacy policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with our privacy policy. Myxer™ shall not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of the United States. 

If you have questions about the privacy aspects of our products or services or would like to make a complaint, please contact: [support@myxertones.com](mailto:support@myxertones.com)
