# WOT - Privacy

Your privacy is very important to us. The WOT add-on collects information only for computing website reputations and for preventing abuse of our service. Any information that is no longer needed for either purpose is deleted. 

##  What information do we collect? 

The add-on uses cookies to authenticate itself to the My WOT portal. Cookies don’t store any personally identifying information such as your name or email address. You can also disable the cookies from the add-on preferences if you prefer. When loading reputations for the websites you visit, the add-on sends to our service only the encrypted host name, and any testimonies you may choose to give. The information about visited domains is stored only temporarily for computing reputations. 

If you choose to register on the My WOT portal, we require some personal information. We ask for your email address, a user name, and a password, which you can choose yourself. That’s all the information required to use the portal. The information is stored in a secure database and your password is processed so it cannot be recovered. 

All the stored information, except for the testimonies of course, is deleted after one month. We don't keep a lasting record of user information regarding the usage of the add-on. 

##  Why do we collect information? 

The information we collect when you install the WOT add-on is used to identify you as a unique user. Without this information we would not be able to rely on your testimonies, and therefore, could not serve our users as well as possible. The information the My WOT portal collects is used for your convenience. If you e.g. forget your password, we can help you create a new one and guide you through this via email.
