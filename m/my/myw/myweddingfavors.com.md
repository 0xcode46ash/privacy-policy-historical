Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the internet’s vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence. 

We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how My Wedding Favors collects information from all end users of My Wedding Favors' internet services (the "Services") — those who access some of our Services but do not make a purchase ("Visitors") as well as those who make a purchase ("Customers") — what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Customers have concerning the collection and use of such information. My Wedding Favors requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully. 

**Introduction**

My Wedding Favors collects information in different ways from Visitors and customers who access the various parts of our Services. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Services and, generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases described below.

My Wedding Favors collects the following information for purposes of placing an order: name, address, email address, and credit card information. This information allows us to know who and where to ship products to, allows us to email an order confirmation and tracking numbers, and allows us to process the order.

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, or remove it by emailing our Customer Support at info@myweddingfavors.com or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

**Data Security**

The membership, bookstore and donations information you provide—including credit card information—is secured using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. We use this SSL technology to prevent such information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted over the Internet. The encrypted data goes to a secure site where your information is stored on restricted-access computers located at restricted-access sites. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information. Our store is a Yahoo Store, hosted by Yahoo, one of the world's largest providers of secure e-commerce solutions. Please follow the link above for more information on Yahoo's policies.

We use other third parties to provide a newsletter on our site. When you sign up for our "Friends List" newsletter, we will share your name and email as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose, other than allowing us to use their services to send the newsletters to your email address.
