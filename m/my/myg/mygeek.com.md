This information is primarily used to identify the account and correspond to the account holder in regard to payments, credits, problems and questions. Credit Card information is provided to credit card processors for the sole purpose of verifying that the credit card is valid and to authorize purchases or to administer refunds to cancelled accounts. Secondary uses of the information provided are to assist myGeek.com staff in detecting and tracking any potential fraud.

Any notes, ideas, suggestions, or other material submitted by Users becomes the property of myGeek.com. 

myGeek.com may run contests where we ask Users for contact information such as e-mail or physical addresses. myGeek.com may retain a third party company to oversee the collection and correct entry of User's contact information. The aforementioned third party company will also supply and oversee distribution of prizes for such contests.

Unsupervised Children  
Children 18 and under are not eligible to use myGeek.com services without the participation and supervision of a legal parent or guardian. myGeek.com is not a site meant for children, and we do not provide privacy measures designed to protect children when using the Internet unsupervised.

Expunging Your Information From Our Records  
You may e-mail CustomerService at myGeek.com or use one of the alternate contact methods listed below to remove your contact information from our database provided we have completed all your pending transactions. Please note, however, that information is never completely removed from our history and disaster recovery archives. 

Disclosure of Information to Third Parties 

Personal Information  
myGeek.com does not sell, trade, rent, or release your personal information to third parties in ways that are not disclosed in the privacy statement. If we were to ever do so, you will have the opportunity to opt-out beforehand. 

Transactional Information  
myGeek.com transactional information such as traffic patterns, sales, aggregate data regarding general shopping patterns, and other site information may be shared with vendors and other reputable third parties. This data will never contain any identifiable personal information of myGeek.com Users. For example, we might share statistics on how many customers purchased a specific product, but we will not specifically disclose who purchased the product. 

Legal Issues  
myGeek.com discloses personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary for the following: 

  * To conform to the edict of the law or comply with a legal process served on myGeek.com or its Web site. 
  * To protect and defend the property rights of myGeek.com, the myGeek.com Web site, or that of myGeek.com Users. 
  * Or to act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of myGeek.com Users, employees, or the general public. 



Other Sites' Policies  
myGeek.com has no control over, nor does it bear any of the responsibility for the privacy policies and/or content of any sites or advertisers linked to or on our site. myGeek.com also takes no responsibility for the cookies these sites or advertisers might deposit on your hard drive. 

Safety and Security 

Security  
After we receive the data at myGeek.com, it is stored on a secure server behind a firewall and cannot be accessed from outside the company. All data is secure and is protected from alteration, loss or misuse. The myGeek.com employees who process your order are the only people with access to your personal information. All myGeek.com employees sign a privacy/security policy agreement, which provides legal confidentiality protections for all myGeek.com Users. Any violation of this policy results in disciplinary action, including possible termination, criminal prosecution, and civil action. 

When our registration/order form asks Users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), the information you provide is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, you will know that you are on a secure page because the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer is in its locked form, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, protect all user-information off-line. For example, all of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is subject to restricted use in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

Your Consent
