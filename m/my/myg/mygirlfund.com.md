MGF gives you the option of using a secure transmission method for sending such information.

MGF receives and stores all information that you enter in our Website and billing pages. In addition, MGF collects information about you during your visit, such as your IP Address, and MGF employs its software in order to ascertain your physical location when making a purchase. Additionally, when becoming a Member of the Website, MGF uses an outside service to verify that you are over 18 years old. You are required to provide MGF with accurate and up-to-date information, and failure to provide MGF with such information could result in voiding your Agreement with MGF.

You can inquire about your personal data by sending an e-mail to customerservice@MyGirlFund.com. Within a week, MGF shall provide you with a readable copy of the personal data which MGF keeps about you. MGF charges a $25 processing fee for the request.
