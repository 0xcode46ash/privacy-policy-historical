## Internet Protocol Addresses

Your computer uses Internet Protocol or "IP" addresses every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. Our server automatically collects IP addresses. Mygazines will not use your IP address to attempt to personally identify you.

## Referrers

A "referrer" is the information passed along by a Web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically collected by our Web server. This information is collected and used by Mygazines to understand the Web sites referring traffic to our Web site and to present appropriate content to our potential customers. Mygazines tabulates referrer information on an aggregate basis to identify trends and traffic patterns. 

Mygazines may enter into agreements with content partners that require Mygazines to count the number of product downloads stemming from a referral from a content partner site. This information is collected, used and aggregated by Mygazines to fulfill the reporting requirements of those agreements. This information may also be combined with the referrer information described above and tabulated on an aggregate basis to identify general trends and traffic patterns. 

## Other

Mygazines may automatically receive and record information in our server logs or from our cookie-based tracking service from your browser, including your IP address, your computer's name, the type and version of your Web browser, referrer addresses and other generally accepted tracking information. We may also record Web site page views (hit counts) and other general statistical and tracking information that is aggregated with that of other users in order to understand how our Web site and Mygazines Digital Editions are being used.
