# FOIA Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting the U.S. Department of Agriculture website and reviewing our privacy statement. Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us. 

Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website:   
  
| Information Collected and Stored Automatically  
  
| 

If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit: 

1\. The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "your school.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website; 

2\. The type of browser and operating system used to access our site; 

3\. The date and time you access our site; 

4\. The pages you visit; and 

5\. If you linked to the U.S. Department of Agriculture website from another website, the address of that website. 

We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors - to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors are using. We do not track or record information about individuals and their visits.   
  
| Cookies  
  
| 

When you visit some websites, their web servers generate pieces of information known as cookies. Some cookies collect personal information to recognize your computer in the future. This is not the case at USDA.gov, where we only use non-persistent cookies or "per-session cookies." These cookies do not collect personal information on users and they are erased as soon as you leave our website. 

Per-session cookies serve technical purposes, like providing seamless navigation through USDA.gov. These cookies do not permanently record data and they are not stored on your computer's hard drive. USDA.gov's cookies are stored in memory and are only available during an active browser session. Again, once you close your browser, the cookie disappears.   
  
| You Send Us Personal Information  
  
| 

If you choose to provide us with personal information, as in an e-mail to the Secretary or someone else or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it to us through our website, we use that information to respond to your message and to help us locate for you the information you have requested. We treat e-mails the same way that we regard letters sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We are required to maintain many documents under the Presidential Records Act for historical purposes, but we do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to you. We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. Moreover, we do not create individual profiles with the information you provide or give it to any private organizations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture does not collect information for commercial marketing.   
  
| When You Visit USDA Agency/Staff Office Websites  
  
| 

Please read the USDA Agency/Staff Office Privacy Statement when you visit those websites. Where necessary, an Agency/Staff Office may have additional privacy criteria, conditions, or information that you should know.   
  
| Links to Other Sites  
  
| 

Our website has links to many other federal agencies. In a few cases we link to private organizations, with their permission. Once you access another site through a link that we provide you are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.

| Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)  
  
| 

The E-Government Act requires that agencies conduct privacy impact assessments for electronic information systems and collections and, in general, make them publicly available. 

A PIA is an analysis of how information is handled: (i) to ensure handling conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements regarding privacy, (ii) to determine the risks and effects of collecting, maintaining and disseminating information in identifiable form in an electronic information system, and (iii) to examine and evaluate protections and alternative processes for handling information to mitigate potential privacy risks.

| Machine-Readable Privacy Policies (P3P)  
  
| 

The Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002 require agencies to have both a 'human readable' Privacy Policy and machine readable technology that automatically alerts users about whether site privacy practices match their personal privacy preferences. P3P is the standard for machine-readable Privacy Policy.
