**Privacy Statement**

Protecting your privacy is important to us. The following statement is intended to help you understand how InteliSpend Prepaid Solutions, a Blackhawk Network Business ("InteliSpend", "we", "us"), collects, uses, and safeguards confidential information as well as any personally identifiable information ("PII") you provide to us on our websites and web-based applications ("Our Websites") and the ways that you can access and correct your PII.

Please note that Our Privacy Statement does not address the privacy or information practices of any third parties. InteliSpend cannot, and does not, assume responsibility for the policies, practices and actions of any third parties. Third party vendors under contract with InteliSpend to provide certain support services are required to safeguard PII.

**Summary**

PII is information about an individual by which the identity of that individual could be deduced, such as residential address and telephone number, e-mail address, transaction records and other personal information. PII does not include name, position or title, business address or business telephone number. PII also excludes specified publicly available information, such as that listed in a telephone directory.

Non-Identifiable Information ("NII") is information that cannot be associated with a particular individual. This includes web-traffic information that is collected and analyzed in the aggregate.

InteliSpend sells products directly to businesses and consumers and InteliSpend provides customer support directly to those individuals that have received InteliSpend products. InteliSpend uses the PII collected to provide services (e.g., to recognize you when you return to this Website, save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts); process your orders; complete your transactions; respond to your requests; deliver the products and services you request or for which you apply; notify you of account or product/service updates; prevent fraud; and as required to provide services that support our products.

In addition to PII, InteliSpend also gathers NII about visitors to Our Websites and uses NII to identify preferences and provide relevant products and services.

**Company Commitment to Privacy**

InteliSpend is actively involved with current industry initiatives to preserve individual privacy rights on the Internet and in all aspects of electronic commerce. This Internet Privacy Statement is currently applicable only to our United States and Canadian clients, card recipients and visitors to Our Websites. InteliSpend respects the privacy of your PII and undertakes to comply with applicable privacy legislation in these jurisdictions. InteliSpend makes no representation that Our Websites are governed by, or operated in accordance with, the laws of other nations, or that Our Websites or any part thereof, are appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access Our Websites do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local rules, regulations and laws. 

**Consent**  
Your access and use of Our Websites signifies your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your PII in the manner described in this Privacy Statement, as amended from time to time. InteliSpend may revise this Privacy Statement, without notice, by updating this webpage. Your continued use of Our Websites after any revisions are made, constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Statement. Please check this webpage for the most current version of the Privacy Statement.

**Types of Information Collected on Our Websites**

When you become a registered user of any of Our Websites, and enroll in online products or services provided by InteliSpend, you voluntarily provide us with information such as your name, address, credit card number, e-mail address and telephone number.

Becoming a registered Web user enables you to review confidential account information for the order(s) placed specific to your account. Such transactions are protected by usernames and passwords and/or card account information.

You should keep your password, username, and credit card account information confidential. After you have become a registered Web user, we may obtain additional information, such as your usage of Our Websites, and your usage of the other InteliSpend online services in which you enroll.

We also use PII collected from card recipients (including contact information, username and password, personal identification numbers or "PIDs", card account information and transaction history)to respond to inquiries, monitor balances and prevent fraud.

Whether or not you are a registered Web user, if you purchase or apply for InteliSpend products or services offered on Our Websites, we may request that you provide your name and address, telephone number, e-mail address, and other information in order to provide the product or service to you or to process your application for the product or service.

**How We Use Information**

We use the PII and NII collected on Our Website to process transactions you conduct on Our Websites, and to process applications and deliver the products and services you enroll in, or for which you apply. To do this, it is often necessary to share this information with carefully selected third-party service providers and business partners with whom we work, such as companies that manage accounts and companies that perform customer support services or other business operations for us. If you use Our Websites, we reserve the right to share your PII with such third-parties for the purpose of enabling these third parties to provide such services to us. We take reasonable steps to ensure these third parties treat PII in a manner comparable to our own practices. 

Information collected by us may be stored and processed in the United States, the Philippines, or in any other country in which we or our service providers maintain facilities, and by using Our Websites you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Be advised that PII may be made available, without your knowledge, to the United States government or its agencies, or those of governments in any other country where we or our service providers store or process PII, under a lawful order made in that country.

We also use PII and NII collected via Our Websites, together with information we have about you, publicly available information, and preferences you indicate, to customize your online experience and to provide you with more relevant offers and updates.

To inquire or change your preference information, contact us at the following:

· American Express: 888-900-2347

· Discover: 888-842-0336 (U.S.); 801-744-9918 (outside U.S.)

· MasterCard: 888-371-2109 (U.S.); 339-234-6415 (outside U.S.)

· Visa: 877-610-1075 (U.S. and Canada); 801-214-8892 (outside U.S. and Canada)

**How We Use Your E-mail Address**

We may use your e-mail address to send you the following types of e-mail messages:

§ Service notifications related to your account(s).

§ Occasional updates about our products and services.

§ Promotional offers as requested through an "opt in" request.

§ Regularly scheduled e-mail newsletters related to the InteliSpend products or services in which you are or have been enrolled.

Unless specifically and clearly disclosed on a Web site into which you opt-in, we will not share your e-mail address with other companies for them to market their products or services to you. When we hire vendors to deliver e-mails to you on our behalf, they cannot use your e-mail address for any other purpose. To make our e-mail offers more relevant to you, we may use information you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys and from information we have already gathered about you.

You may choose to opt-out of the transfer of your e-mail address to third parties as described below.

When we send e-mail to you, we may be able to identify information about your e-mail address, such as whether you can view graphic-rich HTML e-mail. If your e-mail address is HTML-enabled, we may choose to send you graphic-rich HTML e-mail messages. Also, when you receive an e-mail offer from InteliSpend, we record whether or not you "click through" to view the e-mail, content attached, and respond to the offer.

**Accepting and Declining E-mail Offers**

Although we intend to only send you notice of carefully designed opportunities, we recognize the importance of providing you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by simply opting out.

· By opting out, you request InteliSpend, and vendors on our behalf, not send you e-mail communications concerning opportunities. However, as we will occasionally need to send you certain e-mail messages that are important to your use of Our Websites, we retain the right to provide service updates to you via e-mail. Because this information may be important to your use of Our Websites, or may contain notice of changes to your profile or preferences, you will not be able to opt out of receiving such messages.

· By opting-in, you a) request InteliSpend and vendors on our behalf, send carefully designed e-mail communications about opportunities and service offers to you at the e-mail address you provide, or b) to receive offers from the business partner clearly disclosed in the opt-in section of Our Website(s).

**NII**

When you browse Our Websites and have not signed in for any online service from InteliSpend, PII, such as your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, is not collected. However, we track how Our Websites are used by anonymous visitors as well as registered customers and cardholders. InteliSpend uses WebTrends On-Demand service to collect and analyze our web traffic data.Click here to read the WebTrends Privacy Policy.

Cookies - A cookie is a piece of information stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser, which will allow Our Websites to recognize your computer's browser as a previous visitor and to access NII relating to your last visit. In addition, Our Websites may also set a "session cookie" which helps us administer Our Websites. The session cookie expires when you close your browser and does not retain any information about you after it expires. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but if you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you can usually change your browser settings to prevent automatic acceptance. If you choose not to accept cookies, you may still use most of the features of Our Websites, however you may not be able to use certain services (e.g., those applications that require you to log-in to access).

**"Do Not Track" Preferences**

Many browsers provide you an option to request that a web application disable either its tracking and/or cross-site user tracking of an individual user. We do not track your online activities across different Sites, and we only track your activity within a Site to the extent you log into your account, in order to enhance our services. We do not use information we obtain regarding your activity on our Sites to target advertisements to you or to provide information to third parties. Our third-party service providers do not obtain PII from your use of our Sites. Therefore, our practices remain the same whether or not you enable the "Do Not Track" feature.

**Security**

Some of our websites may require that you provide us with confidential or sensitive information. Before this data is transmitted, these sites will first establish a "secure session" using SSL. SSL technology encodes information as it is being sent over the Internet between your computer and our systems, helping to ensure that the information remains confidential. For further information about SSL and how we safeguard information data transmission over the Internet, please read our Security Q & A below.

Your browser will contain an indicator of whether or not you are transmitting data in a secure session. For example, a key or lock symbol may appear in the bottom bar to indicate you are visiting a secure site. Refer to your browser's help feature to find out more about how your browser indicates that a secure session has been established.

InteliSpend realizes how important security is to you, and we take seriously our responsibility to protect the information you may provide us over the Internet.

You should be aware that e-mail is not a completely secure channel of communication at present. Please do not use e-mail to send us personal and other sensitive information such as account numbers, social security numbers, PIN numbers, mother's maiden name, or passwords. Further, we will not request you provide this sensitive data over e-mail without a secure transmission available.

We are continually seeking technical solutions to assure the confidentiality and security of all the information you provide to us online and take reasonable precautions to keep the information that we collect secure, including organizational, physical and electronic precautions. We will keep you informed on Our Websites when we implement significant new safety enhancements. However, it is important to note that, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and information transmitted over the Internet could be intercepted by third parties. As such, we do not assume any liability for the theft, loss, misuse or alteration of any information transmitted over the Internet.

**Security Q & A**

**Q. Is my information secure?**

**A.** Whenever InteliSpend asks you to send confidential or sensitive information over the Internet, such as card numbers, ID and Passwords, we require that a "higher security session" using SSL first be established.

**Q. What specifically is SSL?**

**A.** Any time you access or supply card account or confidential or sensitive information in one of our secure online areas, that information is encrypted by a technology called Secure Socket Layer, often abbreviated as SSL. SSL technology secretly encodes information as it is being sent over the Internet between your computer and InteliSpend systems, helping to ensure that the information remains confidential. The use of SSL requires two components: a SSL-compatible browser and a web server to perform the "key-exchange" that establishes an SSL connection to InteliSpend web server systems.

**Q. When do I enter into a "secure SSL session?"**

**A.** Secure SSL sessions are established in InteliSpend online service areas where customers are providing any type of ordering information online or are providing any type of card-related information (card number, card valid thru, and card security identification number) or other confidential or sensitive information online. 

**Q. Why do I need an ID and password?**

**A.** InteliSpend requires the use of an ID and password as an additional security measure that helps protect your information.

**Underage Users**

Our Websites are not directed toward children (individuals under 19 years of age). InteliSpend does not permit registration or use of Our Websites by anyone under the age of 19, and we do not knowingly collect PII from children. In particular, if you are under 19 years of age, you should exit Our Websites and not provide PII to any site on the Internet without the knowledge and permission of your parent or guardian.

**Retention of Your PII**

When your PII is no longer required for the purposes set out above, we will destroy this information or render this information non-identifiable (that is, alter the information so that it cannot be traced back to, or associated with, a specific individual).

**Access to Your PII**

You are entitled to access, verify, amend and/or correct your PII. Upon request to our Privacy Officer (see contact information below), we will provide you with access to the PII we have collected about you through Our Websites (unless the release of this information is prohibited by law).

If you have a concern regarding the collection, use or disclosure of your PII by InteliSpend, please contact our Privacy Officer at:

privacy@intelispend.com

Your concern will be investigated and you will be notified within 30 days of the outcome of the investigation and any action required as a result.

**Offline Practices**

Please note, this Privacy Statement applies solely to our online information gathering and disclosure practices in connection with Our Websites, and does not apply to any offline operations. 

This Privacy Statement, as amended from time to time, has been adopted by InteliSpend as of January 1, 2014.
