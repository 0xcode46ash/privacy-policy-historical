We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you.

The Site may collect certain information about your visit, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to the Site.

In support of these uses, MyPengo.com may use personal information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the Site and any related MyPengo.com products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your particular preference or interests.

We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications. We may additionally send you information about other MyPengo.com products and services. 

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. As described in this policy, we do, however, share your information with our affiliates and, under certain circumstances, with third parties that provide services on our behalf or with whom we have partnered to offer a particular product or service. 

MyPengo.com may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on MyPengo.com or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of MyPengo.com and our family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of MyPengo.com employees or agents, users of MyPengo.com products or services, or members of the public.

In the unlikely event of a sale of some or all of our business, MyPengo.com will disclose your personal information to a purchaser that agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Statement. 

COOKIES 

We use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of the registration process and to personalize the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other web sites you visit. 

LINKS 

The Site may contain links to other web- or wapsites. We do not control such other web- and wapsites and are not responsible or liable for the availability thereof or the content, advertising, products or other materials contained on such sites. We shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss incurred or suffered by any user in connection therewith. Your access and use of linked sites, including the content therein, is solely at your own risk. 

THE CHOICES YOU HAVE 

You can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be required to take advantage of MyPengo.com’s features and services. 

You can add or update certain personal information. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records. 

If you do not want to receive promotional information, e-mails or other mail from us or our partners, please info@mypengo.com. 

You can remove personal information that you have provided to us. Deleting your information will delete the data only in our database for purposes of managing future communications from us and third parties. These deletions will not delete information already collected that may have already been shared with third parties, all as provided above in this Privacy Statement. You will need to contact third parties that may contact you directly to delete your personal information that they may be using to contact you. 

SECURITY 

Protecting your information is important to us. We use the industry standard technology to protect the security of your information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet and via mobile communications networks can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we are committed to protecting your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or through us.

For material changes to this Privacy Statement, we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice on the home page of our web site or by directly sending you a notification.
