#### Information Collection

MyPizza.com collects information volunteered by consumers when they register and place orders on our Web site. The information we collect through registration and order placement is used to provide the services specified on our Website. From time to time, we may solicit additional personal and demographic information, for market research purposes, in the form of surveys or polls. Participation in market research surveys by our customers is entirely optional and at their discretion. We also store information such as page views, computer IP addresses, and other statistics in the form of logs. These logs are used solely to enhance the technical performance of our Website.

#### Website Registration

MyPizza.com collects a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and about Website users. Much of the Personally-Identifying Information collected by MyPizza.com about users is information provided by users themselves at the time they register with the Website and purchase food. That information may include each user's name, address, email address, and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender, age, date of birth, username, hometown and other demographic information, and other relevant information as determined by MyPizza.com from time to time. Users of the Website are under no obligation to provide MyPizza.com with Personally-Identifying Information of any kind, with the caveat that a user's refusal to do so may prevent the user from using certain Website features.

BY REGISTERING WITH OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS "WEBSITE REGISTRATION" SECTION.

#### Online Forums and Public Postings; Other Collections

Certain Personally-Identifying Information collected from users is disclosed as a matter of course as a result of those users' use of the Website. We provide areas on our Websites where you can post information and reviews about restaurants. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. USERS ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER HARM RESULTING FROM THEIR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.

#### MyPizza.com Communications

We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by the Website that we think you may find valuable. We may also send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. Generally, you may opt out of such emails at the time of registration or through your account settings, though we reserve the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.

Our customer service representatives may use your telephone number and E-mail address to notify you of the status of your order as necessary and appropriate. MyPizza.com reserves the right to use the information collected to send special offers on behalf of third party partners or vendors (including Restaurants) participating in our service. However, we do not share your information with the Restaurant other than the information necessary to conduct business as stated above.

#### Notices of Violations of Website Terms of Use and Other Communications Directed to MyPizza.com

By submitting a copyright infringement notification under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) (explained further in our Infringement Policy) or other communication (including communications about content stored on or transmitted through the Website) you consent to have such communication forwarded to the person or entity who stored, transmitted or linked to the content addressed by your communication, in order to facilitate a prompt resolution. For notices of violations of our Terms of Use or other communications (but not DMCA copyright infringement notifications), upon request MyPizza.com will edit out your name and contact information. However, DMCA copyright infringement notifications (including any personally identifiable information set forth in the notifications) will be forwarded as submitted to MyPizza.com without any deletions.

#### Information Sharing

In order to process your order, we must share the following information every time you place an order with a Restaurant: your name, delivery address (if applicable), food order, and credit card information (if applicable). We also share your telephone number so the Restaurant may optionally verify that the order is not fraudulent. We restrict this information flow to only the bare minimum elements required to prepare and fulfill your orders. Occasionally, we may voluntarily share, sell or rent aggregated (non-personal) market research data with third party partners and vendors. This information does not contain personally identifiable information and is shared for the purposes of enhancing our service. We may present offers to you on behalf of third party partners. If you accept an offer, we will share your name, address and credit card information with this third party. We will not share this information without your consent.

#### Disclosures

MyPizza.com will disclose Personally-Identifying Information under the following circumstances: 

  * • By Law or to Protect Rights. When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of MyPizza.com, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements or policies, in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
  

  * • Direct mail partners. From time to time we may share our postal mailing list with selected providers of goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive mailings from these providers, you may opt-out at the time you register for our Website, or at any time thereafter by going to your account settings or contacting us using the contact information below.
  

  * • Marketing Communications. Unless users opt-out from receiving MyPizza.com marketing materials upon registration, MyPizza.com will email users about products and services that MyPizza.com believes may be of interest to them and MyPizza.com also will provide users' email information to third parties, so that those third parties may directly contact users about additional products and services. If a user wishes to opt-out of receiving marketing materials from MyPizza.com or having their email information provided to third parties at any time after registration, users may do so by going to your account settings or contacting us using the contact information below. Even after opting-out, a user may continue to receive marketing emails from third parties to whom MyPizza.com already has provided the user's email information. Users will be responsible for directly contacting such third parties to request cessation of further marketing emails.
  

  * • Restaurants. Whenever a user places an order for food from a restaurant, MyPizza.com will transfer all information to the restaurant necessary for preparing and processing the order. On occasion, this may include transferring credit card and other payment information in cases where a restaurant, rather than MyPizza.com, is processing the payment. Users will need to contact restaurants directly to determine the privacy policies that apply to the information that MyPizza.com transfers to the restaurants.
  

  * • Third Party Service Providers. We may share your Personally-Identifying Information, which may include your name and contact information (including email address) with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our Website. We may also share your name, contact information and credit card information with our authorized service providers who process credit card payments. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purpose.
  

  * • Business Transfers; Bankruptcy. MyPizza.com reserves the right to transfer all Personally-Identifying Information in its possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of MyPizza.com assets. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred Personally-Identifying Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are given notice of that new privacy policy and are given an opportunity to affirmatively opt-out of it. Personally-Identifying Information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor organization.



#### E-mail/Anti-Spam Information

MyPizza.com does not purchase bulk E-mail addresses nor do we use the services of bulk E-mail companies for promoting our service. This means we will not distribute, sell or rent your E-mail address to any third party. Moreover, our E-mail servers do not relay E-mail destined for non-local domains.

#### Use of Cookies

We use "cookies" (small text files stored in your internet browser) to enhance your ordering experience. Cookies allow Web site users to order faster and more efficiently by storing information such as your location, order information and personal preferences. We do not use cookies to track your surfing habits and activities outside of our Web site. Cookies can be easily and safely deleted from your computer. Refer to our browser's help section for instructions.

#### Security Information

MyPizza.com always uses industry standard encryption technologies, such as 128 bit SSL encryption, when transferring and receiving private consumer data on our Website. This information can only be translated once it is received by our secure services. These secure servers help to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you through our Website.

#### Policy Changes

From time to time, MyPizza.com may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Website to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should periodically check this section of our Website.
