# Privacy Statement

### ​Queensland Police Service Internet Site: Privacy Statement

The Queensland Police Service (QPS) has established responsible and accountable collection and management arrangements to protect personal information within the Service against loss, misuse or inappropriate modification or disclosure.

QPS information management policies and procedures conform to the requirements of the [Police Service Administration Act 1990](http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/Acts_SLs/Acts_SL_P.htm), [Public Service Act 2008](http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/Acts_SLs/Acts_SL_P.htm), [Public Service Regulations 2008](http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/Acts_SLs/Acts_SL_P.htm) and [Information Privacy Act 2009](http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/ACTS/2009/09AC014.pdf "Information Privacy Act 2009"). Accountability requirements under these legislative provisions and the [Crime and Misconduct Act 2001](http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/Acts_SLs/Acts_SL_C.htm) apply to any alleged contravention of authorised procedures.

Personal information is defined by Information Privacy Act 2009 as, "information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion."

To that end, the department employs the tools provided by Google Analytics to gather information about how the department's website is accessed. Google Analytics uses 'cookies', which are text files placed on your computer, to help the department analyse how users use the site.

The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers located outside of Australia.

### Security of information

The Police Service Administration Act 1990 has specific provisions prohibiting QPS personnel from accessing, recording or disclosing an individual's personal information except in the performance of their duties or in specific situations permitted by law.

While QPS provides a secure environment, you should be aware there are inherent risks associated with the transmission of information via the Internet. For those who do not wish to use the Internet, QPS provides alternate ways (for example, fax, letter and office visits) of obtaining and providing information. In some circumstances, QPS guidelines may require us to send particular information by non-electronic means.

### Collection, use and disclosure of personal information

When the QPS receives your email or online submission form, your details become accessible to staff, and may be recorded.  The collection of this information is authorised by the Police Service Administration Act 1990. The information may be used to assist in performing the statutory functions and responsibilities of the Queensland Police Service (QPS). The QPS may disclose some or all of this information to other State and Federal Government agencies as provided for by legislation or in accordance with the Information Privacy Act 2009.
