We hope this helps you make an informed decision about sharing personal information with us.

We use your information in these five ways only. We will only use your personal information in the way we specified when it was collected. We will not subsequently change the way your personal information is used without your consent.

This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance and effectiveness of our website and e-newsletters.



  
We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties, except as necessary for data processing or order completion. For example, we use various outside shipping companies to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill customers for the products they've purchased. These companies do not share or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes, with only one exception. Our relationship with Omlet, the makers of several products on the My Pet Chicken website, may use the personal information of people who have purchased Omlet products for marketing purposes. You may opt out of these communications with them at any time by visiting their [ website](http://www.omlet.us/) and either emailing or phoning them them with your removal request.

We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process by disclosing your personal information and other related information, if necessary. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 

We may collect and possibly share personal information and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 

According to the laws of the State of Connecticut, we must share the following information with Connecticut's Department of Agriculture when clients residing within Connecticut place orders for baby chicks:   
First name  
Last name  
Mailing Address  
Number of chicks purchased  
Date of order

The Department of Agriculture aims to support backyard chicken-keepers by handing out pamphlets that provide information on free disease testing resources, how to checking for syptoms of illness, and so on. 

We will ask you for your opt-in consent to share your personal information with a third party for any other reason. 

  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

When we transfer sensitive personal data (for example, credit card information) over the Internet, we protect it using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.

Some portions of our website will not allow you to complete certain activities if cookies are disabled. If you do not accept cookies, the associated shopping basket will not work and you will not be able to place an order.
