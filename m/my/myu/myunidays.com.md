MyUnidays Ltd is committed to preserving the privacy of all visitors and users of myunidays.com. Please read the following privacy policy to understand how we use and protect the information that you provide to us.

For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“Act”), the data controller is MyUnidays Ltd of 2 Castle Boulevard, Nottingham, NG7 1FB.

By registering to any service offered by myunidays.com, you consent to the collection, use and transfer of your information under the terms of this policy.

### Information that we collect from you 

When you visit, register or view information about products or services on myunidays.com you may be asked to provide certain information about yourself including your name, educational status, institution name and your current e-mail address. We may also collect information about your usage of our website as well as information about you from messages you post to the website and e-mails or letters you send to us.

When you first subscribe to myunidays.com your e-mail address and myunidays.com password will be retrieved, encrypted and then stored in our secure database. This password will never be disclosed to any person. By agreeing to the myunidays.com Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy you give permission for this data to be stored in a secure environment for this purpose.

### Use of your information

Your information will enable us to provide you with access to specific parts of our site and to operate the myunidays.com service for you. We will also use and analyse the information we collect so that we can administer, support, improve and develop our business.

In particular, we may use your information to contact you for your views on our services and to notify you occasionally about important changes or developments to the site or our services.

Further, we might also use your information to let you know about other products and services which we offer which may be of interest to you. If you change your mind about being contacted in the future, please let us know.

If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.

For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, such as photos and videos (“Media”), subject to your account settings, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license (“Licence”) to use any Media that you provide in connection with your account for any of our commercial or non-commercial purposes including, without limitation, in our printed publications, presentations, promotional materials, advertising or on our website. This License ends when you delete your Media or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.

When you delete Media, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).

### Disclosure of your information 

The information you provide to us will be held on our secure computers in the UK and Ireland may be accessed by or given to our staff working outside the UK, some of whom may be located outside the European Economic Area, who act for us for the purposes set out in this policy or for other purposes approved by you. Those parties process information and provide support services on our behalf. We may also pass aggregate information on the usage of our site to third parties, but this will not include information that can be used to identify you.

Finally, if our business enters into a joint venture with or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed to our new business partners or owners.

Countries outside the European Economic Area do not always have strong data protection laws. However, we will always take steps to ensure that your information is used by third parties in accordance with this policy.

Unless required to do so by law, we will not otherwise share, sell or distribute any of the information you provide to us without your consent.
