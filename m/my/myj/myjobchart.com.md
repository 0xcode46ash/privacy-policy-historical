##### Information We Collect

We collect information about you directly from you, from third parties, and automatically through your use of our Services. We may combine all of the information we collect about you from these various sources.

  * **_Information We Collect Directly from Parents._** We may collect certain information directly from parents. For example, to create an account we will collect a parent’s name, email address, password, and zip code; to facilitate payments for our Services and to a parent’s or a relative’s child through our Services we will collect bank account, or other similar financial information, and address. We will also collect any information that a parent voluntarily provides to us, such as gender, date of birth, cell phone number, responses to surveys or questionnaires, or requests or inquiries submitted through our Services. 
  * **_Information We Collect from Third Parties._** We may also collect information about you from third parties. For example, parents provide us with information about children, including the child’s username, password, age and/or date of birth, and gender. Similarly, if a relative wants to be a financial contributor to a child, the parent will also provide us with that relative’s username, password, and bank account or financial information. 
  * **_Information We Collect Automatically._** We automatically collect information about all users’ use of our Site or App through cookies and other technologies, including without limitation:

If a parent does not want us to collect and use their child’s personal information anymore, then s/he may cancel his/her child’s account and use of the Services.
