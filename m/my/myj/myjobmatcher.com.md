## Information Collection and Use

You can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, in certain sections of this Site, to use certain services, we may require you to create an account, or we may invite you to submit questions or comments or request information, subscribe to a newsletter, participate in surveys, questionnaires or contests, or message boards. Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may ask that you complete and submit an online form with personally identifiable information such as your name, username, email address, zip code and contact information. If you have created an account, you may opt to provide additional personally identifiable information in your profile such as your age, gender and employment information. Providing any additional personally identifiable information beyond what is required to create an account is optional. We may use your personally identifiable information to deliver certain services, products or information you have requested, verify your authority to enter certain password protected areas of the Site, send you notices for services that you have used or that may be of interest to you, and improve the content and general administration of the Site. We also may from time to time automatically opt you in to other products and services that our group parent Opinio Group Limited owns and/or operates. You can at any time opt out of these or unsubscribe as appropriate.

## Cookies

We may use small text files called cookies to improve overall Site experience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you. Some advertisements that appear on this Site are delivered to you by our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may download cookies to your computer. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement. In this way, they may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. This information allows an advertising network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. We do not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers.

## Aggregate Information

The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, IP addresses, External Web Sites (defined below) linked to, search criteria and the domain names of our users' Internet Service Providers, and we may analyse these data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We also may collect aggregate labour statistics from public records. Such aggregate information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We may use such aggregate information to analyse trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may share this aggregate information with third parties, including for various reasons related to our business to assist them in targeting advertisements to appropriate audiences.

## Disclosure

We will also disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority. We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any other company or organization except we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which MyJobMatcher.com participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of MyJobMatcher.com's assets to which this Site relates. Such successor entity shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

The Site may provide links to other Web sites or resources over which MyJobMatcher.com does not have control ("External Web Sites").
