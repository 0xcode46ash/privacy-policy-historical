## A statement about privacy and collection of personal information

UBM Medica Australia Pty Ltd (" **We** ", " **Our** ", or " **Us** ") as publisher of _myDr_ ( **Website** ), aims to protect the privacy of the personal information We collect and hold whilst carrying out Our business activities. 

We are bound by the National Privacy Principles ( **Principles** ) in the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth)( **Act** ). 

This statement explains: 

  * what types of personal information We might collect
  * how We aim to use personal information
  * when We will disclose personal information to others
  * how We manage and secure personal information, and
  * how you can access personal information that We hold about you.



This statement does not form part of any contract. 

From time to time, We may review and update this statement - for example, to reflect changes to the law, technology or Our company. We reserve the right to change this statement at any time and notify you by posting an updated version of the statement on the Website. 

## What types of personal information do we collect?

We aim only to collect 'personal information' (as defined under the Act) that is necessary for Our activities. The types of personal information that We collect will depend on the nature of the interaction between you and Us, and where and how We collect the information. 

Most commonly, the information collected from you may include your name, address/es, email address/es, telephone and fax number/s, and other contact details, your medical practitioner registration details (if relevant), and also information about your use of Our services or the Website. 

Some of the information We collect is 'sensitive information' (as defined under the Act). The Act requires Us only to collect sensitive information from you where this is consented to by you, or if the collection is required by law, and only to share sensitive information if We have a belief that its use and/or disclosure is necessary to prevent threats to health, life or safety of any individual. 

## How do We collect your personal information?

We collect most of your personal information directly from you, for example when you send Us correspondence by e-mail, via the Website or in writing; deal with Us over the telephone or in person; or register or post information on the Website. 

Sometimes, someone else may provide Us with personal information about you, with or without your direct involvement. For example, We might collect your personal information from: 

  * another organisation or alliance you are a member of
  * your representative
  * publicly available sources of information (such as telephone directories), or
  * commercially available mailing or marketing lists.



## How do We use your personal information?

In most cases, if We ask you to provide information about yourself it is because We need that information for the purpose it was collected or to provide you with the information you require or access to the Website. For example, We may use your personal information to: 

  * verify that you are an Australian healthcare practitioner (if relevant)
  * tailor your experience of Our site to your interests
  * provide you with access to certain parts of the Website
  * provide ongoing support or help manage the Website, for example if you have a query about this statement
  * communicate with you, for example to seek feedback regarding your experiences with the Website, or the information, the services and the promotions offered on the Website
  * provide information about other events, promotions, products or services that We believe would interest you (which you can tell Us not to do at any time)
  * help us run Our organisation, for example to improve the Website. Our products or services or Our security, train staff or undertake marketing activities, and 
  * comply with legal obligations.



## When will We disclose your personal information to others?

We aim to confine Our disclosure of personal information to the primary purpose for which it has been collected, or for a related purpose. This means We will usually only disclose personal information in order to fulfil our business and admininstrative functions, including when disclosure is necessary to complete a transaction on your behalf; provide you with a product, service or activity you have requested; help Us with the running of Our organisation; or for security reasons. 

We may also disclose your personal information outside Our organisation for the purpose for which the information was collected, for a related purpose - for example when disclosure is necessary to complete a transaction on your behalf, provide you with a product, service or activity you have requested, help Us with the running of Our organisation, or for security reasons. 

We may provide your personal information to: 

  * companies related to Us that are located in Australia or offshore
  * outsourced service providers who perform functions on Our behalf, such as organisations providing security services, conducting market research, providing advertising/marketing services, or providing hosting, email or mail handling services to Us or Our service providers
  * anyone authorised by you to receive your personal information (your consent may be express or implied and can be withdrawn at any time)
  * an actual or prospective purchaser in the event We sell part of Our business, and
  * anyone We are required by law to disclose it to.



We generally require third parties only to use your personal information for the specific purpose for which it was given and to protect the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information. 

You consent to us disclosing your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time by informing Us that you withdraw that consent. 

To the extent that the Website contains links to sites operated by third parties, including other organisations, those linked websites are not controlled by Us and We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the site operators. Before you disclose your personal information to any linked websites, We advise you to examine their privacy policies and terms and conditions of use.
