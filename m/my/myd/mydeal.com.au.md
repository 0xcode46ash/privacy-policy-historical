**Personal Information**

There are two main ways we collect information about you:

**If you are not or do not login as a MyDeal Member**

Whenever you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information about your usage of the Site, such as the time of your visit, its duration and the pages you visit. This is to help us understand what parts of the Site our users enjoy the most and to help us ensure that advertisements on the Site are most directly relevant to your interests. If you have not identified yourself on the Site, such as by registering for Membership or logging in as a Member, the information we collect about you remains anonymous. 

**If you login as a MyDeal Member**

When you first register for membership, we collect information from you such as your email, name, suburb, and will continue to add to your member profile as you interact more on the Site, for example, if you enter a competition.   
Once you have become a registered member, we collect personal information about you in order to provide you with the full benefits of Membership. It will also enable MYDEAL to bill you and contact you, where necessary, concerning your use of the MYDEAL Site. MYDEAL will also use and analyse the information it collects so that it can administer, support, improve and develop our business.   
In  particular, MYDEAL may contact you for your views on the Site and also to notify you about changes or developments to the Site and services. If you have consented, we may also use your information in order to advise you about other products and services which we offer. 

**How we preserve your privacy**

MYDEAL will maintain any information in strict confidence and only use this information in connection with the operation of the Site and in compliance with the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 (as amended by the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) 2000 (Cth))  or other statutory provision or direction of law or at the direction of a law enforcement agency or other authorised government authority.   
MYDEAL does not collect sensitive information beyond information outlined above about users. 

**Security of Your Information**

MYDEAL takes all reasonable steps to ensure that sensitive information that MYDEAL collects is only accessible by authorised persons. We will retain your information for a reasonable time or as long as the law requires.   
No transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure and although MYDEAL will take reasonable steps to protect information storage, MYDEAL cannot guarantee the integrity of transmission over the internet and has no liability for such. 

**Third Parties**

Your personal sensitive information and data is only shared with third parties at your direction or in connection with your use of the Site or as is required or permitted by law. This may include instances where we are required to transmit personal information according to instructions received from a law enforcement agency or other authorised body.   
Where MYDEAL does make information or data available to certain authorised agents of MYDEAL, it will do so only in connection with the operation of the Site and MYDEAL will ensure that they apply the MYDEAL Pricacy Policy or in applicable statutory or common law requirement. MYDEAL will not pass your information on to advertisers except with your permission.   
Please note that in using the Site you may be communicating with individuals and organisations outside of Australia. In that case, their use of your personal information may not be covered by Australian law or an applicable privacy protection scheme. 

**Secure Online Transactions** If you purchase a Coupon through our website, we process your credit card details securely over the Internet using eWAY’s bank-grade data centre (eWAY is an accredited Internet payment security system authorised as a third party processor for all major Australian banks). With the combination of transaction performed under 256 Bit SSL Certificate on our website and a secure browser at your end, we take all measures to ensure that your credit card and anonymity are protected when you purchase online.

**Redeeming Coupons with Merchants** When you purchase a Coupon, MYDEAL may need to forward your name and contact information to the relevant Merchant in order to redeem the Coupon to receive the Deal or you may be required to provide your personal information to the relevant Merchant at the time you redeem your Coupon. In those instances, your personal information will be governed by the privacy policy of the relevant Merchant.

Also, with your consent, MYDEAL may pass your personal information on to Merchants from whom you have received a Deal, so that the Merchant can keep you informed of future events/offers they may be providing. If you are required to make a booking with a Merchant in order to redeem your Coupon, you may be asked at the time of that booking if you would like to receive this information. You may change your preference at any time directly with the Merchant which has collected your personal information. If you do not have the Merchant’s contact details you may contact our Privacy Officer directly.

**Non-customer information**

Sometimes, MYDEAL needs to collect personal information about individuals who are not Account holders or customers. This will usually arise where we collect the name and business contact details of a person who is the contact in a government agency or company with whom we deal. MYDEAL’s policy is to only use personal information collected from non-customers for the main business purpose for which it was collected.

**Changing Your Information**

If you are a MyDeal Member, you are able to view and amend your Personal Information stored by MYDEAL at all times. MYDEAL will not amend your personal information except at your direction.
