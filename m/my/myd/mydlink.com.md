##### Registration 

In order to use the TelTel, you must first complete the registration form. During registration you are required to provide a valid email address and to choose a password and display name. We use your email address and password to validate your identity each time you login. Your display name identifies you to other TelTel users. Other TelTel users do not see your email address. 

When you register, we send you a single welcome email. Clicking on the link in the welcome email allows us to verify that the email address you provided is active and correct.

##### Add A Friend Feature 

If you choose to invite another person to register with TelTel and join your Friend List, you have the option of sending the invitation by email. The invitee's name (optional) and email address, and your name (optional) are stored temporarily and are used only to generate the email invitation. After the invitation is sent, we delete this information. In particular, we do not store your name and if the invitee chooses not to register with TelTel, we store no information about him or her. If the invitee chooses to register with TelTel using a different email address, we store only the information he or she explicitly provides during registration.

##### Communications Contents 

TelTel.com does NOT monitor or store the contents of any call or conference in which you participate. The contents of any Call Me request that you send or receive are stored on our servers until they expire, until the sender and the receiver complete a call, or until the sender removes them, AT WHICH TIME WE DELETE ALL RECORD OF THE CALL ME REQUEST. A Call Me request comprises a sender, a receiver, an importance (High, Medium, or Low), a short text message (optional), and an expiration time.

##### Call Detail Records 

All telephony applications retain Call Detail Records (CDRs) for administrative and, possibly, billing purposes. A CDR is a record of the caller, the callee, the date and timestamp, the elapsed time, and the call failure class (in the case of an unsuccessful call). As stated in the previous section, a CDR does not include any record of the call contents. CDRs are automatically generated by our system and are stored centrally on TelTel.com servers in the United States and/or China. 

TelTel.com uses the information contained in CDRs in an aggregated statistical form for the purposes of improving service quality and of detecting fraud or misuse. We reserve the right to share aggregate usage data with third parties, but we do NOT sell, rent, loan, trade, lease, or otherwise share personally identifiable information about your usage patterns without your explicit consent.

##### Cookies 

Cookies are small files that are stored on your hard drive. TelTel.com uses encrypted ?î¯Šookies??to enable TelTel users to add friends to their Friend Lists. Specifically, we do NOT use cookies to track user behavior. Because the cookies are encrypted, they represent no threat to the security of your personal information even if someone were to gain access to your computer.

##### Call Forwarding and Find-Me services

If users wish to use the TelTel Call-Forwarding and Find-Me services, users need to provide telephone numbers in order for the service to be provided. Collected information for such purposes is stored in TelTel servers through user submission.

#### Risks and Disclaimers 

##### Information You Share With Other TelTel Users 

When you contact another TelTel user or join a phone conference with other TelTel users, you should be aware that any personal information you share with that user is potentially subject to misuse and abuse. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you choose to share with other TelTel users. 

Also be aware that, as with any peer-to-peer communication application, another user of the TelTel software may be able to obtain your IP address if you join a call or conference with that user.

##### Legal Requests 

In response to a verified request by a law enforcement or government agency relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can disclose your email address and usage patterns without a subpoena if we believe in good faith that the disclosure of this information is necessary to prevent imminent physical or mental harm, or financial loss. We will not disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government agencies for any other reason in the absence of a subpoena or court order.

##### Personal Information Review and Change Request

We do not maintain any procedure for you to review or request changes to the information that we collect about you, except that you may request that we remove all information about you from our database by contacting us in accordance with the Account Deactivation and Deletion section below.

##### Account Deactivation and Deletion 

Upon your request, we will deactivate your account and delete all your personally identifiable information from our databases as soon as reasonably possible provided we are under no obligation to retain this information in response to a criminal investigation as described in the previous section. Send your deactivation requests to [delete@teltel.com ](mailto:delete@teltel.com). We will confirm receipt of your request and before deactivating your account will verify that you sent the request.

##### Security 

TelTel.com stores your information centrally on servers in the United States and China. We use procedural and technical safeguards (including firewalls, encryption, and access control lists) to protect this information against loss, theft, or unauthorized access. Although we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information you submit, both during transmission and once we receive it, no method of transmission over the Internet or of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to safeguard your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

##### Change of Ownership

In order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell our company or our assets, including the information collected through this website. If our Company or substantially all of our assets are acquired, customer information may be one of the assets transferred to the acquirer.
