**Access to Personal Information**  
myhosting.com provides individuals with access to Personal Information held about them and complies with the individual access principal of Schedule 1, Clause 4.9 of PIPEDA.

If an individual believes that their Personal Information on file is not correct, individuals can access the myhosting.com web-based Control Panel that allows individuals to view and update all of their Personal Information at any time.

Pursuant to Schedule 1, Clause 4.9.5 of PIPEDA, an individual may also request that myhosting.com delete an individual’s Personal Information from myhosting.com’s system and records . However, due to technical constraints and the fact that myhosting.com backs up its systems, Personal Information may continue to reside in myhosting.com’s systems after deletion for some time. Individuals, therefore, should not expect that their Personal Information would be completely removed from myhosting.com’s systems in response to an accepted request for deletion.

myhosting.com reserves the right to decline access to Personal Information where disclosure of the information requested is not required, as per Division 1, Clause 9 of PIPEDA.

Where information will not or cannot be disclosed, the individual making the request will be provided with the reasons for non-disclosure, pursuant to the principal in Schedule 1, Clause 4.9.4 of PIPEDA. Where information will be disclosed, myhosting.com will endeavour to provide the information in question within a reasonable time and no later than thirty (30) days following the request. 

myhosting.com will not respond to repetitious or vexatious requests for access. In determining whether a request is repetitious or vexatious, myhosting.com will consider such factors as the frequency with which information is updated, the purpose for which the information is used, and the nature of the information.

To guard against fraudulent requests for access, myhosting.com will require sufficient information to allow it to confirm the identity of the person making the request before granting access or making corrections.

**Amendment of myhosting.com practices and this Policy**  
This statement is in effect as of January 1, 2004. myhosting.com will from time to time review and revise its privacy practices and this Policy.
