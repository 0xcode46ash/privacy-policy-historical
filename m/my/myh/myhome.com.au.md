# myhome.com.au privacy policy - myhome.com.au Australian real estate search

"myhome.com.au" is owned and operated by The Real Estate Institute of Victoria Ltd ("REIV"). REIV is a related body corporate to realestateVIEW.com.au Ltd.

myhome.com.au respects the privacy of the users of its site and the other people we do business with. We strive to comply with the National Privacy Principles ("NPPs") contained in the Privacy Act 1988 and Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000 (Cth) (collectively referred to as the "Privacy Act") when we handle personal information (that is, information from which a person's identity reasonably can be ascertained).

This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information we may collect (both online and offline) and how myhome.com.au will handle personal information about you.

* ### What kind of personal information does myhome.com.au collect and how

Myhome.com.au collects personal information from members of the public and other people it does business with (eg contact people in external service providers). If you use the myhome.com.au website you may be asked to provide personal information such as your name, addresss, contact details and gender. Personal information is any information (whether fact, opinion or evaluative material) about you as an individual, from which your identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained.

Otherwise, the personal information collected is generally limited to business contact information.

* ### How and why myhome.com.au collects personal information

Website users: if you use the myhome.com.au website, personal information will be collected directly from the website so that we can deliver and improve the website and so that we can provide you with the services you have requested (eg so you can subscribe to our services or request some other service from myhome.com.au).

We may also ask you to provide personal information if you complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a competition or an event, seek employment, post a message to our message board or communicate with myhome.com.au by email, telephone, mail or in writing or if you use our services.

If you send us an e-mail containing personal information we take steps to ensure the confidentiality of that information. The content of e-mails is sometimes monitored for maintenance and fault detection purposes or for legal compliance purposes.

We may use your e-mail address for the purpose for which you provided it. We may also use your e-mail address to respond to feedback given about this site, and to confirm receipt of e-mails if we need to contact you for any reason. We may send you an e-mail providing general information about services that we provide or that are available to you from other persons, to provide any information you request. Each time we do that, we will give you the opportunity to choose not to receive more e-mails of that type.

Business contacts: Sometimes myhome.com.au needs to collect personal information from people we do business with. This will usually happen when we collect the name and business details of a real estate agent or its employees. We collect this information in order to carry out our business.

myhome.com.au's policy is only to use personal information for the purpose for which it was collected (or related purposes that can be reasonably expected).

The information provided on the myhome.com.au website will be used by myhome.com.au and realestateVIEW.com.au to send you relevant information. We won't use your personal information for any other purpose without your consent.

From time to time we may use your personal information to inform you about our services and products or promotions that we think may be of interest to you. We will give you the opportunity to express a wish not to receive these direct marketing communications. You can let us know at any time if you do not wish to receive direct marketing communications by contacting us by the means below and we will remove your details from our direct marketing database.

If the law requires us to provide you with information about our products or services, we will provide that information even if you have elected not to receive information about those products or services generally.

* ### Does myhome.com.au collect Sensitive Information?

"Sensitive Information" includes personal information relating to a person's health, race and ethnic origin (among other things). As a general rule, we don't need to collect Sensitive Information. If we do need it for a specific purpose (eg to provide you with a service you have requested), we will seek your consent before we collect it.

* ### Will your personal information be given to anyone else?

It is generally our policy not to disclose information to external organisations, however, we may sometimes need to disclose your personal information to others for the purposes set out above.

If you volunteer personal information to a real estate agent through our website, it will be disclosed to that real estate agent (which will handle that personal information in accordance with its own privacy policy).

Personal information collected by myhome.com.au is automatically shared with realestateVIEW.com.au Ltd. This information may also be shared with third parties in the following circumstances:

  * with your consent, we will provide your personal information to organisations who are sponsoring or otherwise involved with or participating in a competition, survey, promotion; and
  * we may provide your personal information to other companies or individuals to whom we outsource specialised functions (including but not limited to mailing houses, printing companies, data processors, data analysts and research companies). If we do outsource functions in this way, we take steps to ensure that those contractors: 
    * comply with the NPPs when they handle personal information about you (regardless of whether they are a small business, and would otherwise be exempt from the NPPs); and
    * are bound to use the personal information for the same purpose as the information was collected (ie in order to provide the services or to perform the functions required by myhome.com.au).



In addition, the myhome.com.au website allows you to send emails to a third party, such as our "email a friend" service. If you provide us with personal information as part of those emails, it will be disclosed to the recipient of that email. If a third party provides us with your personal information by using such services, we will deal with that personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy as if you had disclosed that personal information directly to us.

Sometimes the law requires us to disclose personal information. For example, information may be disclosed to a court in response to a subpoena or to a Government agency. We may also disclose personal information where you consent to us doing so. That consent may be written, verbal or implied from your conduct.

Otherwise, myhome.com.au will only disclose personal information if required or authorised by law.
