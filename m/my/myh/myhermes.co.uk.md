## Parcel Recipient Satisfaction Surveys

We may from time to time contact your parcel recipient to ask  if they would like to take part in a satisfaction survey to rate our delivery service. We collect such data in order to check that we have carried out our contract in accordance with the terms agreed with you and to ensure that we are providing a great service. 

We would only contact your parcel recipient:

  1. by email;
  2. using the email address details that you may provide to us when you submit your order; and
  3. If you have opted for your parcel recipient to receive an email with tracking details relating to their parcel delivery. Your recipient will then be aware that Hermes has delivered their parcel. Please note that your parcel recipient may also receive an email from Hermes asking for their feedback in relation to the parcel delivery service provided. 



If your parcel recipient chooses to take part in the survey, the website hosting the survey will display terms explaining how we will use the data collected to improve our services.
