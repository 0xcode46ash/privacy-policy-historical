# Privacy Policy - MyTona

**Privacy Policy ​**1\. IntroductionAt MyTona, we make every effort to protect the privacy of those who use our games, website(s) and all other related services that may be provided at any given time (hereinafter, “Services”). Outlined here is our policy (hereinafter, “Privacy Policy”) for collecting, processing and storing information that belongs to you. This includes personal details such as name, address, telephone number and email address. Throughout the remainder of this document, said information shall be referred to as “Personal Data”.

In order to protect your Personal Data, we follow generally accepted industry standards for privacy during transmission of information and at the time we receive it. Nevertheless, please keep in mind that no information that is electronically stored or transmitted using the Internet is 100% secure. For this reason, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data even though it is our goal to do so, so please remember this when you choose to provide personal information. Any information that you decide to make public in your user profile, or that you may post in comments, will be visible to others. We shall not be liable for any Personal Data that you choose to make public in this or any other manner.

It is not our policy to allow anyone under the age of 13 to provide Personal Data. It must be understood that if you are not considered to be of legal age in your country of residence, you are required to obtain the consent of your parent or legal guardian for us to collect or use Personal Data in compliance with this Privacy Policy. If you are not able to obtain this consent or are under the age of 13, do not submit any Personal Data to our Services.  
All information that is entered via our Services or provided in any other manner, including third-party sites and services as well as cookies from third parties, which authorize us to access your information (such as Google or Facebook) will be stored. Information of this nature could include your name, email address, IP address, usernames and passwords, and browser information, along with any other necessary information that may help us provide you with our Services. You may choose not to provide certain Personal Data, but in doing so you may not experience our Services’ special features to the fullest extent.  
By using and/or accessing our Services, you authorize us to collect, store, process and share your Personal Data in the manners set forth herein. If you are at all concerned about the way that your Personal Data is used as authorized in this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using our Services.

2\. Personal Data collected from you and how it is collected

Certain types of Personal Data is collected and stored when you use our Services. MyTona may receive and record such information automatically, to include your Vendor/Advertising Identifiers, Android ID, IP address, MAC address, browser and cookie information, timestamps, operating system information, pages that you frequent, applications you download and the path or actions you take when using our Services.

Cookies  
We use cookies, which are small files that store information on your computer or mobile device to help us optimize the use of our Services. 

 Reasons for using cookies include:  
\- to recognize you or your device, such as through your IP address;  
\- to allow interaction between our Services and a third-party social network/platform (if you have authorized such an interaction);  
\- to process payments;  
\- to provide customized Services, such as using the language you have selected;  
\- to collect statistical data that will allow for analysis of how our Services are used to be able to improve them. 

You authorize our use of cookies in compliance with this Privacy Policy when you access our website(s) or use our Services. You may disable cookies at any time using the browser settings on your device, but in doing so you may not experience our Services’ features to the fullest extent. 

Because we advertise our Services on mobile devices, Advertising Identifiers, which are temporary device identifiers that allow us to provide advertising related to your own personal interests, are used. Examples of these are Android advertising IDs or Apple advertising IDs. These identifiers and other related information are held either by us or are provided to us by network partners who provide advertising for us, and can help us analyze how effective ad campaigns are. You may disable this feature in your device settings menu to either prevent your advertising ID from being used or to change it. 

Payment Information   
We collect payment information for our payment service providers when you purchase Services on our website(s), but please know that this payment information is only stored temporarily and is cached so as to prevent MyTona from being able to read it. For in-app purchases (such as through the App Store, Windows Store, Google Play or Amazon Kindle) we do not store payment information. 

3\. How is your Personal Data used?

First and foremost, when you use our Services or website(s) you are authorizing us to use your Personal Data to:

\- contact you, whether for customer service purposes or to send information regarding our Services;  
\- manage your account and improve your experience when using our Services;  
\- research, survey and interact with you, for example via email or other communications;   
\- market or promote our Services and/or related products, by sending communications, including on behalf of a third party, such as information about merchandise related to our services. If you would like to decline the use of your Personal Data in this manner, please contact [snsupport@mytona.com](mailto:snsupport@mytona.com);  
- create reports, analyses or similar for our own research or market purposes, for example to track trends or problems using our Services;  
- prevent crime, fraud or cheating. If necessary, you authorize us to share your Personal Data with fraud prevention agencies or related organizations;  
\- do anything else related or authorized in this Privacy Policy or according to applicable law.

4\. Your Personal Data will be shared with third parties

We do share your information with third parties, such as affiliates or suppliers, but only:

\- with your consent (as authorized in this Privacy Policy);   
 \- certain information for our advertising partners with whom we have relevant signed agreements. This information will enable third-party advertising companies to offer you advertisements and for other marketing purposes;  
\- as explicitly necessary to be able to provide Services to you (such as to suppliers of ours that are needed for you to use our Services or that need to communicate with you regarding our Services);  
\- when it is necessary to do as you have requested (such as when making a payment);  
\- when we can provide third parties with anonymous and statistical data;  
\- when you voluntarily provide Personal Data via an interaction with our social media channels (such as a testimonial) or enter a competition. In this case you authorize us to publish your Personal Data on our website and social media channels;   
\- as necessary in accordance with applicable law and regulations;   
\- to comply with legal obligations, to apply or enforce our terms and conditions or any other agreement we have entered into with you, or to protect the rights, property and security of MyTona and others;  
\- when there is a corporate restructuring or sale of assets involving MyTona, or as a result of a change in control of MyTona or affiliate, or to prepare for any of these events. Any third party who is the recipient of such a transfer or sale is authorized to continue using your Personal Data as provided to us, according to this Privacy Policy. 

We do not sell or rent your Personal Data to any third party unless it is related to one of the above reasons.

5\. Playing our games with other players 

In the event you use a third-party social network or platform to access our Services, this third party may provide your Personal Data to us if you so allow. These websites or applications are created by a third party that is not affiliated with or controlled by MyTona. Please be sure to carefully read their terms of service and privacy policy so that you understand how they use your Personal Data and what might be shared. 

When you allow any interaction between our Services and any social network or platform that belongs to a third party, we also may share Personal Data with your contacts for you to enjoy playing with others (hereinafter, “Social Data”). Social Data includes your name, your profile picture and your scores/progress in our games.   
You may, at any time, make changes to the data that these third-party social networks or platforms share with us by changing your settings for that provider, or stop allowing our Services to interact with that provider. In doing so you may not experience our Services’ special features to the fullest extent.

6\. Storage of Information

Your Personal Data will be stored as long as is necessary to provide you with Services or to complete whatever purpose it was originally provided for. Even after you have closed your account or have stopped using our Services, we may continue to store your Personal Data if doing so is necessary for us to fulfill our legal obligations, meet requirements of applicable regulations, resolve member disputes, prevent fraud, abuse or cheating, or any other reason that falls under this Privacy Policy or other user agreement.

7\. Protection of Information 

We take the security of your Personal Data very seriously. We implement the appropriate technical and physical safeguards to ensure that your Personal Data is protected against accidental or unlawful loss, destruction, alteration, unauthorized access or disclosure, or any other use or unlawful processing of Personal Data you have provided to us. Our security mechanisms for Personal Data are similar to those of other game developers. Please keep in mind, though, that the Internet is not 100% secure and any access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the Personal Data you have provided through our games due to breach of our safeguards cannot be guaranteed.

8\. Links to third parties in our Services

In our Services and on our website(s), we may embed links to third-party websites. It must be understood that when you click on any of these links, you will be taken to a third-party site and therefore any Personal Data you provide will not be protected under this Privacy Policy, but rather that of the third party. Of course we take great care in selecting reputable links, but understand that MyTona is not responsible for the security of your Personal Data on any third-party site.

9\. Your Personal Data rights

\- You may, at any time, request a copy of all Personal Data that you have provided and we store. If you choose to do so, you may contact snsupport@mytona.com.  
 \- In order to serve you better and maximize your experience using our Services, we appreciate you taking the time to provide accurate and updated Personal Data. At any time, you may contact the email addresses above to change, correct or remove any Personal Data you have previously provided.  
\- Any Personal Data that you have shared while using our Services on any third-party social network or platform is no longer solely our responsibility, and therefore cannot be changed, modified or deleted by us. We also will not have control over any Personal Data that has been copied on a third-party network or platform (such as when you allow a “friend” on that network interacts with your account).  
\- You have the right to request that we not use your Personal Data for marketing purposes. To change these preferences or to unsubscribe from such analysis, contact snsupport@mytona.com.

In the event our Privacy Policy is changed or updated, any changes or updates will be posted to keep you aware of the Personal Data that we collect, how it is used and stored, and when we are authorized to disclose it.
