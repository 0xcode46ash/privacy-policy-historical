# TimeStation - Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

Last Updated: **10/07/2011**

Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At TimeStation, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.

**Information TimeStation gathers and tracks**

TimeStation gathers two types of information about users:

\- Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to use the service or request information.

\- Information TimeStation gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our site. 

Under no circumstances does TimeStation divulge any information about an individual user to a third party. 

**Children**

Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.

**Usage tracking**

TimeStation tracks user traffic patterns throughout our site. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. TimeStation does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).

**Cookies**

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. 

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to logon to your account.

**Use of Information**

TimeStation uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our site, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the site or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.

When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our site users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. 

**Sharing of the Information**

TimeStation uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs. We will not share information about individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

**Security**

TimeStation operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall, encryption and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.

By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by TimeStation. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
