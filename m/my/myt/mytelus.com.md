# About TELUS - Privacy

Although our ability to provide service requires that we collect personal information about our customers, we take measures to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of that information.

Our commitment to safeguarding your privacy is reflected in our [TELUS Privacy Code](http://about.telus.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadBody/2461-102-1-2451/Privacy%20Code_EN%20updated%20Jun%202011.pdf), which governs the behavior of our employees with regard to the collection, use and disclosure of our customers' personal information. Our privacy code reflects the federal privacy legislation (the [Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act](http://www.priv.gc.ca/leg_c/leg_c_p_e.cfm)) that came into effect on January 1, 2001.

We have also developed a TELUS Privacy Commitment to explain why we collect personal information and how we use and protect this information. Please refer to our [Privacy Commitment](http://about.telus.com/community/english/privacy/privacy_commitment) for more detailed information about the purposes for which we collect, use and disclose personal information.Â  A copy of our Commitment is provided to all of our customers.

For more information about your privacy, call us at 1-800-567-0000 or write us at [privacy@telus.com](mailto:privacy@telus.com).
