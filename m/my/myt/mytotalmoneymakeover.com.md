# Privacy Policy

**Our Policy Behind Our Privacy Policy**

We refuse to make you read through pages and pages of boring text about a policy that does nothing but trick you into not reading it. Because we have every intention of protecting your privacy, we have made our privacy policy clear and concise enough that you will read it and feel comfortable using our site. We're here to help you, not put you to sleep!

**Our Privacy Policy**

Respecting the privacy and the security of your personal information is important to us. We realize that providing us with personal information is an act of trust. Therefore, we have created a Privacy Policy to show you the steps we have taken to secure that trust. Please take a few moments to read this privacy policy carefully.

**Collected Information**

In certain instances, you may be asked to provide personal information on our site or mobile applications. This information is for administrative or transaction use only. We use it to fulfill orders you have placed, better understand and serve your needs, and provide services tailored to you.

Non-personally identifiable information may be collected by our web-based tools for the purpose of online advertising and is completely anonymous. This information may include such information as your IP address, date and time of visit, domain type, and their activity on our website. None of this information, individually or grouped together, can be traced back to you as an individual.

In web language, a cookie is used to store data on a computer's hard drive. Almost all websites utilize cookies to one extent or another. Some of our web-based tools utilize cookies. These cookies only collect and utilize non-personally identifiable information.

Information you provide within a mobile application will adhere to the same policies stated within this privacy policy unless otherwise noted.  In certain instances, you may be asked or required to share additional information within mobile applications that are provided to third parties. In which case, you will be provided with their privacy policy and terms of service before any information is shared.

**Use of Information**

We do not use your information for any purpose without your consent. Your information will not be accessible to anyone other than our staff or business affiliates whose services you have requested. This information is specifically used by our affiliates to provide you with services you have requested and is not redistributed in any way. All that to say, we won’t sell your information to all the spammers that clutter your inbox!

We make every effort to keep you informed of our own special events, news and offers. Periodically, we send announcements via email or direct mail. If you do not wish to be contacted by our office, simply click on the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email newsletter.

_Note: Your information will be subjected to submission if ordered by a court of law._

**Security**

We are determined to keep your information private. We have even added measures to protect your personal information during transactions. For example, when you supply us with your debit card or checking account information to make a purchase, we encrypt your information to ensure a safe and secure transaction. Your payment information is temporarily stored on a secure server before processing.

All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. We use vendors that specialize in providing secure online payment solutions. None of your payment information can be accessed via the internet. Hey, we buy things online, too, so we understand how important this issue is to you!
