# Myron Privacy Statement

---  
  
Myron Corp. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site: Myron.com.

There are two kinds of unencrypted information that we are interested in when you visit our site: Preferences based on your browsing activities, and Demographics that you provide. Preferences are items of information that tell us about your browsing habits on our web site; that is, how you get to us, which pages you visit, how often you visit them, and what features you use. We use this information to ensure that the current design of our web site continues to meet your evolving needs. We achieve this through the use of "cookies" which are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your hard drive. They are anonymous, in that they do not contain any Personal Information or Demographics.

Demographics are items of information that you tell us about yourself or your company, such as name, street and e-mail addresses, phone number, etc., during the registration process. We use this information ourselves to improve our site and make it as meaningful and personalized as possible for you. We may also use this information to tailor special offers and discounts for you on other products we think may be of interest to you. Myron does not sell, trade or rent demographics to other firms.

Cookies are only used for our own informational purposes. You must enable your browser to accept cookies to have the most robust and meaningful experience possible on our web site.
