Computer and Session Information

The Myartspace Standard Subscription service utilizes cookies, an industry standard used by most major web sites, to simplify the connection and data transfer between the client (user) and the server (our web site) by simulating a continuous connection. A cookie is a small piece of data sent from the server to the client (and in some circumstances from the client to the server), enabling users to access the web site without having to reintroduce themselves with every mouse click. Web sites can thus "remember" information about users to facilitate their preferences for a particular site and allow the use of user passwords. Web browsers are usually set up to accept cookies. You can set yours up to refuse cookies if you prefer, though you may not be able to take full advantage of a web site if you do.

Anonymous Information

Additionally, CatMacArt Corporation gathers anonymous information through traffic data, cookies, and IP addresses or other numeric codes. This information is for system administration and helps us aggregate and keep track of statistics which is useful in our continual effort to improve our service.

Security

Your information is stored in secure databases and is password protected so that only you have access to your Account information. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. CatMacArt Corporation will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email.

CatMacArt Corporation s a global company and the Myartspace Standard Subscription Service has users all over the world. Information you submit while using our service may be sent electronically and used, stored, and processed outside of the country you accessed our web site from. While CatMacArt Corporation strives to ensure that your information is treated securely, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. CatMacArt Corporation cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
