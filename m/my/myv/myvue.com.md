Privacy Policy 

1\. Who we are

Vue Services Limited (Company Number: 03812286) is part of a group of businesses that together form the UK’s leading developer and operator of state-of-the-art cinemas. When we refer to “Vue” or “we” or “our” or “us”, we are referring to Vue Services Limited and its subsidiaries and holding companies and the subsidiaries of such holding companies (as such terms are defined in  the Companies Act 2006), or any of them, as the context requires. 

2\. Why we have a privacy policy 

We have developed this policy because we want you to feel confident about the privacy and security of your personal information when visiting and using our website. When we refer to “personal information” in this privacy policy, we mean information that identifies you as an individual, or is capable of doing so (including but not limited to a first and last name, a home address, an email address or other contact information). 

If you have any queries or requests at any time concerning your personal information held by us or our practices in this regard, please write to our Data Protection Compliance Officer at 10 Chiswick Park, 566 Chiswick High Road, London W4 5XS or email: [dataprotection@myvue.com](mailto:dataprotection@myvue.com). 

3\. What personal information we collect from you 

We collect personal information from you when you register yourself on our website, book cinema tickets or make other purchases via our website, enter into any of our competitions or promotions, submit a customer review or correspond with us at any time. When you visit our website, we also collect information automatically about your visits, such as browsing patterns, but information collected in this way is only used in aggregate and anonymous form rather than being linked to identifiable individuals. 

4\. How we use it 

We use personal information collected from you for the following purposes:   
· To respond to an enquiry made by you.   
· To improve your online experience and to personalise your visits.   
· To improve our products and services and those of our suppliers.   
· To notify you of special offers and promotions and to run them.   
· To process your online cinema ticket bookings and any other transactions you make via our website.   
· To send you film review, screening, scheduling and other information that we think you may be interested in. 

If at any time you would like us to stop using your personal information, please write to our Data Protection Compliance Officer at 10 Chiswick Park, 566 Chiswick High Road, London W4 5XS, or email: [dataprotection@myvue.com](mailto:dataprotection@myvue.com). 

5\. Cookies 

When you visit our website, we may send you cookies. A cookie is a small text file that can be placed on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Three types of cookies are used on our website: 

· Session cookies - these are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave our website. These allow you to carry information across pages of our website and avoid you having to re-enter information. 

· Persistent cookies - these cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). These help us to recognise you as a unique visitor (just a number) when you return to our website and allow us to tailor content, advertisements and the presentation of our website to match your preferences. 

· Third party cookies - third parties serve persistent cookies via our website site. These are used to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics in order to serve advertisements on our website and track whether these advertisements are clicked on by users, to control how often you are shown a particular advertisement, to count the number of anonymous users of the website and to provide security within transactions. 

Our cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features of our website if cookies are disabled. You may disable cookies through your browser by following the instructions found at: [www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies). 

6\. Links 

Our website contains links to other websites. Please note that we do not accept responsibility for the privacy practices of such other websites and we recommend you read the privacy statements on entering other websites. This privacy policy applies only to information collected by our website. 

7\. International data transfers 

The use of a website to collect and process personal information inevitably involves the transmission of data internationally. Please note that the information you enter may be transferred outside the European Economic Area for the purposes of processing. Any transfer of personal information outside of the European Economic Area shall be done in circumstances ensuring that the information is processed only in accordance with this privacy policy. By disclosing your personal information to us you consent to this transfer. 

8\. Business transfers 

We do not collect information with a view to selling it to unconnected third parties. However, in the unlikely event that any of the assets of Vue were sold to a third party, details of our customers would be passed on to that third party as a part of the sale of the business. 

9\. Changes to our policy 

We reserve the right to make changes to our privacy policy at any time without notice. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

10\. Access rights 

Under the Data Protection Act 1998, you may ask us to provide you with the details of any personal information that we hold about you. Such requests should be emailed to dataprotection@myvue.com or posted to our Data Protection Compliance Officer at 10 Chiswick Park, 566 Chiswick High Road, London W4 5XS. 

Please note that an official fee will be payable. If you believe that any information we hold about you is incorrect or incomplete, you should write without delay to our Data Protection Compliance Officer. Any information that is found to be incorrect will be promptly corrected. 

11\. A special note for parents concerning privacy 

Vue makes a special effort to encourage children to consult with their parents before disclosing personal information via our website. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of parents to supervise their children’s online activities and should consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address and other personal information online without parental permission. Vue shall use its reasonable endeavours, whenever possible, to ensure that personal information about or obtained from a child will not be used for commercial or trade purposes without the prior written consent of their parent or legal guardian.
