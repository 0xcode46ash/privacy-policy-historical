## **MYOB values your Privacy**

**Information Collection and Use**

MYOB Australia Pty Ltd is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 

**Registration**

In order to use certain sections of this website, a user must first complete a registration form.  During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. 

**Orders**

We request information from the user on our order form.  Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date).  This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

**Log Files**

We use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad information for aggregate use.  IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**

We may share aggregated information with our business partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

**Links**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that MYOB Australia Pty Ltd is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Security**

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry, Secure Sockets Layer® (SSL). While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator® and Microsoft Internet Explorer® becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, visit [www.ssl.com](http://www.ssl.com/).

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our accounts clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. 

If you have any questions about the security or privacy of information provided via our website please send an email to _[webmaster@myob.com.au](mailto:webmaster@myob.com.au)_[.](mailto:webmaster@myob.com.au)
