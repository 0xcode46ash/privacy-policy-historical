# MyOpinions - Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to the www.myopinions.com.au website.

**How does MyOpinions use the information I provide?**

MyOpinions uses the information you provide in your account settings and account profile to target and personalise the surveys we send to you. We do this to ensure that you only receive relevant and appropriate surveys.

**MyOpinions will not sell or give away your personal information** to any other person, company or organisation, unless it is required by law, or you expressly agree to us giving out your information. 

**What happens to the answers I give in an online survey?**

MyOpinions follows strict market research guidelines that govern what happens to the answers that you give when participating in an online survey. The results of online surveys (where you are invited to participate in the survey by email) are only used for market research analysis. The information you give in these online surveys is not used to target direct marketing messages. You can be assured that any information you provide in an online survey is kept absolutely confidential. 

******What about security?**

MyOpinions has modern and robust security measures in place to protect the information you give to us from loss, misuse and alteration. We are constantly reviewing and upgrading these security measures to ensure the very best of protection for you. 

**What are cookies and why does MyOpinions use them?**

A cookie is a piece of data that becomes stored on your computerâ€™s hard drive, containing information about your account. A cookie can only be accessed across the Internet by the website that placed it there. Cookies are used by the MyOpinions website to add functionality and security. 

You may choose to reject a cookie that the MyOpinions website attempts to place on your computer, however you may then be limited in your use of some areas of the website. The use of cookies in this way is wide-spread and commonly accepted by the Internet community. 

******What about privacy on other websites?**

The MyOpinions website contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our website and to read the privacy statements of other websites that you use. This privacy statement applies only to this website. 

******What is "spam" and does MyOpinions send it?**

The widely accepted definition of "spam" is unsolicited commercial email, or in other words, email of a commercial nature that the recipient does not want. **MyOpinions does not send "spam".** This is because when you subscribe to a MyOpinions newsletter, you must expressly agree to allow us to send to you email.  


******How can I stop MyOpinions from sending me emails?**

Each email we send to you contains a link at the very bottom allowing you to unsubscribe. 

If you have received unwanted email sent from MyOpinions, or purporting to be sent from MyOpinions, please contact us.
