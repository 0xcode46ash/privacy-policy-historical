# MyOpinions

MyOpinions (" **MO** ") is a fun Australian online community to provide sampling solutions and technology for survey research, providing clients with access to consumer respondents via internet. ,. MO serves a vast array of for-profit and not-for profit businesses, universities and governmental agencies and departments. This Privacy Policy sets forth the collection, use and disclosure of personal data or personally identifiable information (" **PII** ") and other information by MO in connection with MO's Services (as defined herein). MO's Services provide you with the opportunity to join a Panel (as defined herein), participate in surveys (whether as a Panel member or a non-Panel member), use the websites associated with the Panels, and receive and redeem rewards and incentives, including, without limitation, sweepstakes entries, offered in connection with Panel membership and/or the completion of surveys (collectively " **Services** "). Registration with, use of, and access to MO's Services is subject to MO's [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms.aspx). Your use of MO's Services is completely voluntary and therefore MO's processing of your PII in connection with the Services and this Privacy Policy is with your consent. MO strives to conform its privacy practices to applicable laws, codes, and regulations, and the codes of standards of applicable market and opinion survey research associations, including, without limitation, ASMOR,. For clarification, except for Panels that have a separate privacy policy, this Privacy Policy applies to all of MO's survey research panels, including, without limitation, MyOpinions (each a " **Panel** " and collectively the " **Panels** "). All references in this Privacy Policy to MO include MO and its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies. All references to "us" or "we" refer to MO. 

All PII is currently stored on servers located in Australia. However, we may without further notice to you, elect to store such PII on servers located in the United States, (" **US** ") - In the event we elect to do so, we agree that we will comply with the European Union (" **EU** ") and US - Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from EU member countries and Switzerland. 

For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, the term " **PII** " shall include, without limitation, your name, address(es), telephone number(s) (including home, cell, and/or business telephone numbers), email address(es), date of birth, the unique identification number we assign to you (individually a " **UID** " and collectively " **UIDs** "), reward, loyalty, or incentive account numbers, and Sensitive Data (as defined herein).

  


## What information is collected by MO, how is PII collected, and how is it used?

**1.Information You Submit.**

MO collects information from Panel members during and after registration with a Panel, including, without limitation, during participation in a survey and in connection with the receipt and redemption of rewards and incentives.

In addition to the collection of PII mentioned above, during and subsequent to the registration process, you may be asked to voluntarily provide or disclose Sensitive Data. "Sensitive Data" means PII that discloses or reveals health and medical conditions, sexual orientation or sexual life, political opinions/views, race/ethnic origin, religious and philosophical beliefs and trade-union membership. Sensitive Data is used to target survey opportunities to you. By way of clarification, by voluntarily disclosing Sensitive Data to MO you expressly consent to the transfer of Sensitive Data by MO to the United States for storage and processing. 

MO collects PII and demographic information from non-Panel members prior to and during participation in a survey. 

You may submit, upload or transmit content or material, including, without limitation, photos, videos and/or any other similar or related content or material ("User Content"). If you submit User Content in connection with MO's Services, the User Content may become publicly available and may be shared with third parties including, without limitation, MO's clients, clients of MO's clients and third party service providers. User Content should only include audio, video, images, or the likeness of the individual submitting the User Content and should not contain copyrighted or trademarked content or material of any third party. User Content should not include audio, video, images, or the likeness of anyone other than the user and should not contain any PII of or about anyone other than the user.

_MO's Online Ad Effectiveness Program._

In connection with MO's online ad effectiveness program, you can participate in surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that MO is testing for its clients. To facilitate the completion of these surveys, MO's clients may write, set, or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies and/or any other related technology (each a " **Third Party Technology** " and collectively the " **Third Party Technologies** "). The Third Party Technologies may be written, set or read in various locations, including, without limitation, MO's servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in or associated with the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and MO's client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, MO's client will send your UID and the specific survey to MO and MO will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey. Additionally, if you participate, MO may share your UID and data previously collected by MO, including, without limitation, age, gender, income, number of people in your household, education/education level, and employment status, (" **Audience Measurement Data** "), to third parties, including, without limitation, MO's subcontractors, partners, and/or clients for the purpose of audience measurement reporting on the advertisements, campaigns, and websites that you visit, view, and/or click on. The Audience Measurement Data will be used to assist in the creation, development, and implementation of websites, online advertisements, and other Internet and digital media features, functionality, and campaigns. Audience Measurement Data may be shared in a single summary form (i.e. individual respondent level) or aggregate summary form (i.e. group of respondents).
