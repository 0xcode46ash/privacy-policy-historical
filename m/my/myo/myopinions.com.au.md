# MyOpinions

## What information does MyOpinions collect about me?

When you join MyOpinions, you must provide us with information about yourself. This is because we need that information so that we can provide you the MyOpinions service.

The information you enter on the main registration form and in the [Account Settings](https://web.archive.org/account/settings.aspx) section is considered personal information, because it can be used to identify you personally. This includes your name, email address, street and postal address, and telephone number.

The information you enter in the [Account Profile](https://web.archive.org/account/profile.aspx) section of the web site is information about you that cannot be used to identify you personally, therefore we consider this non-personal information. This includes, for example, your age, gender, postcode, education, background, and habits.

The information you provide is stored by us for as long as you remain a member.

If you wish to access the information that we hold about you, you may view and update your details through the [Account section](https://web.archive.org/account/) of this website.

## How does MyOpinions use the information I provide?

**_Personal Information_**  
MyOpinions uses the personal information you provide in in the [Account Settings](https://web.archive.org/account/settings.aspx) section to identify you, to validate your identity, to contact you, to send prizes and rewards to you, and to maintain and administer your MyOpinions account.

**MyOpinions will never sell your personal information** to any other person, company or organisation.

In certain circumstances, MyOpinions may need to provide your personal information to a supplier or client as part of the service we provide, however this information will only be shared if you expressly agree to us giving out your information.

It may also be necessary for us to divulge your personal information if it is required by law.

In all other circumstances, MyOpinions will not share or divulge your personal information with any other person, company or organisation.

**_Non-Personal Information_**  
The information you provide in the [Account Profile](https://web.archive.org/account/profile.aspx) section is used to target and personalise the surveys we send to you. We do this to ensure that you only receive relevant and appropriate surveys.

This type of non-personal information is only shared with MyOpinions clients on an aggregate or collective basis. For example, we might tell our clients that 3680 of our members live in a particular town or suburb, or that 43% of our members have indicated an interest in sport. However, we will never tell our clients your name, your email address, your postal or street address or other such personal information.

## What happens to the answers I give in an online survey?

MyOpinions and its clients follow strict market research guidelines that govern what happens to the answers that you give when participating in an online survey. The results of online surveys are only used for market research analysis. The information you give in these online surveys is not used to target direct marketing messages. You can be assured that any information you provide in an online survey is kept absolutely confidential.

## What security measures are in place?

MyOpinions has modern and robust security measures in place to protect the information you give to us from loss, misuse and alteration. We are constantly reviewing and upgrading these security measures to ensure the very best of protection to you.

## Why does MyOpinions record IP Addresses?

When you join MyOpinions, our computers may record your IP address. This is normally used for general administration of our web sites and administration of market research surveys.

In the event that we detect fraud or abuse of our program or our web site and computers, we may use the IP address of the offender to take action against them. Ultimately this ensures greater protection for you and your personal information.

## What are cookies and why does MyOpinions use them?

A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's computer hard drive, containing information about that user. A cookie can only be accessed across the Internet by the web site that placed it there. Cookies are used by the MyOpinions web site to enable web site sign in, and to track the source of new members joining the web site. The use of cookies in this way is wide-spread and commonly accepted by the Internet community. MyOpinions also uses cookies (including third-party cookies) to gather information about users that complete surveys in order to enhance MyOpinions' ability to compile useful data from those surveys.

For example, a MyOpinions or third party cookie may track and correlate a user's MyOpinions ID number together with that member's visit to other web sites containing online ads. This data would then be used to enhance the selection process when inviting users to participate in a survey about those ads. In all instances, cookies used by MyOpinions would not contain personally identifiable information such as your name or email address.

You may choose to reject a cookie that the MyOpinions web site attempts to place on your computer (by using the options and controls in your web browser software), however you may then be limited in your use of some areas of the web site.

## What happens to my personal information on other Web sites?

The MyOpinions web site contains links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our web site and to read the privacy statements of other web sites that you use. This privacy policy applies only to this web site.

## What is "spam" and does MyOpinions send it?

The widely accepted definition of "spam" is unsolicited commercial email, or in other words, email of a commercial nature that the recipient does not want. **MyOpinions does not send "spam".** This is because when you join MyOpinions, you must expressly agree to allow us to send to you survey invitation emails and other emails related to your MyOpinions account.

## How can I stop MyOpinions from sending me email?

Each email we send to you contains a link at the very bottom allowing you to unsubscribe.

If you unsubscribe and cancel your membership, all rewards and prizes will be forfeited. A cancelled account cannot be restored. (For your safety, to cancel your account you must enter your password and confirm this action on the next screen.) [Cancel your account now](https://web.archive.org/account/cancel.aspx).

**If you have received unwanted email sent from MyOpinions,** or purporting to be sent from MyOpinions, please [contact MyOpinions](https://web.archive.org/help/contact.aspx).

**If you have any questions** about the privacy practices of the MyOpinions web site or your dealings with MyOpinions Pty Ltd, please [contact MyOpinions](https://web.archive.org/help/contact.aspx). We are committed to being of service to you and resolving any issues that may arise.

We may change this privacy policy from time to time. You should periodically refer to this policy here to review any changes.

This privacy policy should be read in conjunction with the MyOpinions [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms.aspx).
