# Privacy Policy - MyNewsLA.com

MyNewsLA.com and its owner CalNews Inc. recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about our readers and advertisers. In adopting this privacy policy, our intent is to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using information with your reasonable expectations of privacy.

MyNewsLA.com does not collect personally identifying information about individuals, except when specifically and knowingly provided by those individuals, such as to subscribe to our email newsletters, or to register for a contest or promotion.

Web servers hosting MyNewsLA.com automatically collect anonymous information about which pages you visit, your browser type, IP address,  domain name, interaction with advertising and other data. This is used for internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for traffic audits. We also provide this information about our users on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers.

MyNewsLA.com collects this information by saving a data “cookie” to the browser cache of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information. A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a website. We use the information  track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site without compromising privacy. For example, cookies are used to ensure that you don’t see the same ad too many times.

If you provide your email address in order to receive email newsletters and alerts, we may from time to time send you information about MyNewsLA.com products and services, but will not do so on behalf of third parties. You may unsubscribe at anytime via the link at the bottom of each email message, or by contacting our office by phone or U.S. mail.

Our comments feature is provided in partnership with Facebook and privacy is covered by that company’s policy. You should also be aware that it you voluntarily disclose personal information in comments, that information may be collected by others and may result in unsolicited messages.

If we run contests or promotions on the site, you may be required to provide information such as your telephone number and address in order to participate. The exact rules may vary in each case but the specific rules for any contest will state how that information may be used.

Except as stated in this privacy policy or at the time of collection, a user’s personally identifiable information will not be transferred to a party outside MyNewsLA.com and its hosting providers unless stated at the time of collection.

Note that MyNewsLA.com does not control the privacy policies of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors or other sites to which we provide hyperlinks.

_Special Note to Parents:_ We encourage you to get involved with your children’s online use and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. If we become aware that personal information from a child under 13 has been collected without a parent or guardian’s consent, we will use all reasonable efforts to remove such information from our database.

Technology on the Internet is developing at a rapid pace, and we need to maintain our flexibility in the online arena. If we need to change our policy in the future, we will post these changes as soon as they go into effect.
