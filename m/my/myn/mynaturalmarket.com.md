**Usage tracking**

MyNaturalMarket tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. MyNaturalMarket does break down overall usage statistics according to a users domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every users browser).

MyNaturalMarket sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and dont like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.

**Cookies**

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cant read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.MyNaturalMarket uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above).

When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and dont like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we dont track which terms a particular user enters.

MyNaturalMarket creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we dont track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.
