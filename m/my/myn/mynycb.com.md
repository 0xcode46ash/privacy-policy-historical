Thank you for taking the time to visit New York Community Bank's web site. The Internet offers the safe & convenient new ways to shop for financial services and conduct banking business, any day, at any time. However, we understand that you may be concerned about the privacy of information you provide to us or that is generated as a result of your visit. Be assured that we are committed to your financial well-being and to protecting the privacy and security of your confidential information. To address these issues, New York Community Bank has instituted the following Privacy Policy.

Protecting the privacy and confidentiality of our customer’s personal information is of utmost importance to New York Community Bancorp, Inc. and its family of companies, including New York Community Bank and its divisions; New York Commercial Bank and its division(s), CFS Investments, Inc. (a subsidiary of New York Community Bank), and Standard Funding Corp. (a subsidiary of New York Commercial Bank) (collectively “NYCB”, “our”, “us” or “we”). We value your business and the trust you put in us. To assist us in providing you the quality services and products that you request or to help meet your needs, we gather, maintain and use both public and nonpublic personal information about you on a routine basis. To assist you better in understanding how your personal information is utilized, we are providing you with the following statement describing our policies and practices with respect to the sharing of customer information. In the event that you terminate your customer relationship with us, or become an inactive customer, our privacy policy will continue to apply to you.

**What Information Do We Collect?**  
We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources: 

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms; 
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others; 
  * Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency.



“Nonpublic personal information” means personally identifiable financial information that is not available from public sources. 

**What are our Security Procedures?**   
We understand that the protection of your nonpublic personal information is of the utmost importance. We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who have a business need to know that information, such as to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. Our employees are educated on the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of customer information.

The Internet is a public network. Therefore, it is important to learn how you can safeguard your banking information, credit card numbers, Social Security number and other personal data and, to learn about, and take advantage of security features.

Some examples are: Encryption is the process of scrambling private information to prevent unauthorized access. To show that your transmission is encrypted, some browsers display a small icon on your screen that looks like a "lock" or a "key" whenever you conduct secure transactions online. Avoid sending sensitive information, such as account numbers, through unsecured e-mail. Passwords, access codes or personal identification numbers (PINs) should be used when accessing an account online. Your password should be unique to you and you should change it regularly. Do not use birth dates or other numbers or words that may be easy for others to guess. Always carefully control to whom you give your password. General security over your personal computer such as virus protection and physical access controls should be used and updated regularly. Contact your hardware and software suppliers or Internet service provider to ensure that you have the latest in security updates. 

**What Information Do We Disclose?**   
We may disclose all of the information that we collect, as described above, which includes, but is not limited to, the following kinds of nonpublic personal information: 

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms; such as your name, address, social security number, assets and income.
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others; such as your account balance payment history, parties to transactions, and credit card usage; and
  * Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency; such as your creditworthiness and credit history.

We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to affiliated and nonaffiliated third party companies, which might include financial service providers, retail businesses that we partner with or other businesses that we believe can provide beneficial products or services to you. We may also disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law. We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. 

**Links to Other Sites:**   
As an added convenience to our customers, we may offer online links to merchants, retail stores and other non-financial sites. Please remember that an outside website may not be secure and the company's products and services are not insured by the FDIC. We cannot guarantee your privacy or the products and services. As in everyday business, before you order a product or service online, make sure you are comfortable with the reputation of the company making the offer. Only then should you release any personal information such as your Account number, Social Security number or Credit Card or Check Card number. 

**Children's Information:**   
New York Community Bank makes every effort to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. We do not knowingly collect or retain personally identifiable information from customers under the age of 13.

**Your Right To Opt-Out**

If you choose to opt-out you may not receive certain information on products or services that may be of interest to you. The Fair Credit Reporting Act also allows you to opt out from NYCB sharing non-transaction or other information (such as consumer credit report information) with affiliates.
