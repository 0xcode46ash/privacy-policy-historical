or services to you. We may also disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties as
permitted or required by law. We may also disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to companies
that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing
agreements.

Data” (as defined above) with nonaffiliated third parties will generally require your consent (unless such sharing is
otherwise required or permitted by law).
What Are Our Security Procedures?
We understand that the protection of your nonpublic personal information is of the utmost importance. We restrict
access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who have a business need to know the
information, such as to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural
safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. Our employees are
educated on the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of customer information.
