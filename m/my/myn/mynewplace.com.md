# Privacy Policy | MyNewPlace

[](http://www.truste.com/ivalidate.php?url=www.mynewplace.com&sealid=101)

Effective April 24, 2006 (Updated September 16, 2010)

Protecting the privacy of our users is very important to MyNewPlace.  When you register at MyNewPlace.com, the Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us is used to provide the services you have registered for, to deliver email notifications to you, and from time to time, to validate your identity.  Our data collection policies allow you to choose how much information you provide to us, and to control how we use that Personally Identifiable Information as set forth below.  To find out more, please read on.

 **Information Collection & Use**

Multifamily Technology Solutions, Inc. wants your experience to be satisfying and safe.  Our data collection policies allow you to choose how much information you provide to us, and what MyNewPlace does with the information you supply. Your Personally Identifiable Information will be kept within MyNewPlace unless you consent to our supplying all or a portion of your information to third parties as a part of one of our service offerings or as set forth below.  MyNewPlace collects information online to allow you to use our services.  Depending on the service you are accessing, you could be asked at various times to provide information such as your name, email address, contact phone number or other information related to of the property you are seeking. We request this information to deliver on the services you are requesting, and to allow us to provide our strongest value to you - a personalized online experience. Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable:

  1. Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that thousands of people have visited this Privacy Policy webpage, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of birth.  What we collect from visits such as this constitutes anonymous information.  Some of the individuals who access our services decline to use the personalization features that are available to them, and therefore those individuals are anonymous to us and the only data we collect about them is anonymous information.
  2. Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, email address or phone number.  While you can search and browse some sections of our web site without being a registered user, certain activities do require registration, such as viewing and saving properties.  Registering with MyNewPlace using the web form or Login with Facebook button will also cause a cookie to be issued; this cookie allows MyNewPlace to “recognize” you when you are on our site to allow us to personalize our service for you.



 **Anonymous Information**

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  We may link this automatically-collected data to certain Personally Identifiable Information.

We use third-party tracking services through Omniture that use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. For information regarding Omniture’s data collection and privacy practices, please visit [**http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/policy**](http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/policy).

 **Personally Identifiable Information**

In order to use the basic features of this Web site, you need not register or provide any personal information. However, if you wish to save any properties you’ve located, view specific details of a property or contact a property for information, you must first complete the registration form and create a user name and password or use the Login with Facebook button.  During registration you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address) as well as the time frame in which you intend to move.  If you use the Login with Facebook button, Facebook will make certain personally identifiable information available to us, such as your name, current city, and email address after you choose to allow us access. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.  When you register with MyNewPlace, the information you provide to us is used to provide the service for which you have registered.  Depending on the services you have chosen to use, some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information may be used by MyNewPlace to provide such services.  Personally Identifiable Information may also be provided to intermediaries and third parties who assist MyNewPlace in providing you with the service upon your request. For example, if you register and desire to contact a property, some of your personally identifiable information may be shown to the property (e.g., contact information and time frame for moving). Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, however, MyNewPlace will not rent or sell your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties without your permission.

MyNewPlace is the sole owner of the information collected on www.mynewplace.com.  MyNewPlace may collect Personally Identifiable Information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

 **Access to Personally Identifiable Information**

You can update your Personal Identifiable Information at [**www.mynewplace.com/myaccount**](http://www.mynewplace.com/myaccount)or by contacting us at consumercare@mynewplace.com.

 **Requesting removal of your information or Unsubscribing from email**

You may unsubscribe from our emails at [**www.mynewplace.com/emailprefs**](http://www.mynewplace.com/emailprefs) or by clicking on the unsubscribe links at the bottom of our emails. You may also request the removal of your information by contacting us via e-mail at consumercare@mynewplace.com.

 **Special Offers and Updates**

We may occasionally send you information on services, special deals, products and/or promotions.

 **Service-related Announcements**

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.

 **Customer Service**

Based upon the Personally Identifiable Information you provide us, we may send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, if you have provided such information.

 **Profile**

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, or clear gifs to create a profile of your preferences. We may tie your Personally Identifiable Information to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site for you.

 **Surveys**

From time-to-time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site.  If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.  Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

We use this information to learn more about the wants and needs of different types of users (recent college grads vs. corporate relocators, for example) and to improve our site and email program.

We will not share the Personally Identifiable Information you provide through a survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice or as otherwise set forth herein.

 **Blog/Testimonials**

If you use a blog or testimonial on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  For testimonials, we do obtain the customer’s consent prior to posting their name along with their testimonial.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.  If you want to remove your personal information that is being displayed on our website under public pages, please contact us at consumercare@mynewplace.com.

 **Tell-A-Friend**

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  MyNewPlace.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email (and tracking the success of our referral program).

Your friend may contact us at consumercare@mynewplace.com to request that we remove this information from our database.

 **TRUSTe**

MyNewPlace.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build user’s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the Web site www.mynewplace.com. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Director of Marketing via email at consumercare@mynewplace.com. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at [**http://www.truste.com/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php**](http://www.truste.com/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php) TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.

 **Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a users computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We may link the information we store in cookies to any Personally Identifiable Information you submit while on our site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s help file.

We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as saving properties, will be limited.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any business partners or advertisers on our web site.  See Third Party Advertisers.

 **Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**

We may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customer’s Personally Identifiable Information.  We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

 **Third Party Advertisers**

The ads appearing on this web site, if any, may be delivered to users by third-party advertising companies.  Third-party advertising companies may use cookies and clear GIFs on this site, which allow it to recognize a user’s cookie when a user visits this site.  The companies serve their ads from their own web sites, independently from MyNewPlace.  The information that the third-party advertising companies collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable, unless you provide such information in response to an advertisement.

 **Links to Other Sites**

This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by MyNewPlace. Please be aware that we, MyNewPlace, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this web site.

 **Framing**

This Web site utilizes framing techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the site when the user is actually on a third party Web site.  For example, if you are on a page that has the look and feel of www.mynewplace.com, but the URL listed in your browser is a different URL than www.mynewplace.com, then know that the information is being collected by this third party and their Privacy Policy governs the collection and use of this information.

 **Share This**

When you use “Share This” to bookmark and share our products and site, you will be taken to a third party site.  Please note that these third party sites’ privacy policies govern the collection and use of the information collected on those sites.

 **Security**

MyNewPlace operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.  You the consumer are ultimately responsible for the security of your MyNewPlace Member Name and password.  Please take care to store your Member Name separately from your account password, or better yet, choose a password that you don’t need to write down at all.

 **Business Transitions**

In the event MyNewPlace goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets as well as in the event of a bankruptcy, assignment for benefit of creditors or receivership, your personally identifiable information may be disclosed and will likely be among the assets transferred.  You will be notified via prominent notice on our web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

 **Legal Disclaimer**

We reserve the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site.

 **Your Privacy Rights Regarding Data Shared with Third Party Service Providers**

To help service your requests and only where you have explicitly granted permission to do so (i.e., when you use our service to send an email to a property or as set forth herein), we may provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to third parties who may use this information for their own purposes, including sending advertising to you.

There are also certain instances when it may be advantageous for MyNewPlace to make certain limited Personally Identifiable Information about you available to companies that MyNewPlace has a relationship with or that have provided services to you.  These companies may help us process information, manage and enhance customer data, and assess your use of our services.  These companies are also obligated to protect any of your personal information, except if we inform you otherwise at the time of collection.

For more information about a third party service provider, or to learn more about the choices related to the transfer of this information, or the process to opt-out of these transactions please contact us via e-mail at consumercare@mynewplace.com.

 **Changes in this Privacy Statement**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, or by means of a notice on our home page.
