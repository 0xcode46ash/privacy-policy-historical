**What about cookies?**

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive or in its memory. The main McGraw-Hill Education Web site does not make use of cookies. Some areas of the Web site may use cookies and our subscription products use "session" cookies; in those areas, an explanation of the use of cookies can be reached by clicking on the Privacy Notice links on the affected Web pages. A "session" cookie is a cookie that is erased from memory when a visitor's browser closes.

Customers may choose not to accept cookies. In order to change these cookie preferences, you must change your browser's preferences to disable cookies or delete cookies. Please note that disabling cookies for some services will impact ability to use that service. To change your browser's preferences in Internet Explorer (versions 6 and up), this option is listed under Tools > Internet Options > Privacy. The setting has to be set to Block All Cookies. In Netscape (versions 7 and up), this option is listed under Edit > Preferences > Privacy & Security > Cookies. The Disable Cookies button should be checked. Security information is specific to each browser and operating system. Please check with your browser's specific company for more information.

**IP Addresses**

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to audit the use of our site. When visitors request pages from McGraw-Hill Education, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers, or others
