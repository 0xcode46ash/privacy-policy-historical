### Thank you for your interest in McGraw-Hill products and services.

When you register with the McGraw-Hill Professional bookstore under our SIGN UP area, subscribe to any of our newsletters, or opt-in to receive special offers and new releases sent to your email address, your contact information (including your name, address and e-mail address as requested) is added to our secure database located in the United States and access is limited to authorized persons.

From time to time, we will send you information about new titles, features, additions, and changes to McGraw-Hill Professional's products and services.

Occasionally, and subject to applicable laws, McGraw-Hill Professional also makes contact information available to other business units within The McGraw-Hill Companies whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you.

On rare occasions, and subject to applicable laws, McGraw-Hill Professional may also share your information with outside "3rd Party" vendors who will be authorized to use this information solely to perform services (such as a "mailing" house) on our behalf.

If at any time you would like your name removed from lists that are used for any of these purposes, simply access the [Opt-Out form](), and follow the simple instructions for prompt removal of your name.

If you contact us in regard to technical support, questions about your order, or any general inquiry, your email address will only be used in response to your inquiry. Your email address will not be added to our database.

If you do not enroll in an email update service, or if you unsubscribe to an email update service, you will still receive email updates regarding any order you may have placed.
