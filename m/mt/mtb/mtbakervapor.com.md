# Privacy Policy

### Introduction

A good business relationship is based upon mutual trust. This includes your relationship with MtBakerVapor.com. To promote mutual trust, we take your privacy very seriously. Read the information below to learn more about our privacy policy.

### What This Policy Covers

This policy covers how MtBakerVapor.com (“we”) treats personal information that we collect regarding visitors and users (“you”) of the MtBakerVapor.com site. Personal Information is defined as identification information about you such as your name, address, email address, and phone number that is not otherwise publicly available.

### The Information That We Collect About You

On MtBakerVapor.com you have almost total control over what information we may have about you. In most cases, we will not have personal information about you unless you voluntarily give it to us when establishing an account, placing an order, etc. This information includes, name, address, email address, shipping address, telephone number, credit card information, and any other information that we may consider necessary to serve you properly. (For example, we cannot deliver merchandise that you have ordered unless we have an address to deliver it to.) You may choose not to provide this information. However, a decision not to provide the information we request may mean that we are unable to process your order.

You may provide us with information about other individuals (for example, you may request shipping to another individual and their address). We will safeguard this information as carefully as we would your own information. We also retain the same right to use this information as we would use your information (for example, we may need to contact them regarding shipping, we may contact them with information about offers and products we believe they may be interested in, etc.)

The only personal information we collect from you without requesting it is your IP (Internet Protocol) address and the identity of the web site you visited prior to visiting MtBakerVapor.com. Your IP address is the number which the internet uses to identify you while you use the internet. This number does not provide us with other information about you (such as name, address, etc.). However, if it is important for us to contact you, your IP address may be used to identify your internet provider and you may be contacted through that channel. This will only be done if we have a significant need to contact you and we do not otherwise have accurate contact information. We identify the site you visited prior to our site to acquire knowledge of sites which may be providing links to MtBakerVapor.com.

### How We Use Your Information

(For example, we need to share your credit card information with our financial institution in order to receive payment, a merchant needs to know your shipping information in order to ship merchandise to you. When your merchandise is shipped, the selected carrier must have access to your shipping information in order to make the delivery.)
