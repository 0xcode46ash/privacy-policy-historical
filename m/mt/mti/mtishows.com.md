Thank you for visiting one of the MTI Sites. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

**The Information We Collect**

At some MTI sites, you may be able to order services or products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services or participate in one of our online bulletin boards or other exchanges. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, type and size of organization, and information about your proposed performances, such as audience size, dates and ticket prices. We may also ask about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. You will know when personally identifiable information is collected by MTI because you will have to fill out a form. Of course, if you want to remain completely anonymous, you‘re still free to take advantage of the wealth of content available on our sites. 

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (such as Netscape or Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (such as Windows ME or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (such as America Online or Earthlink). 

**A Note to Parents and Children**

We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from any user under the age of 13, nor do we require disclosure of any information from any user beyond that which may reasonably necessary for participation in a particular activity on our Sites. E-mail addresses, first names, grade in school or ages may be obtained from postings on bulletin boards and other exchanges, but we will not maintain such information or use it for marketing purposes. If a contest is run for our users under age 13 and we must notify a winning contestant, or if we offer any products for sale to children, we will require the verified permission of a parent or guardian at the time of submission of any personally identifiable information on a form for that minor user. 

MTI is under no obligation to monitor or review any bulletin boards or other exchanges and assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever arising from the content of any such postings. Any such posting will be treated by MTI as non-confidential and non-proprietary. Please keep in mind that whenever you or your children give out personal information online in community forums, such as via bulletin boards, such information can be collected and used by people you do not know. While MTI strives to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose publicly online; you make such disclosures at your own risk. When participating in any user-generated content area, never assume that people are who they say they are, know what they say they know, or are affiliated with whom they say they are affiliated. We cannot be responsible for the content or accuracy of any information set forth on any bulletin board or other exchange. 

**How We Use the Information that We Collect**

We may use the information you provide about yourself or your organization to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you. 

We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests, to fulfill a request by you for a product or service, or to contact you about your account with us. 

The information we may collect in connection with our online bulletin boards and other exchanges is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online bulletin boards and other exchanges and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services. 

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services. 

We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency‘s request. 

Agents and contractors of MTI who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for MTI. 

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data. 

**Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites**

The MTI Sites may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites‘ privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. 

**How You can Access or Correct Information**

For instructions on how you can access the personally identifiable information that this MTI site has collected about you online, or how to correct factual errors in such information, please send an email, along with your first and last name to Contest@MTIshows.com. To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. Parents may review any personally identifiable information that we have collected regarding their children by so notifying us at the email address set forth above or by regular mail at the address given in the next paragraph and may request that we delete such information.
