Contact information which you supply in a registration form or on-line survey via a website is used to get in touch with you when necessary, for example when you request the publication of notice of an event or seek information about a course offered by the University. For certain applications, for example the on-line calendar of events, your details will be published when you are indicated to be the contact person for a particular event. Data collected via an on-line survey will be used only for stated purposes, as approved by the University Human Ethics Committee.

The University may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with a server, to administer a web site or to set up individual sessions to provide secure logins.
