### Overview

Macquarie University is about discovery, learning and participation in a borderless world. We are a dynamic, flexible and engaged university committed to excellence in research, teaching and global citizenship. In undertaking its learning and teaching, research, and community engagement functions, the University collects, stores, and uses a broad range of personal and health information relating to students (including prospective, current and alumni), staff, patients and others who interact with it.

Macquarie University is committed to protecting the privacy of its students, employees and others who interact with it while undertaking its learning and teaching, research, engagement, and associated administrative activities and support services.

The University is required to comply with the [NSW _Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998_ ( **PPIPA** ) ](http://www.ipc.nsw.gov.au/ppip-act "PPIPA link ")and[ _Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002_ ( **HRIPA** ) ](https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2002/71 "link ")in respect of personal and health information which it collects and uses. The University aligns its practices and activities with the Information Protection Principles (IPPs), and the Health Privacy Principles (HPPs) contained in those Acts.

The University’s[ Privacy Management Plan](https://www.mq.edu.au/about/about-the-university/governance/privacy/Privacy-Management-Plan-FINAL.pdf "Privacy plan 2017") provides more information on how the University implements its obligations under the PPIPA and HRIPA, and how these Acts apply to the University’s operations.

### Controlled entities

Controlled entities of the University that are considered “organisations” under the Commonwealth Privacy Act must comply with the following privacy acts:

  *  _[Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act)](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014C00076 "Privacy ")_
  *  _[Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 (NSW) (PPIPA)](http://www.ipc.nsw.gov.au/ppip-act "PPIPA")_
  *  _[Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002 (NSW) (HRIPA)](https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2002/71 "link ")_



The University’s controlled entities must have a separate Privacy Policy that explains the types of personal and/or health information that it collects and holds, how it does so and the purposes for that collection, to whom it discloses that information, how your information can be accessed or corrected, how you can make a privacy complaint and how that will be actioned, whether your information is likely to be sent overseas and to which countries if applicable.

The following controlled entities have their own Privacy Policy :

  * U@MQ Ltd (Campus Life/Sports and Recreation) - <http://www.mq.edu.au/about/about-the-university/offices-and-units/campus-life/privacy-policy>


  * Macquarie University Hospital - <http://muh.org.au/privacy-policy>


  * Macquarie University Clinical Associates Ltd – [www.mqhealth.org.au](http://www.mqhealth.org.au/)



 **What if there are inconsistencies between the Commonwealth Privacy Act and the NSW privacy acts that apply to controlled entities?**

The Commonwealth Privacy Act contemplates that an entity may have duties under both Commonwealth and State privacy legislation such as a controlled entity of the University. To the extent there are inconsistencies between the Commonwealth Privacy Act and the NSW privacy acts for controlled entities, the Commonwealth Privacy Act will prevail.
