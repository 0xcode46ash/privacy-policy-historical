# MOSIS Web Site Privacy Statement

### Web Server Logs

We maintain standard web server transaction logs, which include the IP address and time of day, and the specific web page associated with requests received by our web server. We use this information only to monitor the way visitors navigate our pages, so that we might improve the organization of the site, and for the purpose of detecting and correcting server problems, including malicious intrusions and attacks. 

### Cookies

Although we do not use cookies at this time, any future implementation of cookies will be only to track users within the MOSIS web site, to facilitate our recognition of MOSIS users on return visits, and to maintain session-specific data for the convenience of MOSIS customers. This information will be used only within MOSIS, and will not be made available to anyone outside MOSIS. 

### Personal Information

MOSIS does not collect or maintain any information about MOSIS users beyond that required to conduct our business. Most of this essential information refers to the commercial concerns, governmental organizations, and educational institutions that hold accounts with MOSIS, and not to individuals. 

We request e-mail addresses in order to facilitate communications with designers and account liaisons. Interested persons may voluntarily give us their e-mail address so that they can receive the occasional announcements that MOSIS distributes to our user community. Account contact and newsletter e-mail address lists are never disclosed outside MOSIS or made available to any other organization or institution. 

Participants in the MOSIS Educational Program may be asked, as a condition of participation, to permit disclosure by MOSIS of some general information about their submitted and fabricated designs. 

### External Links

MOSIS provides links to other web sites that we think may be useful to VLSI designers. MOSIS is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of any of these linked sites. 

### Comments and Questions

Please direct any comments or questions regarding the MOSIS Web Site Privacy Policy to the [MOSIS Webmaster](mailto:webmaster@mosis.com).
