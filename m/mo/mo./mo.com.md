### Brian’s Favorite Quotes:

“If you wish success in life, make perseverance your bosom friend, experience your wise counselor, caution your elder brother and hope your guardian genius.” 

\- Joseph Addison 

"It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat." 

\- Theodore Roosevelt 

"I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed." 

\- Michael Jordan 

Entrepreneurs are simply those who understand there is little difference between obstacle and opportunity, and are able to turn both to their advantage. 

\- Niccolo Machiavelli 

‎Ability is what you're capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it. -Lou Holtz
