# Privacy | Mozy

Mozy, Inc. (“Mozy,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) has created this Privacy Statement because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared.

### Disclosing Personal Information

We may share Personal Information with Dell Inc. and other corporate affiliates—businesses in the Dell Technologies group of companies—to carry out transactions you request, to make our business or that of our corporate affiliates more responsive to your needs, including so that our corporate affiliates may provide you with information about those affiliates’ products and services, or for research or analysis. 

In addition, Mozy may share your Personal Information with participants in our sales and marketing chain, including but not limited to retailers, resellers, distributors, integrators, order fulfillers and sales agents (“Channel Partners”), for the purposes of selling, marketing or providing support for Mozy products and services.

We may share your Personal Information with affiliates or Business Partners to carry out transactions you request, or to make our business or that of our affiliates more responsive to your needs, which includes our affiliates and Business Partners providing you with information about Mozy products and services. We will only share Personal Information with Business Partners who share Mozy’s commitment to protecting your Personal Information.

We may share information with a purchaser of all or part of Mozy, Dell Inc., or our corporate affiliates.

Except as described above, we will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties for their own marketing purposes without your consent.

We may aggregate or de-identify information so that it does not identify you and share that and other non-personal information with third parties for any purpose.

### Selecting Your Communication Preferences and Accessing Your Personal Information

If you do not wish to receive future marketing communications, or wish to change, modify or delete your Personal Information, please contact us at [privacy@Mozy.com](mailto:%70%72%69%76%61%63%79%40%4d%6f%7a%79%2e%63%6f%6d "privacy@Mozy.com"). Upon receipt of your request, your information will be updated as soon as possible, but no later than ten (10) days after our receipt of your request.

Even when you opt out of receiving marketing communications, we may still communicate with you in connection with servicing your account, fulfilling your request, or administering any promotion or any program in which you have elected to participate.

### Collection and Use of Children’s Personal Information

Mozy takes children’s privacy seriously. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 through our Website. If you are under 18 years of age, please do not submit any Personal Information through our Website without the express consent and participation of a parent or guardian.

### How We Use Cookies

Our Website uses “cookies” to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a piece of text that is placed on your computer’s hard drive. Depending on the settings you have selected, your browser adds the text to your device as a small file. You can change the browser settings as described below; many browsers are set to accept cookies by default. We use cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter the same information repeatedly.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Many web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of our Website and services that depend on cookies.

### Analytics / Log Files

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information in order to personalize our communications with you.

### Targeted Display Advertising by Mozy and Others

Mozy also works with third party advertising and personalization partners that use cookies to help us display personalized content and appropriate advertising during your visits to our Website and other websites. Cookies placed by our third party partners also assist us with measuring the performance of our advertising campaigns.

### How We Use Web Beacons

Mozy or third parties with which we have contracted or sub-contracted may use web beacons on our website, in our email messages, in our advertisements on other websites, or in our advertisements in others’ email messages. Similarly, third parties whose content or ads appear on our Website, may also place web beacons in their ads or emails for purposes of measuring the effectiveness of the content, ads or email messages.

A web beacon is an electronic image that can be used to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view a web page or email message. Web beacons help us measure the effectiveness of our Website and our advertising in various ways. For example, web beacons may count the number of individuals who visit our Website from a particular advertisement, or who make a purchase from our Website after viewing a particular advertisement, or they may tell us when a web page is viewed and provide a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons may also measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns, by counting the number of individuals who open or act upon an email message, determining when an email message is opened and determining how many times an email message is forwarded.

The information we collect through web beacons may include some limited Personal Information, and web beacons allow us to recognize users by accessing Mozy cookies. We may also combine the information that we collect through web beacons with other information we have collected from you. We use all of this information to better tailor our marketing to you and may use this information for other purposes, such as to enable a shopping cart, customize content on our Website and undertake internal research.

We prohibit web beacons on our sites from being used by third parties to access Personal Information. We may allow third parties to compile individual information or aggregated statistics from the use of web beacons on our site by Mozy, its agents or others, to enable such third parties to determine the effectiveness of online marketing and to allow such third parties to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser’s site. Aggregate information is anonymous and may include demographic and usage information. No Personal Information about you is shared with partners for this research.

You can make some web beacons unusable by rejecting cookies.

### Retention of Client Data

Mozy will retain Client Data for as long as needed to provide services to our client, unless otherwise directed by that client, and as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### How We Secure Personal Information

Mozy is committed to protecting the security of Personal Information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, Mozy cannot ensure or guarantee that the Personal Information or private communications you transmit to us will always remain confidential or secure. Therefore, when you choose to provide Personal Information or private communications to us, you do so at your own risk.

### Links to External Websites

Our Website may contain links to third-party sites. Mozy cannot control and is not responsible for the privacy practices of such third-party sites. Mozy encourages users to be aware when they leave our Website, and to read the privacy statements of each website they visit. This Privacy Statement applies only to Mozy.

### Blog / Forum

Our Website offers publicly-accessible blogs or community forums. Please be aware that any information you provide in these blogs or forums may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your Personal Information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [privacy@Mozy.com](mailto:%70%72%69%76%61%63%79%40%4d%6f%7a%79%2e%63%6f%6d "privacy@Mozy.com"). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

### Social Media Widgets

Our Website includes social media features, such as a Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the “Share this” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Website. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it, not by this Privacy Statement.

### Changes to This Privacy Statement

Mozy reserves the right to change this Privacy Statement at any time. If Mozy materially changes its Privacy Statement, we will either notify users via e-mail or via a prominent notice posted on our Website prior to the change becoming effective. Changes are effective as of the date we post them on the Mozy Privacy Statement page. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement.
