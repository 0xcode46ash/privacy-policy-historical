**LAST UPDATED: February 14, 2014** ****

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect your Personal Data (defined below) on those web sites of Moody’s and its service providers that post or link directly to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Site”) and through offline means, how we protect such data, and the choices you have concerning our use of such data. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Moody’s may from time to time update this Privacy Policy. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post or link to the revised Privacy Policy on the Site. Please review the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the top of this page to determine when this Privacy Policy was most recently revised. 

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Moody’s”, "we", "us", and "our" means Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and their affiliates. A complete list of Moody’s group affiliates can be found on the [www.moodys.com](http://www.moodys.com/) web site. ****

Moody's Corporation and its U.S. subsidiaries adhere to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union member countries and Switzerland to the U.S. Moody’s Corporation and its U.S. subsidiaries have certified that they adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. For more information about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Moody’s Corporation and its U.S. subsidiaries’ certification, please visit _<http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>_.  

You do not have to provide us with any Personal Data to visit the Site. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit all sections or use all features of the Site.

This Privacy Policy shall apply to any Moody’s mobile application and other forms of Moody’s online activity that reference this Privacy Policy. In such instances, the term “Site” shall include the applicable mobile application or other Moody’s online activity whenever that term is used herein. In connection with your use of any Moody’s mobile application, your Personal Data may also be collected and used by your mobile device manufacturer, the mobile application store from which you obtained the Moody’s mobile application, your telecommunication provider, or other third parties involved in the delivery of the application or data to your mobile device, and such practices shall be subject to the privacy policy of the applicable third party. Moody’s is not responsible for any third party’s privacy practices. 

**Types of Data Collected**

We gather Personal Data and Other Data (as described below). ****

**Collection of Personal Data**

Personal data is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you, e.g., your name, email address, address, or phone number ("Personal Data"). 

• Moody’s requests Personal Data from you when you register on the Site. The registration process requests that you provide your name, business email address, business address, business phone number, and company affiliation, and agree to the User Agreement presented at the time of registration. 

• Moody’s may collect Personal Data voluntarily provided by you, including in emails to the Site, online forms, order and registration forms, surveys, promotion participation, and through offline means. 

• On some of Moody’s Sites, including _[www.moodys.com](http://www.moodys.com/)_ and [www.moodysanalytics.com](http://www.moodysanalytics.com/), you are able to maintain "portfolios", listing financial instruments in which you have a special interest. Providing this information is always at your option. If you provide such information, you will be required to select a username and a password. To be useful, this information must be stored on the Site, and is accessible to anyone with whom you share your username and password. For this reason, please safeguard your username and password carefully and do not disclose it to any other person. 

• 

We may use third-party payment services (each, a "Payment Service") to collect payments made through the Site. If you wish to make a payment through the Site, you may be directed to a webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service (or the Payment Service's service providers) and not by Moody’s. Any Personal Data that you provide through a Payment Service page will be collected by Payment Service and not by Moody’s, and will be subject to Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. Moody’s has no control over, and is not responsible for, Payment Service's use of information collected through the Payment Service Page. 

• 

Moody’s collects offline information through various means, including participation at conferences, individual introductions, and from employers that enroll their employees in our services. From time to time, we may also acquire from third parties certain lists containing the names and contact information of individuals who may be interested in our products and services. If we acquire such a list for promotional purposes, we seek to obtain appropriate representations from the other party that the listed individuals have opted in to receiving promotional messages from any acquirer of such list. 

**Use of Personal Data Collected**

_We may use Personal Data for the following purposes:_

• Fulfillment of Requests. Moody’s may use Personal Data about you to deliver products and services, and provide you with information about products and services you’ve ordered.  

• Other Communications. From time to time, we may use Personal Data about you to inform you of products, programs, services and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. If your employer is a Moody’s customer, we may also inform you of such products, programs, services and promotions using Personal Data about you that your employer provided to Moody’s. If you would prefer that we not send electronic marketing messages to you, please see the "Your Choices" section below.

• Promotions. We may operate sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions (collectively, "Promotions"). We typically ask you for certain Personal Data when you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion. You should carefully review the rules of each Promotion in which you participate, as they may contain additional important information about our use of Personal Data about you. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of Personal Data about you conflict with this Privacy Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control. 

• Internal Business Purposes. We may also use Personal Data about you for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, editorial and feedback purposes, providing customer support, customizing and improving the content and layout of the Site, completing business transactions, development of marketing and promotion plans and materials, statistical analysis of user behavior, product development, administering individual accounts, and meeting government regulatory requirements such as sales tax collection, audits, etc.

• Administrative Communications. In addition, Moody’s reserves the right to use Personal Data to send to you important information regarding the Site, your account status, changes to the User Agreement, this Privacy Policy, or any other policies, agreements or transactions relevant to your use of the Site. Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications.

Unless combined with Personal Data, Monitoring Data does not personally identify you or any other user, and we may use it for any purpose.

• Tools. We and our service providers may also use various common Internet tools such as 'pixel tags,' ‘action tags,’ ‘web beacons,’ ‘.gif tags,’ 'JavaScript' or similar technologies (together, "Tools") in connection with Site pages and email messages in certain formats to among other things, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, to determine the success of marketing campaigns and to compile statistics about Site usage and response rates. Tools allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in email messages in certain formats, Tools can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened.Moody’s uses cookies and Tool technologies to understand how the Site is used and to customize and enhance the Internet experience of individual users. When you revisit the Site, Moody’s may recognize you by a Tool and customize your experience.
