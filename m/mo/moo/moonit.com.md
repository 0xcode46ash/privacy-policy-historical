# privacy policy | Moonit

Moonit LLC ("Moonit," "we" or "our company") has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to privacy which governs our flagship Website Moonit.com. We realize the importance of feeling safe online and want you to feel comfortable using our personalized services and exchanging information on [Moonit.com](http://moonit.com/). We are committed to protecting your personal information and will take reasonable steps to see that this privacy policy is followed within our company. The statement below outlines the privacy practices solely for the Website located at [www.Moonit.com](http://moonit.com/) and not for any other product or service. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and subject to, the terms and conditions of our Terms of Service.

### I.INFORMATION COLLECTED

In order to provide you with personalized services and features, we ask you to register and establish your personal profile. During the registration process we will ask you for information such as your name, gender, birth-related information, e-mail address, password and zip code. This information is used to calculate an accurate natal chart and provide you with the best possible personalized service over time. Your e-mail address, together with a password, is used to secure your profile and to make our personalized e-mail services available to you.

We collect many different types of non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities on our site through your IP address or most-recently-visited URL. However, we do not collect any personally identifiable information directly from you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us, by using our products and services or by filling out a form or short survey through our progressive profiling process.

Personally identifiable information is primarily collected to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services. Depending on the part of the service you are accessing, you could be asked to provide information such as name, gender, e-mail address, birth date, birth location and time of birth (to the extent available). Customers who personalize our service come back regularly, so we do everything we can to make [Moonit.com](http://moonit.com/) your service and give you just the content you wish to receive.  
The Moonit.com Website is not targeted toward, nor intended for use by, minors (which means, in most jurisdictions, those under the age of 18). Therefore, children those under the age of 18 will not be permitted to register and establish a personal profile on the Moonit Website.

### II.USE OF INFORMATION

The personally identifiable information voluntarily provided by you is used and shared as described in this policy, including to:

  1. provide you with the services or products you have requested from us;
  2. send you promotional offers for various products and services via email;
  3. permit our vendors and contractors to access your information, but they are only allowed to use such personal information in connection with the services they provide for the Website; or
  4. enable you to post and transmit information about yourself at your discretion.



We may also obtain information about you from third parties and use that information to enhance the information that we already have about you. For instance, if we just have your name and email address, we may use a third party to obtain your telephone number and physical address. All of the combined information will be used in accordance with this policy.

Please note that we reserve the right to access and/or disclose personal information and non-personal information we gather as required by courts or administrative agencies and to the extent required to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, our Website's Terms of Service, or the rights of third parties or to investigate any suspected conduct which we deem improper. We may also disclose and/or transfer your personal information in connection with a sale, merger or reorganization of all or a part of Moonit.

Non-personally identifiable information about you may be shared by us with any number of third parties, and those third parties may use that information for our benefit or for their own benefit. However, such information will not specifically identify you.

### III.ONLINE COMMUNICATIONS IN PUBLIC FORUMS

You should be aware that personally identifiable information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a posting, comment, public profile or other public forum may be viewed and used by others. We are unable to control such uses of your personally identifiable information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the personally identifiable information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties. You also assume the risk that you might be exposed to objectionable content and conduct by using public forums such as these. You agree not to hold Moonit responsible for the content or actions of other users of the Website.

However, if at any time in the future we plan to use personally identifiable information in a way that materially differs from this policy, we will post such changes here and provide you the opportunity to opt out of such differing uses. Your continued use of the Website following the posting of any changes to this policy means you accept such changes.
