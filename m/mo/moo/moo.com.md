# Privacy and Cookie Policy | MOO (United States)

**Last Modified: June 2016**

MOO (“Moo”, “we”, “us” or “our”) values your privacy. (We know everyone says this, but we really mean it.) This Privacy Policy explains how we use, share and protect the personally identifiable information that we collect about you (“Personal Information”) and the choices you have. This Privacy Policy applies to visitors to www.moo.com website (the “Website”) and to our online customers. By visiting or using our Website, you agree to this Privacy Policy. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information about you collected by our affiliates or third party websites that may post links or advertisements on or otherwise be accessible from the Website. The information collected by these affiliates or third party websites is subject to their own privacy policies (which we assume are as thorough as ours!).

The data controller is:   
• MOO Inc. of 14 Blackstone Valley Place, Lincoln, RI 02865, USA, in respect of individuals who are residents of North America; or  
• MOO Print Limited of 2nd Floor, 20 Farringdon Road, London, EC1M 3AF, UK, in respect of individuals who are residents of a country located outside of North America (e.g. Europe and Australia). MOO Print Limited has the UK Data Protection Registration Number Z9441126, unless otherwise indicated in a contract we enter into with you (and if that happens, we will be 100% upfront!)

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We collect a variety of information about our wonderful customers (you!) and visitors to the Website. 

Information Collected Automatically: Whenever you visit our Website, we automatically collect (non invasive) information about you, namely:

• your transactions with us, for example, the type of product you purchased and the costs of each product;  
• your use of our Website and the device you use to access our Website, for example, your IP address, the type of operating system and web browser you use and related information; and your activities on our Website, such as the pages you visit.

**INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US**

• if you provide us with Personal Information by filling out a form, registering for an account, making a purchase, or contacting us, we collect that Personal Information. For example, if you register on our Website, we collect your name, e-mail address and password;  
• if you place an order with us, we collect the Personal Information that you provide to us such as your shipping, billing, and payment information. See the ‘Credit and Payment Card information’ section below to read more about how we and our partners handle your payment information;  
• if you design and personalize a product, such as a business card, we collect the Personal Information you use to customize the product, such as the name of your business, your telephone number and professional title;  
• if you contact our customer services agents, you may also provide us with Personal Information that we collect. From time-to-time, MOO may give you the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes, contests or surveys on our Website;  
• if you participate, we will collect certain Personal Information from you. Participation in these sweepstakes, surveys or contests is completely voluntary (promise!) and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose the requested information; and  
• if you take the opportunity to review our products (please be kind!) or participate in public forums associated with the Website, we will collect Personal Information in any such reviews, posts or comments. Note that these will be public so you should use care before posting information about yourself online (that’s just good advice in general).

Additional Information We Collect: From time to time, we may acquire additional information about our customers from third parties, such as the Postal Service and third parties that assist us in the provision of products and services requested by you.

**CREDIT AND PAYMENT CARD INFORMATION**

MOO uses third party payment processors Digital River World Payments and PayPal to process payments made for products and services via the Website. All online payments will be conducted in accordance with Payment Card Industry (PCI) data security standards (which are high!) and your billing information (which is only used by these payment processors for the purpose of performing fraud protection) is encrypted before being communicated to them. Subject to the below exceptions, your credit card details are communicated directly from your browser to these payment processors - MOO never (ever!) sees your full Permanent Account Number (PAN). This means that the payment form is either off-site or displayed in a frame on the payment page.

For Digital River World Payments, if on the payment page you have requested that your card details be remembered (it’s such a timesaver!) and the payment was successful, MOO stores the card type, a Masked PAN (only the first 6 and last 4 digits) and the card’s expiry date as well as an associated token. This information is stored by us so that you and we can identify your stored card and use it for further payments at MOO. This stored information can be deleted via the payment form on the Website should you wish to do so. We also store separately the last 4 digits and card type so that we can identify transactions made by a particular card. 

For PayPal we only store the tokens required to identify the transaction with PayPal, issue refunds and identify transactions made using PayPal.

**SPECIAL NOTIFICATION FOR EUROPEAN UNION RESIDENTS**

**DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION**

We may disclose information about our customers and visitors to the Website to third parties.

We may disclose Personal Information that we collect about you to these companies to enable them to perform these services. By way of example, information relating to your order which we have combined with other Personal Information (as explained above) may be shared with our third party service providers that assist us with our marketing efforts.   
Third Party Partners: We may partner with third parties to provide you with information about products or services that we feel may be of interest to you. We will only disclose your Personal Information to such third parties if you have consented to receiving such information. 

Law Enforcement, Protection of MOO and our Customers: We may also disclose Personal Information in other circumstances as required by law. We also reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information when we believe such disclosure is appropriate to cooperate with an investigation of activities claimed to be unlawful, to enforce our Terms of Use, or to protect the rights or property of MOO or others. (So, be good.) 

Merger, Sale or Acquisition: In addition, it is possible that in the future another company may acquire MOO or its assets or that MOO may partner with or purchase another company to continue to do business as a combined entity. In the event that any such transaction occurs, it is possible that our customer information, including your Personal Information, may be transferred to the new business entity as one of MOO’s assets. In such an event, we will update this policy to reflect any change in ownership or control of your Personal Information.

**YOUR CHOICES**

Communications from MOO: If you do not want to receive email communications from MOO about our own or third-party products and services that may be of interest to you, you can update your preferences in the My Account section of the Website (Don’t call and tell us though, we hate goodbyes).

We may still contact you via mail or phone, unless you request to be added to our Do-Not-Call list, and/or our Do-Not-Mail list by contacting us using the below details and indicating your preferences. Please be sure to provide your exact name, e-mail address, mailing address and telephone number(s) and the list or lists you would like to be included on (Do-Not-Call, and/or Do-Not-Mail). Even if you opt-out of email marketing or choose to be placed on one of these lists, we may still communicate with you using any of these methods for those non-marketing purposes set out above in the ‘Use of Information’ section. 

Deactivation of Your Account: You may also request deactivation of your MOO account (it makes us sad even seeing it written down) by contacting us using the below details and requesting account deactivation. Please note that your Personal Information may remain in our archived records after your account has been deactivated, but we will not keep it for longer than necessary to fulfill the purposes listed above. 

**UPDATING AND ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

If you wish to change your name, e-mail address, password, and/or communication preferences after you have registered, you can access your account in the My Account section of the Website. You may also request these changes by contacting us using the below details (and why not? We love a personal call!). 

If you are a resident of the European Union, you also have the right to request access to and correction of Personal Information that we hold about you. This right of access and correction can be exercised in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you. 

**WEBSITE SECURITY**

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards reasonably necessary to ensure the protection of your Personal Information against loss, misuse, disclosure and alteration. For example, we use Transport Security Layer (TSL) technology to encrypt your credit card information when you purchase products through our Website. Basically, it takes a lot of effort to break into this fortress. 

When you establish an account at MOO, you choose a password to help protect your account information. A password is only as strong as you make it: you should select a unique password and keep it safe. You may change your password as often as you wish by going to My Account section of the Website. You are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. Our sign-in process is designed to help protect your privacy. If you have trouble signing in to our Website, please ensure that you are using your registered e-mail address and correct password. If you are using your registered e-mail address and correct password, and you continue to have trouble signing in to our Website, please contact us using the details below. 

Notwithstanding the above, unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your own risk. (Typical internet, right?). 

**CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

MOO may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting a revised Privacy Policy on our Website and changing the last modified date at the top of the Privacy Policy. If we make significant changes to the Privacy Policy, we will note the Privacy Policy has changed on the main page of the Website and/or contact you by email (so do stay on the edge of your seat at all times). We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently (and why wouldn’t you?).
