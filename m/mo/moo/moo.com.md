Information Sharing And Disclosure

Disclosure for legal reasons 

We reserve the right to communicate such of a User’s personal information as we hold to third parties which seek the disclosure of it, and which make a legally compliant request for its disclosure. 

Performance of our operations 

The service is necessary for the performance of our operations: mail delivery, hosting services, protecting us from fraud, and payment of your account. 

Changes in MOO Print Ltd’s business 

If the assets MOO Print Ltd use to operate its business are acquired by a third party, we may transfer personal data we then hold to that party. If MOO Print Ltd buys or sells subsidiaries or business units then in such transactions customer information is one of the transferred assets, but would remain subject to the commitments made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy or equivalent. 

Aggregate business analyses 

MOO Print Ltd also provides analyses of our customers in the aggregate to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. We do this so that we, along with our business partners, can understand you better, and so we can keep bringing you first-rate services. We may also disclose, on an anonymous basis, literal statements made by our customers. At no time, however, will we disclose personal information about specific customers. 

Linked websites are not under the control of MOO Print Ltd and we are not responsible for the conduct of companies linked to our website. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website we advise you to examine their terms and conditions of use. 

Controlling Your Personal Information 

Transfer of information 

Personal information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the United Kingdom or any other country in which MOO Print Ltd maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside your country. 

We will not supply your personal data to a third party for commercial exploitation unless explicitly authorised by you; so you can rest assured that we will not sell the your name, personal details or email addresses to any third party without express consent from you 

The only circumstances in which we will provide any of your personal data to a third party for non-commercial purposes are those contained in this Privacy Policy. 

Security And Prevention Against Loss, Misuse Or Alteration Of Information 

Information storage 

All information you provide to us is stored in the UK only on secure servers that are protected in secure facilities including firewall protection. 

MOO Print Ltd has implemented such technology and security features, as well as strict internal guidelines, to safeguard the privacy of your personal information from unauthorised access or improper use. We will continue to enhance security as new technology becomes available. 

For transmitting your personal information to us, we use a secure server with a 128-bit SSL certificate that encrypts all of your personal information. This encryption process ensures that the information you give us is protected against unauthorised use. 

While we make every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our system, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 

Your MOO Print Ltd account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. You can play an important role in keeping your personal information secure by maintaining the confidentiality of your password used on the MOO Print Ltd web site. We recommend that you change your password from time to time for additional security. Please advise us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security. 

Access authorisation is granted to key MOO Print Ltd staff only. Backups are run to prevent loss of information, and our Internet servers are housed in secure facilities. 

We have security measures in place to protect our customer database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains each Member’s responsibility: 

to protect against unauthorised access to your details;   
to ensure against use by anyone else of the MOO Print Ltd Service through the machine that the member uses while they are logged on to the MOO Print Ltd Service;   
to log off or exit from the MOO Print Ltd Service when not using it;   
and to keep his/her password secret 

Data Retention Period 

We will retain your personal data only as long as is necessary for the purposes to which you consent under the MOO Print Ltd Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy, or as is required by applicable law, and then we will delete it 

Advertising 

Companies and individuals registered in the MOO Print Ltd Affiliate Program receive aggregate information about customers that they direct to MOO Print Ltd through links on their web site. No personally identifiable information is provided to affiliate members; the information collected from our affiliates is used strictly for the affiliates program and will not be used for general marketing purposes. 

The MOO Print Ltd Service may include interactive advertising for other businesses. We may use, and provide to third parties, anonymous demographic data provided by Members to target this advertising more appropriately 

Credit Card information 

There has been a lot of publicity about Credit Card security on the Internet so we decided to use Secure Hosting, who operate a secure server, to process our credit card payments. They encrypt Members’ credit or debit card information and authorise payment directly. This means that Members’ credit card details are never revealed to us. Secure Hosting may transfer to, process and hold your credit card information in countries either within or outside the European Economic Area in connection with performing their duties. 

Place Of Processing 

The personal information held by us is held on and processed by computers situated in the United Kingdom
