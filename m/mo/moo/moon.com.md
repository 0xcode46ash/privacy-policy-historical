Avalon Travel (“Avalon”) operates several websites including moon.com. It is Avalon’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Avalon collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Avalon’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Avalon’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Avalon may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Avalon also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on moon.com. Avalon only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Avalon’s websites choose to interact with Avalon in ways that require Avalon to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Avalon gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we may run a contest or giveaway which asks visitors to provide a name and email address, and/or zip code. In each case, Avalon collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Avalon. Avalon does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Avalon discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Avalon’s behalf or to provide services available at Avalon’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Avalon’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Avalon will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Avalon discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Avalon believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Avalon, third parties or the public at large. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Avalon takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Avalon uses cookies to help Avalon identify and track visitors, their usage of Avalon’s website, and their website access preferences. Avalon visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Avalon’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Avalon’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Business Transfers

If Avalon, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Avalon goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Avalon may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Avalon and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

## Comments

Comments and other content submitted to our Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Avalon may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Avalon’s sole discretion. Avalon encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
