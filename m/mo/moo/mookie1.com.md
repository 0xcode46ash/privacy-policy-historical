# Media Innovation Group - Privacy Policy

Media Innovation Group, LLC   
**  Privacy Policy**

The Media Innovation Group, LLC is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering user confidence in the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing. We continually evaluate innovative ways to protect online user privacy while also offering our clients the ability to own and use information regarding their interactions with their customers. Our services and products currently include Zeus Advertising Platform and B3 ("[Services](http://www.themig.com/)”). For a full description of these Services, see our website at [www.themig.com](http://www.themig.com/)

The purpose of this privacy policy is to provide online users with clear and complete notice about the user information we may collect in connection with our Services and on our own website.

**The information in the next few sections below describes how we collect information in connection with the operation of our Services for our clients. For information on how we collect and use information that is collected directly from you on this website, please see the section entitled "Your Correspondence on this Website.”**

### Information We Collect Through our Services

**We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information.**  
We do not collect the online user's personally identifiable information ("PII") through our Services.  PII generally refers to information such as an individual's name, mailing address, phone number or e-mail address.

**Non-Personal Information Collected by our Services**  
Through the collection and use of non-personally identifiable information ("Non-PII"), we offer a range of Services to allow advertisers to show you the most useful and relevant online advertisements. You can learn more about these advertising practices by visiting [www.iab.net/privacymatters](http://www.iab.net/privacymatters).

We may collect Non-PII regarding your online behavior and usage patterns through advertisements operated by our clients to better customize the type of advertisements you see on various sites.  Non-PII consists of aggregated information, demographic information (i.e. the country from which you are connecting to the internet) and other information such as the type of Internet browser used by an online user, a user's computer's Internet protocol ("IP”) address, the type of computer operating system used, the domain name of the websites visited before and after viewing an advertisement, as well as information related to websites and web pages a user is viewing when an advertisement is shown which does not specifically reveal a user's identity. 

We collect Non-PII through the use of cookies, pixels and related technology. No PII is collected or used in this process. A cookie is a file on your browser that uniquely identifies your browser and computer. A pixel is a line of code which is used by a website or third party ad server to track a user's activity.  The use of a pixel allows us to record that a user has visited a particular webpage and to collect additional Non-PII that an advertiser may choose to request through the pixel. We may use cookies and pixels for planning, serving, analyzing and managing online marketing and advertising campaigns on behalf of our clients. Non-PII that is collected through our pixels, cookies and related technology will be retained for up to fourteen (14) months, at which time it will be purged from our system.

_Sensitive Information_

We do not knowingly collect or utilize sensitive information. Sensitive information may include information such as confidential or medical information, religious beliefs and other similar or related information.

**Disclosure of Information to Third Parties** ****

We do not collect PII via our technology and our client�s advertisements.� We do not sell, rent, or share PII collected on through our Services with non-affiliated third parties. 

We may disclose Non-PII collected through our Services, and information derived from it, to our clients. This Non-PII may be used to deliver tailored ads to users on participating websites and for other purposes as described above. This information does not include any PII that can be used to contact or identify any person individually. Further, we encourage our clients, as applicable, to use any Non-PII they receive in compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing online privacy and encourage them to publish privacy policies that tell you about how the information they are gathering is being used. We urge you to always read the privacy policies of the websites you visit to understand issues relating to your online privacy.

We may disclose a user's information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. In addition, we may also disclose and provide access to a user's Non-PII to our vendors and contractors who are performing services on our behalf. However, such vendors and contractors are not permitted to use such user information for any purpose other than providing services to us.

### Information Security

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect against the unauthorized access to, retention of, and disclosure of data.  This includes undertaking necessary physical, electronic, and management activities required to protect data integrity, access, and use.  Any data that is stored on our servers is treated as confidential information.  Please keep in mind, however, that despite these reasonable efforts to protect data on our servers, no method of transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your data at all times, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and shall not be liable for any breach of security by an outside party.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

### Children's Privacy

We are sensitive to the issue of children's privacy.  Therefore, our website and Services are neither developed for, nor directed at, children.  If you believe your child has provided us with PII, and you would like to have the data removed, please contact us at [privacy@themig.com](mailto:privacy@themig.com).

### Linking to Other Websites

A link from our own website to another website does not imply our endorsement of that website. We do not control the websites to which we link and assume no responsibility for their content or privacy policies. Therefore, you should carefully review the privacy policies that apply to any websites you access from our website. 

### Transfer of Data upon Change of Control

In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of the assets of our business through a consolidation, merger, asset purchase, or other transaction, we reserve the right to transfer all data (including any PII a user may have provided through the “contact us” page) that is in our possession or under our control to such acquiring party.
