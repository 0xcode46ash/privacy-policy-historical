In order to ensure your privacy, information Moosejaw collects through the Moosejaw.com web site at www.moosejaw.com ("Site") is used only in the manner and for the purposes described in this Moosejaw.com Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy.")

**User Consent to Privacy Policy**  
Any person accessing, browsing, or otherwise using the Site, either manually or via an automated device or program, shall be considered a "User." All Users are bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. Users consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable User information ("Information") pursuant to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collected from Users**  
Moosejaw collects the email address of Users that email a question or comment to Moosejaw or submit a customer review. 

Moosejaw collects the billing and shipping addresses, including relevant e-mail, phone and credit card numbers and expiration dates of Users who purchase a product from Moosejaw through the Site. This includes Users who register to become Moosejaw members and those Users who enter any Moosejaw contests or other promotional features available on the Site. 

Through the use of "cookies" (for more information regarding cookies, see below), Moosejaw may collect and store anonymous information relating to Users' browsing patterns, including, for instance, the User's browser version, site referral information, IP address, operating system, and other technical Site use information.

**Cookies**  
The Site uses a feature of Internet Web browsers called a "cookie", which is a file that a User's Web browser places on a User's computer's hard drive, to assign an identification code to the computer and to collect anonymous browsing information. On this Site, cookies are used in conjunction with session variables to track a User's shopping cart and expire as soon as an order is completed or if a shopping cart sits idle for a lengthy period without being checked-out. 

Moosejaw does not use cookies to retrieve Information about Users from a User's computer unless the User knowingly and willingly provided such Information. For instance, Moosejaw's cookies do not collect any Information and the cookies do not collect, store or contain any credit card information. 

You may set your Internet Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being sent. If you prevent a cookie from being sent, you may limit the functionality Moosejaw can provide you when you visit the Site, especially when purchasing an item on the Site.

**"Do Not Track" Requests**  
Some web browsers send "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services. In compliance with Section 22575 of the California Business and Professions Code, we disclose to you that our system will stop tracking upon receipt of such "do not track" signals.

**Use of Information**  
Moosejaw uses the Information collected from its Users to:  
Respond to Users' questions or comments;  
Administer a User's contest entry or entry in other promotional feature;  
Fulfill a User's purchase request and notify Users of their order status;  
Provide Users with important functionality changes to the Site, new Moosejaw.com services and special offers from Moosejaw and reputable third parties that we think you will find valuable; and Mail a Moosejaw or third party catalog to you.

**Updating or Deleting User Information**  
Moosejaw offers Users who have provided Information to Moosejaw an opportunity to review the Information provided to update or correct any errors. Users also can delete any Information provided to Moosejaw or make choices about whether to receive special offers from Moosejaw or any of our friends. To update or delete Information previously provided or to have your name removed from any mailing lists or other promotional distribution lists, go to [Moosejaw.com](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/home____), sign into your account, and edit your profile. You can also email us at [privacy@moosejaw.com](mailto:privacy@moosejaw.com) and we will take care of your request for you.

**Disclosure of Information to Third Parties**  
Moosejaw may disclose information about our Users to others if we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Moosejaw or others. Moosejaw may disclose Information to a third party in the event that another company acquires Moosejaw or part of its assets. 

From time to time, Moosejaw may share your Information with other companies in order to provide you with a special offer or promotion that we think you will find valuable. Unless you specifically tell us that you do not want to receive these special offers (we can't imagine why), we may share your Information.

**Option to Limit Sharing with Third Parties**  
Moosejaw understands that Users do not want spam or junk mail from wicker furniture companies or Viagra marketers. We only share your Information with reputable companies who provide products or services that we believe interest our customers. Because we love you, and respect you, all Users always can choose whether or not their Information is shared with other companies, and all Users can change their minds at any time. In order to make a choice, do the following: 

If you have an account with Moosejaw, simply sign into your account at the Site and edit your profile. If you do not have an account with Moosejaw and do not want your Information shared with any third parties, send an e-mail to [privacy@moosejaw.com](mailto:privacy@moosejaw.com) or call Moosejaw at 877.666.7352. 

If you would like to stop the sharing of anonymous user data for advertising with third parties, click [HERE](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) to access the opt out page for the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI).

**Linked Internet Web Sites**  
The Site may provide hyperlinks, which are highlighted words or pictures within a hypertext document that, when clicked, take you to another place within the document, to another document altogether, or may take you to a third party website not controlled by Moosejaw. These hyperlinked third party websites may collect and disclose Information different than this Site. Moosejaw is not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of information collected through other web sites, and Moosejaw expressly disclaims any and all liability related to such collection, use, or disclosure.

**Children**  
The [Moosejaw.com](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/home____) Site is not directed towards children under 13 years of age and Moosejaw does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age through the Site.

**Security**  
Because we love you, this Site has security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Information under our control, including credit card information that is submitted to Moosejaw. When Users place orders or access their account information, the Site uses secure server software (SSL), which encrypts all information Users' input before it is sent to us. In addition, we do not store User's credit card numbers in their online accounts so if someone obtains a User's account log in information, they will not be able to view a User's credit card number. Thus, we have taken steps to protect the Information we collect from you from unauthorized access. Unfortunately, no system is perfect; therefore, Moosejaw makes no representations or warranties with regard to the sufficiency of these security measures. Moosejaw shall not be responsible for any actual or consequential damages that result from a lapse in compliance with this Privacy Policy because of a security breach or technical malfunction.

**Sale or Acquisition**  
In the event that another company acquires Moosejaw or all or part of its assets, we might do a jig. Also, we reserve the right to include Information among the assets transferred to the acquiring company.

**Applicable Law/International Issues**  
Information that is submitted to this Site will be collected, processed, stored, disclosed and disposed of in accordance with applicable U.S. law. If you are a non-U.S. User, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your Information, as discussed above, outside your resident jurisdiction. In addition, such Information may be stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction. U.S. law may not provide the degree of protection for Information that is available in other countries. By providing us with your Information, you acknowledge that you have read this Privacy Policy, understand it, agree to its terms and consent to the transfer of such Information outside your resident jurisdiction. If you do not consent to the terms of this Policy, please do not use this Site, but if you have already provided us with Information, please contact us at [privacy@moosejaw.com](mailto:privacy@moosejaw.com) and let us know how you would like us to handle such information.
