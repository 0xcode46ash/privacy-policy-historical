During the course of operating this web site, MoonDogSports.com does drop cookies, small text files, onto your hard drive. This is to allow us to recognize you as a subscriber or user and allows us to compile statistical data pertaining to the site’s usage.

However, we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on us; (2) protect and defend our rights or property; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone’s safety.

We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and maintenance of registration information in a separate database.

By using the Web Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
