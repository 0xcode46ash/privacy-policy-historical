# MODELS.com - Privacy Statement

_**MODELS.com and the Privacy of Visitors and Members**_

**Internet user privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost importance to MODELS.com.** Our reputation and integrity is directly related to how we serve our Web site's users and members.   
Please find below a description of how MODELS.com strives to protect your privacy.

_**User Information**_

To protect your privacy, MODELS.com: 

> 1\. Provides a privacy notice and/or a link to this Privacy Statement on all pages that ask for personal information; 
> 
> 2\. Will never release personal identifying information about you to any third party; and 
> 
> 3\. Will not knowingly collect or use personal identifying information from children younger than 13 without parental consent. 
> 
> **BUT please note** that MODELS.com may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) MODELS.com's rights or property, other MODELS.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. MODELS.com may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 

All users accessing the MODELS.com Web site, and viewing advertisements on MODELS.com's Web pages, retain complete anonymity where MODELS.com is concerned. As ads are delivered, MODELS.com does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private properties. MODELS.com does, however, collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet. MODELS.com servers note details such as the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of MODELS.com advertising clients and customers. 

There are instances where a user may provide specific personal information in response to an ad containing a survey, purchase agreement, or registration questionnaire. For such programs, MODELS.com (or a third party working in conjunction with MODELS.com and the advertiser) acquires this information on behalf of the client. This information is used by the client so the user can receive the goods or services requested. When requested, MODELS.com may employ this information in a compiled format to provide to the client a precise profile of the type of individuals responding to the ads. 

_**The Cookie Principle**_

MODELS.com may use cookies to improve your Web browsing experience. When you first access a MODELS.com Web page with or without an ad on it, MODELS.com or its advertising client may assign a unique random number to your computer browser - commonly known as a "cookie." We do this to measure the popularity of the different sections of the site, and to understand the way a user responds to the ads we deliver. For example, this number lets us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute or which articles on the site are more popular. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over and can also help us improve the MODELS.com Web site content and features based on users's actual usage of the site - thus enhancing your online Web viewing experience. 

_**3rd Party Measurement Services**_

Often, advertisers will employ a third-party measurement service other than MODELS.com for tracking the performance of an ad program. In these instances, MODELS.com has no control over the information collected by the third party, and may not be held responsible for the actions of the third party measurement service where collected information is concerned. If you have questions regarding different third party measurement services and their respective methods of information collection, please contact [feedback@models.com](mailto:feedback@models.com). 

_**Disclosure**_

MODELS.com openly volunteers its practices of collecting information, its targeting capabilities, and its use of cookies. If you have any questions pertaining to this privacy policy and its contents, please direct your correspondence to [feedback@models.com](mailto:feedback@models.com). 

MODELS.com reserves the right to amend this Privacy Statement at any time without notice, and only the current Privacy Statement may be deemed effective.
