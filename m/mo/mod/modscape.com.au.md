# Privacy Policy -

Modscape Pty Ltd (“Modscape”) is committed to upholding the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012. We recognise the importance of privacy and community awareness regarding the collection, use, disclosure and security of personal and sensitive information which we may collect during the course of our functions.  This Privacy Policy sets out how we manage your personal and sensitive information and protect your privacy.

**1.  What information we collect and hold**

Modscape provides design and construction services across Australia.  We will only collect personal and sensitive information that is necessary for us to provide these services.  The type of information we may collect and hold varies depending on the purpose for which it is collected (as set out at paragraph 3 below).

**2.  How we collect and keep safe your personal and sensitive information**

How we collect and store personal and sensitive information varies depending on the purpose for which it is collected but may include the collecting of copies of your:

  * written correspondence with us; or
  * request for assistance and/or other associated documents and information that you may provide to us in relation to this request.



We may keep copies of the above documents (in physical or electronic form at our election) as is necessary to provide our services.  All personal and sensitive information is securely stored at all times by us or an authorised external service provider and only authorised people will have access to the above documents and information.

**3.  Why we collect and hold personal and sensitive information**

We may collect, hold, use and disclose personal and sensitive information for purposes necessary to carry out our services.  Generally, these purposes include:

  * to keep in contact with you and inform you of our work;
  * to provide you with the services requested by you from us; or
  * to comply with our reporting obligations to the Australian Taxation Office and other government agencies and public sector bodies.[S1]



We are committed to maintaining your privacy and we will only use your personal and sensitive information for a permitted purpose for which we have collected the information.

You have the option of not identifying yourself or using a pseudonym when dealing with us, unless we believe it is impracticable to do so in the circumstances.  If you wish to deal with us in this manner, you must tell us in writing so that we can consider if your request is practicable.

**4.  How we may share your information**

If necessary to provide our services, we may need to disclose your personal and sensitive information to external service providers (such as information technology service providers, legal service providers, mailing houses etc.). These external service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personal and sensitive information for any purpose other than the purpose for which you have given us your personal and sensitive information. Otherwise, we will only share your personal and sensitive information in accordance with your express consent and instructions, as provided through the exclusions set out in the Australian Privacy Principles. We do not supply our database information to other marketing organisations not acting on our behalf.

**5.  How you can access and seek correction of your personal and sensitive information**

You have the right to access your personal and sensitive information, subject to some exceptions allowed by law.  If you would like to access or seek correction of your personal and sensitive information, please contact our Privacy Officer at the contact details below.  For security reasons you will be asked to put your request in writing.

To enable us to verify your request, we require you to advise the following:

  * your full name;
  * address;
  * contact phone number; and
  * the relevant department or service (if known) that your request relates to.



There is no application fee for making a request to access your personal and sensitive information.  While we do not normally charge for providing individuals with access to their personal and sensitive information, we reserve the right to charge you for our reasonable costs in complying with a request for access.  These costs will not be excessive.
