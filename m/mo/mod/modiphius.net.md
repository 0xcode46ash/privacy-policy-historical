**Your Privacy Choices**

You may [email us](http://eu-store.dice.se/feedback.aspx) to have your personal information removed from our database.

The remainder of this privacy policy sets out the way in which we will collect, store and use information about you. 

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**

When you log in, we need to know your name and e-mail address. This allows us to identify you as the person who used the Modiphius Entertainment service and to include the details in our database for order tracking. All information we hold about you is stored with the e-mail address you used when you registered for a promotion. When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. We may ask for other demographic information including age gender location and your preferences in relation to music and other Merchandising. This information is used to personalise our services to you and to create aggregate reports. The reports will not contain any personally identifying information. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the service. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the website, and new services that we may offer. If you would rather not receive this information you may opt out by clicking the opt-out link in the e-mail.

**How does Modiphius Entertainment protect customer information?**

Whenever you provide your details we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, as required by the UK Data Protection Legislation, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information that you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.

**What about "cookies"?**

Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Our cookies enable us to provide features such as making it easier to recall your profile details from our secure databases. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features in our service, including amending your Profile.

**Will Modiphius disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**

Modiphius Entertaiment may provide aggregate statistics about the users of the Modiphius Entertainment webstore, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mails, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing customer services. Such companies and individuals will have access to personal information needed to perform these functions, but may not use it for any other purposes and are required to process the data in accordance with the UK’s Data Protection legislation.

**In summary**

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect on the site to make your visit at Modiphius Entertainment as useful as possible and to enhance your overall experience, and to pass to our clients as requested. We will not sell trade or rent your personal information to others, except in the event of a major capital restructuring of Modiphius Entertainment Ltd such as a change of ownership.
