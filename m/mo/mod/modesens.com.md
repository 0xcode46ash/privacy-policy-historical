# ModeSens Privacy Policy

ModeSens Inc. (“ModeSens”) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. This notice describes ModeSens’s privacy policy for our web site (the “Site”) including all online services and functions associated with the Site (the “Services”).

You must register on this Site in order to use certain of the Site’s online services and functions, such as our blogs. If you just want to browse the Site, registration is optional.

During registration, you will be required to provide contact information, consisting of an email address and password.

You can select any username you want, except that your username cannot be an impersonation, the same or confusingly similar to a famous trademark, or be a term that is offensive in any way. You may, but are not obligated to, use your own name. If you do use your own name, you consent to it being passed to others by use of the functions of the Site. ModeSens reserves the right to reject or remove any username that does not meet applicable standards.

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. ModeSens use cookies on the Site.

ModeSens uses both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” ModeSens uses session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. If you check “remember me on this computer” when logging in to the Site, ModeSens also sets a persistent cookie to store your username passwords, so you do not have to enter it more than once. The persistent cookie also enables ModeSens to track and target the interests of users to enhance the experience on the Site. The persistent cookie is removed when you uncheck the “remember my email address” check box.

Your web browser allows you to control and limit cookies on your computer. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some areas or functions of the Site may be limited.

Some of ModeSens’s business partners (such as advertisers) use cookies on the Site. ModeSens has no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by ModeSens only and does not cover the use of cookies by any ModeSens’s business partners.

ModeSens may use social plugins on the Services, for instance plugins of the social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest and Tumblr, and may feature icons, like the “thumbs up” icon or text like “Recommend”, “Like” or “Comment”. Your browser may create a connection to the servers of such social networks and/or transmit data to such servers when you view a page on the Site. If you use the plugin functionality (e.g. click the “Like” button or make a comment), this information is also transmitted directly to the social network by your browser and may be stored there. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of these third party social networks.

ModeSens may use your username and email address to provide you with email newsletters and announcements. By signing up with an account on ModeSens, you would agree on receiving emails from ModeSens. If you do not wish to receive these kinds of communications, you can unsubscribe using the unsubscribe link provided in email. ModeSens also offers you the option to unsubscribe from newsletters and announcements by return email or by changing your profile on the Customer Profile page on the Site. 

The email address information that you provide on the Site may be used to contact you about other product and service offers from ModeSens. ModeSens may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services from other companies that you might be interested in. If you do not wish to receive these kinds of communications, you can opt out by unchecking the appropriate email offer announcements boxes during registration. In addition, you can choose not to receive such information by opting-out on the Customer Profile page on the Site.

ModeSens may also use your registered name and email address to provide you with significant announcements about Site functions or Services that you are registered to use, about this Site, about any user account you may create, about fulfillment of a specific transaction you have requested, or about other significant developments that may affect your use of the Site. You cannot opt-out of this kind of email.

This Site may request additional information from you on product order forms or other online transaction forms. Such forms may require you to provide contact information (such as name and mailing or shipping address) and payment information (such as credit card number and credit card expiration date). Information that you provide in this way may be used for billing and accounting purposes, for recording products and services that you have licensed, bought or downloaded, and to fill your orders. ModeSens may use this contact information to communicate about orders, products, services, or fees or charges.

ModeSens may use an outside shipping company to ship orders and uses a credit card processing company to process payments for goods and services. These companies have access to user information in order to perform their functions.

ModeSens may partner with other third parties to provide specific goods or services. When you sign up for such goods or services, ModeSens will share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these goods or services. ModeSens does not authorize third party providers to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose related to these goods or services.

ModeSens may share your information in other circumstances with your consent, for example when you have chosen to link an account with the Services with a social media network like Facebook.

The Site may allow you to contribute to one or more blogs or communicate by means of online functions.

Nothing requires you to disclose your identity to others. If you choose to disclose your identity to third parties using any Site function or service, you do so at your own risk. ModeSens is not responsible for the privacy or security of any information, personal or otherwise, that you may choose to communicate or exchange using the functionality of the Site.

Each item of information or any materials you contribute for such purposes are your “Public Content.” Public Content must be content and information that you have a right to disclose and transfer and must not violate any other person’s privacy or intellectual property rights.

ModeSens has feedback functionality on the Site that allows you to submit comments, suggestions, or bugs found. ModeSens may collect your name or username and email address in order to follow up with you or thank you for a suggestion.

ModeSens may track the Site to analyze trends, administer the Site, track your actions and use of the Site, record transactions, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. Such analysis is not linked to personally identifiable information such as names and email addresses.

ModeSens may share aggregated demographic and usage information with its partners and advertisers. This aggregated information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person, such as names and email addresses.

This Site may contain links to other sites. ModeSens is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. ModeSens encourages users to be aware when they leave the Site and to read the privacy statements of sites that collect personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies only to information collected on this Site.

Personal information you provided on ModeSens will be private and will not be visible to others. Closet informaiton including product likes, wants, and pictures shared by default is accessable to public. By providing this information on ModeSens, you agree ModeSens to use your closet inforamtion for promotion inside or outside ModeSens. If you do not wish to share closet information to public or any other party, you can set your closet as private in profile setting.

If you provide personally identifiable information changes (such as an email address or zip code), ModeSens will make reasonable effort to provide a way to correct, update or remove your personal data. 

Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to register on this Site or use any functionality for which registration is required.

ModeSens may be sold, might sell or buy businesses or assets of businesses, or ModeSens might merge with another business. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that ModeSens, a line of business of ModeSens, or substantially all the assets of ModeSens are transferred, customer information may well be one of the transferred assets. ModeSens will make reasonable effort to provide notice on the Site and to notify you via email to the most recent email address that you have provided to ModeSens of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

ModeSens may release information concerning your use of ModeSens (including, but not limited to, posted Public Content, registration information, and network records) when it believes in good faith that such release is appropriate to comply with the law (for example, pursuant to a statutory demand, subpoena, warrant or court order), to protect against fraudulent, abusive or unlawful use of the ModeSens, to protect ModeSens's rights or property, enforce any contract between you and ModeSens, or if ModeSens reasonably believes that a situation involving danger of death or injury to any person requires disclosure.

ModeSens does not intend to sell, share, or rent information obtained on this Site other than as discussed in this privacy policy.

If ModeSens decides to change its privacy policy, ModeSens will post those changes on ModeSens’s Site so ModeSens’s users can remain aware of what information ModeSens collects, how ModeSens uses it, and under what circumstances, if any, ModeSens discloses it.

Residents of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the Company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes and a disclosure of the shared information. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that provides you with an “opt-out” choice for use of your personal information by third parties for marketing purposes, the Company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.

This Site qualifies for the alternative option. Its privacy policy provides you with information on how you may opt-out from the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information during the preceding year for marketing purposes.

If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, send a request to the following email address: [info@modesens.com](https://web.archive.org/%22mailto:info@modesens.com/%22).
