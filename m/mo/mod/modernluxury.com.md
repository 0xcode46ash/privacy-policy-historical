Modern Luxury Media Online Privacy Policy

At Modern Luxury Media, we realize your privacy is important. This policy addresses the information collected and how we use that information when you register for a newsletter (such as The Modern Luxury Hot List) and/or visit our Web site. Any changes to the policy will be posted here. If you have any questions or concerns about our policy or its implementation, you may contact us at this email address: [OnlinePrivacy@modernluxury.com](mailto:OnlinePrivacy@modernluxury.com)

**Children’s Privacy**  
Modern Luxury Media online products are not intended for children under the age of 13.

Information We Collect and How We Use It

**Personal Information**  
During sign-up for a newsletter, we ask you for your email address so that we may send you the newsletter. We will also ask for your zip code. Modern Luxury may share this information so that we may deliver you the products you have requested, such as the Hot List. In addition, we may share this information as required by law or a court order. Modern Luxury Media will never sell, share, or rent your personal information for marketing purposes without your express permission.

**Non-Personal Information**  
We will also ask you for non-personally identifiable demographic information—including, but not limited to, your gender, your income and age range, and your interests—so that we may better provide you with content and services best suited to you. 

**Usage Information**  
Modern Luxury Media may also collect information about site or product usage that we use for the purposes of designing, modifying, or improving our products and services. If this information is shared, such as with advertisers, it is only done so in the aggregate and in an anonymous form; it is not linked to your personally identifiable information.

**Tracking Information**  
The Modern Luxury Media Web server automatically collects limited information about your computer configuration, such as your IP address, or your operating system. Modern Luxury may also use “cookies” to track usage on the Modern Luxury web sites so that we may tailor content and services to you. (A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server. It is stored on your computer’s hard drive). If you choose not to accept cookies, you may not be able to see all of the features and functionality of the site. In addition, Modern Luxury Media advertising and marketing partners may use their own cookies.

  
**Your Choices**  
We offer you choices when we ask for personally identifiable information, whenever reasonably possible. You can also modify your settings for newsletter products, [here](https://web.archive.org/signup/profile). We will also make a good faith effort to provide you with access to your personally identifiable information upon request, and let you correct such data if it is inaccurate.

**Links to Other Sites**  
Throughout Modern Luxury Media’s online services, we may link to other sites. Modern Luxury Media is not responsible for, nor do we endorse, the content that appears on those sites. Please check the privacy policies of all the sites you frequent to determine how user information is collected and used.

**Security**  
Modern Luxury Media has taken the appropriate steps to protect the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information.
