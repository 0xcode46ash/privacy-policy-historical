# Privacy Policy - MoDaCo

**Privacy Statement**

_1\. Visitor Notice_

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (Personal Information) or allows us to contact you. Generally this information is requested when you are asked to register before participating on the forums, entering a contest, or ordering e-mail newsletters. We use your Personal Information for four primary purposes:

  * To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.
  * To help you quickly find services or information on MoDaCo.
  * To help us create content most relevant to you.
  * To alert you to special offers, updated information and other new services from MoDaCo.



 _2\. Visitor Consent_

If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of the features on MoDaCo, but you will not be able to access areas that require registration. MoDaCo may offer newsletters, which are sent only to opt-in lists. They also include a very easy and simple way to be removed once you have joined.

_3\. Financial Information_

MoDaCo does not retain any of your financial information used to make purchases in the MoDaCo store.
