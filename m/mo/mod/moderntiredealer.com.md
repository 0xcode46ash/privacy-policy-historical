#### Collected Information

The information we collect is gathered from several sources. These include our conferences, product subscription forms/registrations, reader service cards, website message postings, survey information and purchases via telephone, direct mail, email, and other electronic sources. From these sources we may collect postal addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and/or demographic information for those individuals that volunteer such information. For each visitor to our websites, our web server automatically recognizes the visitor’s domain name and IP address in addition to information on what web pages visitors’ access or visit.

We use Google Analytics remarketing, display network reporting, and analytics demographics and interest reporting. Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for display advertising and customize Google display network ads using the [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads "Google Ad Settings"). You may also opt-out of additional data collection via the Google Analytics [opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ "Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on"). We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone’s past visits to your website.

#### How We Use Collected Information

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web pages, to customize the content and layout of our pages for each individual visitor, and/or to notify visitors about updates to our website. As part of a subscription and/or registration agreement, subscribers and registrants will be contacted by us through mail, e-mail, and/or phone to communicate with them about their subscription and/or registration. They will be contacted for renewal, re-qualification, surveys, updates concerning their account profile and special offers related to their subscription and/or registration. We also use the information to contact them for marketing purposes and share this information with other reputable organizations to allow them to contact our subscribers and registrants. We never share individual contact information about our members with advertisers or third party vendors unless otherwise specified when the information is collected. Certain promotions or events (White Papers, Expo Registration, etc.) may necessitate the sharing of Personally Identifiable Information with reputable 3rd Party vendors.  We will always notify you at time of registration when these instances occur.  Certain information — such as your password and credit card number — is never disclosed in any form whatsoever to any outside party.

#### Email Communications

If you have registered for our products and/or services, and have supplied an e-mail address, you will receive emails pertaining to your subscription and/or registration. These are sent in order to maintain your account with Bobit Business Media.

For marketing e-mails, we retain three types of usage permission for submitted e-mail addresses as defined below.
