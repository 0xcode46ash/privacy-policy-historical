# Momentive.com - Momentive Specialty Chemicals Privacy Policy

Revised August 31, 2014

This Privacy Policy describes the information collection, use, and disclosure practices of the Momentive Performance Materials Inc. (“Momentive”) website, hosted at [www.momentive.com](http://www.momentive.com/ "www.momentive.com") (the “Site”).

From time to time, Momentive may make changes to this Privacy Policy.  Any future modifications to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the Site, with an updated “Revised” date at the top.  Your continued use of the Site after any changes have been posted constitutes your agreement to those changes.

## INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

**Personal Information**  
You may browse most areas of the Site without providing any personal information to Momentive. To access some services or areas on the Site, you may be asked to register, and you may also be asked to provide information about you and/or your company such as name, job title, email address, and other information.  This information will enable Momentive to provide services and/or information to you. If you order products or use certain services available through this Site, you may be asked to provide further information, including, but not limited to, billing information (such as credit card account information), product information, and other personal information. Momentive may also collect other information from you when you provide comments or participate in surveys. We use such personal information to provide our services and otherwise operate our business, consistent with this Privacy Policy and any notice that may be provided at the time of collection. In most cases, personal information is used only to respond to your inquiry or to process your request.

If you use the online job search program, you may be asked to provide additional information about yourself as part of the application process, such as your address and other contact information, your educational history, or your work history.  The members of our Human Resources staff will review and process your application, and the information you provide may become part of your personnel file if you accept a job at Momentive. Even if you do not accept a job, the information you provide may also be kept on file for purposes of identifying future employment opportunities for you at Momentive.

 **Other Information**  
Momentive’s web servers may collect certain non-personal information, including the name of the domain you used to access the Internet and the web site you came from and visit next. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics about visitors to this Site.

 When registering with this Site, certain technical and routing information about your computer is collected to facilitate your use of the Site. For example, environmental variables are logged, such as browser type, operating system and CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of your originating Internet Service Provider. Momentive also records search requests and results to try to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the search engine. Your IP address is also used to track your use of the Site. This "clickstream" data may be matched with the registration data you provide, in which case we will treat it as personal information.

To gather general statistics, our servers may place a "cookie" (a small data file typically made up of a string of text and numbers, which assigns the visitor a unique identifier) on your computer or use other, similar technologies to recognize your computer. Furthermore, Momentive maintains a "server cookie" on its own system in order to recognize a returning visitor, and to track statistical information about the visitor’s navigation to and throughout certain areas of this Site, as well as to Momentive promotions on other sites. This information allows better administration of the Site, and provides a more tailored and user-friendly service to you. It is used for internal purposes, such as to improve Site navigation and to measure the effectiveness of our promotional placements. If you prefer not to accept cookies, you may be able to use features provided by your browser to reject them or to alert you before one is placed. However, rejection of a cookie may limit the functionality that is available to you when you visit this Site.

## SHARING OF INFORMATION

When you provide information to Momentive, it may be shared with third party service providers to perform business functions for us or on our behalf including, but not limited to, fulfilling your requests and offering you other Momentive products and services that may be of interest to you. Momentive does not share, sell, or lease personal information about you to any third parties for their own direct marketing use. Momentive may disclose information about you to other third parties if we believe that we have a legal obligation to do so or where we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.  In the event Momentive merges with another company, or another company acquires all or part of Momentive’s assets, including without limitation, in the event of bankruptcy, personal information compiled or owned by Momentive may be among the items transferred in that transaction. In addition, the information you provide may be shared with Momentive operating units or departments, as well as affiliates or other companies under common ownership with Momentive, whether located in the United States or in other parts of the world.

## DATA SECURITY

Momentive maintains reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized access. Access to information about you is restricted to those Momentive workers who need to know the information to respond to your inquiry or request. 

## LINKS

 This Site may feature links to other websites. Momentive is not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites. You should contact these companies directly if you have any questions about their collection or use of information about you.

## SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR OUR EUROPEAN USERS

In addition, such data may be stored on servers located in jurisdictions outside of the EU or EEA.
