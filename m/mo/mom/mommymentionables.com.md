# Disclosure & Privacy Policy

### Disclosure

This blog is a personal blog written and edited by me. This blog accepts forms of cash advertising, sponsorship, paid insertions or other forms of compensation.  This blog abides by word of mouth marketing standards. We believe in honesty of relationship, opinion and identity. The owner of this blog is compensated to provide opinion on products, services, events, websites and various other topics.  Even though the owner of this blog receives compensation for our posts or advertisements, we always give our honest opinions, findings, beliefs, or experiences on those topics or products.

Some reviews are done on my own accord and on products that I personally own.  Sponsored reviews are on products, services or events in which I have received complimentary for review.  That content or advertising space will be clearly identified as a paid or sponsored post. The views and opinions expressed on this blog are purely the bloggers’ own. Any product claim, statistic, quote or other representation about a product or service should be verified with the manufacturer, provider or party in question. This blog does not contain any content which might present a conflict of interest.

Affiliate links are used throughout this site. By purchasing a product through an affiliate link, your costs will be the same, but Mommy Mentionables will receive a small commission. This helps to cover some of the costs for the site.
