# ParentsClick Network

At ParentsClick Network, we are committed to maintaining your privacy and trust. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, protect, use, and share information about you, including on our website, and/or through your membership in ParentsClick Network. We hope this information increases your confidence in ParentsClick Network and enhances your experience on our website. Please see our separate [Terms of Service](http://www.parentsclick%20network/legal) which governs the use of the web site and services located at www.ParentsClick Network (the "Site").

### Information that We Collect

In this Privacy Policy, when we use the term "personally identifiable information", we mean any information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone number or email address. When we refer to "aggregate information", we mean information that does not allow us to identify a specific individual but describes a general category of visitors to the Site or particular attributes of such visitors, such as demographic information, usage of the Site and other anonymous information.

#### Personally Identifiable Information that We Collect.

You do not have to be a ParentsClick Network Member to visit our Site and access some of our content. However, as a non-Member visitor, you may not have access to some of the most popular features that ParentsClick Network offers. For example, only Members can leave comments, post on our message boards, blogs, and participate in other online activities. If you are not currently a ParentsClick Network Member, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/user/register) to register and become eligible for all of ParentsClick Network's features.

If you choose to become a ParentsClick Network Member, we will ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including your name, address and email address. We will also ask you to provide certain information about yourself and your family. This is a standard process to enhance the safety and maintain the integrity of the Site for all our members.

Non-Member visitors to the Site can register to receive ParentsClick Network newsletters by giving us your name, email address and giving your consent to receive the newsletters. However, you are not considered a full ParentsClick Network Member with all the privileges of membership until you complete the registration form and provide us with additional required Member information.

#### Aggregate Information that We Collect.

We may also collect certain aggregate information automatically when you visit our Site such as the browser you are using (i.e. Internet Explore 6.0, Mozilla Firefox 1.5, etc.), the internet address from which you linked to our Site, the operating system of your computer (i.e., Microsoft Windows), the unique IP address of the computer you used to access our Site and usage and browsing habits. We use this information to administer and improve your experience on our Site, to help diagnose and troubleshoot potential server malfunctions, and to gather broad demographic information.

To help make sure you receive information that is relevant to you, our Site uses data "cookies." These cookies are small data files stored on your computer which identify you as a previous visitor to the Site and help us to personalize your experience when you arrive. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. You can instruct your browser not to accept cookies. However, if you disable this function, you will not be able to use some of the features on our Site.

Our Web pages and our e-mail newsletters contain "web beacons." Web beacons allow us to count users that have visited a web page or opened an email that contains a web beacon and collect other types of aggregate information. Using this information, we are able to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our Site. This allows us to learn what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which parts of our Site are the most interesting and what kind of offers our Members like to see. Some of the web beacons that are in place on our Site are used only by ParentsClick Network, and other web beacons are from our vendors and advertisers who use this data to assist us in analyzing how our Members use the Site. In addition, we have agreements with various affiliate networks that promote ParentsClick Network on their affiliate websites. These affiliate advertisers may use web beacons in their advertisements to track users who click through from the affiliate website to the Site.
