# - Privacy Statement

MomsWhoThink.com respects your right to the privacy of the personal information you provide us on our web sites. To that end, unless you designate otherwise or we state otherwise in this policy or at the time information is collected, any personal information you provide to MomsWhoThink.com will be known only to two parties: you and MomsWhoThink.com. The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our site. Personal information includes your name, e-mail addresses, click-through activity and any other personal information you may provide here. 

**Use of MomsWhoThink.com cookies**

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies in a limited way to identify unique browsers that visit us and to track usage throughout our site. The information about readership and site usage that Moms Who Think collects through cookies is aggregated into general reports about readership and not tied to individual identities ever. Your e-mail address will not be shared with anyone and no one except Moms Who Think will be able to contact you. If you choose to allow other members to email you, they will not be able to view your email address. You will be sent an email through our email forwarding system. 

**"E-mail to a friend" feature**

MomsWhoThink.com offers an "e-mail a friend about this story" feature, allowing site visitors to send e-mail to friends to inform them about an article they might be interested in reading. In order for this feature to function, we ask for e-mail addresses for the recipient (so we know who to mail the message to) and from the sender (so we can tell the recipient who sent the e-mail). We do not store or save these addresses and you will not receive e-mail or other communications from Moms Who Think as a result of having used this feature. "E-mail a friend about this story" is a mail service that individual visitors to MomsWhoThink.com can make use of to send individual e-mails. While this tool cannot be used to send mass "spam" mailings, MomsWhoThink.com has no control over how our visitors use it, and any e-mail sent through it originates with, and is the responsibility of the sender, not MomsWhoThink.com 

**Other disclosure of personal information**

MomsWhoThink.com will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information without your consent except (i) as described in this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by law, court order or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority. This policy does not protect information you post to any public forum within our Web site. 

**Other sites**

MomsWhoThink.com contains many links to other sites on the Web. We cannot control and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other Web sites.
