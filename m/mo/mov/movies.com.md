In the event Buena Vista Online plans to post any such information on a site, guests are provided prior notification of such posting.

    * Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, movies.com does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever. 
    * Although children are allowed to participate in contests, children ages 16 and under must get their parent's or guardian's permission before entering any sweepstakes or contests.

Use of Cookies

What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes while at the site. Cookies make Web-surfing easier by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences for you. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and you'll find cookies at most major Web sites. 

Buena Vista Online does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is the information shared with any third parties whatsoever. Buena Vista Online does not use cookies to identify individuals or to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. 

Cookies help make movies.com better, by showing how and when guests use the site. They do not, however, track who uses the site. Many content improvements and updates are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. 

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. These cookies are sent from third-party computers and are subject to the above-stated policies. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, it is possible that some areas of the site will not function properly if you do so. 

Buena Vista Online reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying guests of the existence of a new privacy policy. You can send [e-mail](https://web.archive.org/web/19980125173023id_/http%3A//www.movies.com/Mail/index.html) to us with any further questions.
