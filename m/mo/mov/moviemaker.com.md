**MovieMaker Magazine Online Privacy Policy**

This document sets forth the MovieMaker Online Privacy Policy for this Web site, www.moviemaker.com (the "site"). If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use this site.

Please note that the Site contains links to other sites and occasionally allows other sites to be co-branded with the MovieMaker name. Web sites that are linked to the Moviemaker site or carry the Moviemaker name for co-branding or marketing purposes may have privacy policies which differ from that of MovieMaker.

The MovieMaker Magazine Online Privacy Policy discloses our privacy practices and contains detailed information about the following:

**Types of Information Collected**

MovieMaker collects **anonymous information** , which refers to data that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For example, MovieMaker collects some information each time a visitor comes to the site so we can improve the overall quality of the visitor's online experience. MovieMaker collects the visitor's IP address (e.g., whether the user is logged on from ibm.com or aol.com), referral data (e.g., the Internet address of the last Web page visited by a user), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). MovieMaker also collects aggregate search terms from its search services for internal reporting and targeted advertising.  In addition, MovieMaker collects your responses to online surveys displayed on the site; these anonymous and optional surveys will seek your opinions about MovieMaker. You do not have to register with the MovieMaker before we can collect this anonymous information. 

**Personally identifiable information** refers to data that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and postal address, which may be collected in addition to the anonymous data described above. MovieMaker collects personal information in the following ways:

> a.  HOP or Newsflash Registration: When you register to receive MovieMaker’s monthly Hands-on-Pages (“HOP”) or Newsflash, you must provide MovieMaker with your email address.  Other information, such as your name, postal address, ZIP Code, birth date, gender, telephone number, occupation, marital status is optional.
> 
> b.  MovieMaker Trivia: When you register for MovieMaker’s periodic trivia contests, you must provide MovieMaker with your email address. Any personally identifiable information necessary for the delivery of the user’s prize is utilized only for that purpose and discarded after successful delivery. However, if the contest prize involves a monthly or yearly subscription, thus necessitating periodic contact, the information is retained. 
> 
> c.  Online Readers Surveys:  When you register for MovieMaker’s periodic online readers surveys, you must provide MovieMaker with your email address.  Any personally identifiable information necessary for the delivery of the user’s prize is utilized only for that purpose and discarded after successful delivery. However, if the contest prize involves a monthly or yearly subscription, thus necessitating periodic contact, the information is retained. 
> 
> d. Purchases: When you purchase an item or a subscription through MovieMaker, you must provide MovieMaker with your name, billing address, billing city, billing state, billing zip, shipping address, shipping city, shipping state, shipping zip, telephone number, email address, and credit card information.  Credit card information is discarded after successful payment.  Personally identifiable information is retained for delivery and customer service purposes. 
> 
> e. Correspondence: If you contact MovieMaker, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We do not collect any email addresses of those who communicate with MovieMaker via email. We use the information provided so that we may respond to the email.

**Information Collection/Maintenance**

Information is generally collected and maintained solely by MovieMaker unless specifically stated otherwise at the point of collection. If data is collected and/or maintained by any company other than MovieMaker, we will tell you at the point of collection. If you do not want to share your information with that company, you can choose not to use that service.

MovieMaker runs many promotions and sweepstakes. These promotions may be sponsored or co-sponsored by third-party companies. Data collected during a promotion is typically shared with the sponsor or co-sponsor. MovieMaker will inform you at the point of collection whether or not we are sharing your personal data as a result of your participation in a promotion or sweepstakes. If you do not want to have the MovieMaker share your data, you can choose not to participate in the promotion or sweepstakes.

MovieMaker’s Online Privacy Policy does not cover third-party data collection practices and MovieMaker does not assume any responsibility for any actions of third parties.

**Information Usage**

**Any personally identifiable information you share with MovieMaker is maintained and accessible only by MovieMaker unless specifically stated otherwise.   **

MovieMaker collects anonymous data and shares it with third-party advertisers in an aggregate form. We will also disclose to advertisers the overall impressions/clicks for their advertisements. In addition, we may disclose anonymous results from online surveys to third-party advertisers. No personally identifiable information will be disclosed as part of this process.

MovieMaker also uses the aggregate data to perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors, to measure user interests regarding specific areas of the site, and to analyze how and where best to use our resources. We do not track what pages individual users are browsing, but rather how well each page performs overall. Without such data, we would not know which parts of the site are the most popular, and we would not be able to change and update the content and services appropriately.

**MovieMaker does not sell, rent, or lease its mailing list(s) to entities unknown to its members.**

**Opt-Out Policy for HOP/Newsflash subscribers**

MovieMaker newsletters have easy-to-follow unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.  Modifications are effective immediately.

**Security Procedures**

MovieMaker has security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control.  Only authorized employees have access to the information you provide us. Any particularly sensitive information, such as a credit card number for purchases is encrypted prior to transmission.  While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we take many precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.

**Updates**

MovieMaker will update this policy from time to time so please check back periodically. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will prominently post such changes prior to implementing them.
