We are so confident that your transactions on our secure server will always be safe that we guarantee your protection in the event of an unauthorized interception and use of your credit card.[Privacy](http://www.moviepostershop.com/#)

The information we need:  
When you place an order, we will ask for your contact information (i.e., name, shipping address, and e-mail address) and, if you are paying by credit card, financial information (like credit card number and expiration date.) We have partnered with a credit card processing company to assist us in processing your payment; however, that company does not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. The information you provide us is used for processing and fulfilling your order and contacting you if we have problems processing your order.  
Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law and when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process.  
What we do with your information: The private information that you give us when you place an order or utilize one of our special services is used to process and fulfill your order or request.
