# Privacy Policy

We appreciate your interest in our website and our company (hereafter Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts or we). We highly value your trust in us, and recognize both the significance and the obligation to treat your data with care, and protect that data from misuse or abuse. 

We take the protection of your private data very seriously, and strictly adhere to relevant data protection legislation. Personal data is collected on this website only to the extent necessary. In no case will the data be sold or made available to third parties without permission. This privacy statement will inform you how we handle your data. 

By using our website and the offers contained therein, you agree that the data you have provided may be stored, processed, or used by us within the scope of this privacy policy.

### Collection, processing, or use of Personal Data

Personal information is any information relating to an identified or identifiable person. Personal information about you is collected, processed, or used by us only when you provide it to us voluntarily or with consent, and where it is within the scope of the law.

As a point of principle, you can visit our website without telling us who you are. Every access to our website and every request for a file stored on our website are logged. This logging relates solely to information, which does not allow you to be identified. The following data are logged: Name of the requested file, date and time of the request, amount of data transferred, notification of successful request, web browser used, and requesting domain.  The logging serves internal system and statistical purposes and we analyse this data only in an anonymised or pseudonymised form. IP addresses of requesting computers are not collected by Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts.

The Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts website collects and stores data in an anonymised form for marketing and optimisation purposes for use with Analysetools (Google Inc. [www.google.com/analytics/de-DE/](http://www.google.com/analytics/de-DE/)). User profiles are created under a pseudonym from these data, and cookies may be used for this purpose. The data will not be used to identify visitors to this website and will not be aggregated with other information about the bearer of the pseudonym. You can, at any time, revoke consent to this processing of your data by our website. 

As a matter of practice, we will only collect such data as required for the provision of services, for example the answering your questions or the execution of contracts between us. For example, to book a room for you, we require your credit card details, card number, and CVV, which will be stored, encrypted on secure servers.  If we ask you for further data that is not mandatory, we will clearly mark such responses as voluntary.

### Will Personal Data be Made Available to Third Parties?

A transfer of your data to third parties will only occur within the scope of the implementation of the services requested by you, or in any other case, with your permission. Transfer of data related to your person to governmental entities or authorities will occur only where required by law. 

### Security

If you enter personal data like your name, address, or credit-card number, such information will be transferred in an encrypted manner. As soon as your data reaches Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts, it will be stored on a secured server. This prevents unauthorised access to the data. Our security procedures are continuously improved in line with current technological developments.

We reserve the right to work with providers who operate servers outside of the territory of the European Union. The company Sabre Hospitality Solutions, whose servers we currently use, adhere to the „Safe Harbour Principles“ and therefore guarantee the same level of protection for data saved on their servers that apply within the EU. 

### Deletion of Collected Data

Deletion of the collected data occurs when you revoke your agreement to the processing of such data, when the knowledge of your data will no longer be necessary for the fulfilment of the purpose that lead to the collection and processing of your data, or where the processing of your data is not permitted by law. 

### Social Networks

Our website hosts plug-ins from common social networks. If you use such a plug-in, a connection to the servers of the relevant social network will be established, and information about your visit to our website will be transferred. If you are logged in to said social network, this information can be related by the social network to your personal profile. Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts shall not be liable for the transfer and processing of your data by social networks. Please refer to the terms and policies of use of the relevant social networks.
