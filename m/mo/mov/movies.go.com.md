# Buena Vista Online Privacy Policy

  
BUENA VISTA ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY

The policies below are applicable to movies.com and other sites on the World Wide Web portion of the Internet owned and operated by Buena Vista Online. 

Buena Vista Online collects personally identifying information only during (i) contest or sweepstakes Registration, (ii) subscription Registration for sites that require subscription, and (iii) online shopping. In addition, Registration is required and information is collected in certain portions of sites in which guests provide content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities (i.e., community postings, voting, chat, games, or bulletin boards). Buena Vista Online may use such information to award prizes or track compliance with our House Rules, or for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when guests provide the information). In the event Buena Vista Online plans to post any such information on a site, guests are provided prior notification of such posting and given the option of preventing such posting. 

Policies for Individuals Under 13

  * Buena Vista Online encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites. 
  * No information should be submitted to or posted at Buena Vista Online's Web sites by guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. 
  * Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, Buena Vista Online does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever. 
  * All registrants receive e-mail confirming their Registration. In addition, when a guest under 13 registers, his/her parent or guardian receives an e-mail about Registration and providing instructions on how the parent or guardian can delete the Registration if so desired. 
  * Although guests under 13 years of age are allowed to participate in contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parents or guardians identified in the initial Registration process. 
  * No information collected from guests under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside Buena Vista Online. 
  * Guests' e-mail addresses are never posted on Buena Vista Online Web sites. 
  * To facilitate global registration within sites operated by Buena Vista Online and its GO Network affiliates all Registration information is shared. It is our goal to make your visits to our sites easy and enjoyable. 



Policies for Individuals 13 Years of Age or Older

With the permission of a guest who is 13 years of age or over, information submitted at the time of Registration or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Buena Vista Online and may be shared with our affiliates of GO Network or companies that have been prescreened by Buena Vista Online. If a guest objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use -- either by e-mail request or by modifying his/her Registration information online. When you register with Buena Vista Online, every effort will be made to maintain your information in a secure environment by Buena Vista Online and our affiliates at GO Network. 

If you wish to modify your Registration information or stop receiving e-mail updates from Buena Vista Online, just click the "Register" link at the lower left of any page on Buena Vista Online. Once you have entered your or your child's Registration Name and Password, click the "Update Registration" button. You can then modify your information or e-mail requests. When you click the "Update Registration" button, your request will be sent and a confirmation notice will appear.   


About IP Addresses

Buena Vista Online collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. 

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 

When guests request pages from Buena Vista Online sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. 

  
Use of Cookies -- The Buena Vista Online Cookies Policy

What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're at our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites. 

By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. If you accept the first tracking cookie from Buena Vista Online, you won't be offered as many afterward. 

Examples of How Buena Vista Online Sites Use Cookies

A cookie lets the computers remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. 

How Buena Vista Online Sites Do Not Use Cookies

Buena Vista Online sites never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as described below, Buena Vista Online sites do not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever. 

Buena Vista Online sites do not use cookies to identify specific individuals, except in such cases as contest registration (where a cookie allows you to enter a contest every day without registering again each time). 

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. Buena Vista Online does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to the Buena Vista Online cookie policy. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the contest and game areas, will not function properly if you do so. 

Links to Other Sites

Users should be aware that when they are on Buena Vista Online sites they could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from Buena Vista Online sites that take you outside our service. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, the click takes you off the Buena Vista Online site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors, and partners that may use Buena Vista Online's logo as part of a cobranding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Always be aware of where you end up. 

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online -- for example, via message boards or chat -- that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While Buena Vista Online strives to protect its users' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk. 

Security Policy

The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers, utilizing encryption software. 

Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access, each having signed comprehensive nondisclosure agreements, which provide explicit legal confidentiality protections. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution. 

Your Acceptance of These Terms

By using this site, you signify your assent to the Buena Vista Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued use of the Buena Vista Online sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
