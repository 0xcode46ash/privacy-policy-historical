# Moving.com: Changing the way people move

|  Moving.com is committed to respecting your privacy. We want to provide a safe, secure user experience. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private and is used only for the purposes stated below. This notice reflects our commitment to you and applies to all information collected or submitted on the Moving.com web site. By visiting Moving.com, you are accepting the practices described in this notice. 

**What Information Do We Collect At Moving.com?**  


**General Information**  
We automatically gather information about all users collectively, such as, for example, what areas of Moving.com users visit most frequently, what web sites they came from, what computer platform they use and what services on Moving.com they access most frequently. 

This data helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users and how to continually create a better overall experience for them. This data does not include personally identifying information, and we use this general information only in aggregate form. 

**Personal Information**  
In order to provide some of the services on Moving.com, we ask you to provide personal information such as, for example, your name, e-mail address, home address, move date and account numbers. In addition, from time-to-time, we may ask you for additional information, such as, for example, information and feedback about your interests and opinions. We only collect this personal information if you provide it to us voluntarily. 

We use the information we collect for a variety of purposes, such as responding to your requests, customizing your experience on our web site, improving our services, and communicating with you about your account and about products and services that we think will be of interest to you. 

**Do We Share The Information We Collect?**  
We share customer information with the other divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates of our parent company, TMP Directional Marketing and with third parties only as described below. 

We occasionally share general information about our web site with advertisers and other Moving.com partners so they can learn how Moving.com visitors tend to navigate through the site. As described above, this general information does not include any personally identifying information. 

In order to create an account with Address Changer, our change of address service, and the Move Planner, you must provide an e-mail address. You may, either upon registering with Moving.com or any time thereafter, request that Moving.com not send any further communications to that e-mail address. If you choose to use Address Central, you may indicate certain companies for us to notify of your move. We provide the information you give us in connection with the Address Changer service to those companies. Each of those companies has its own policies with regard to the collection and use of personal information and Moving.com is not responsible for their use of your information. 

In addition, other companies occasionally make special offers available directly to Moving.com customers. You will have an opportunity to receive information about these offers. If you request to receive information about these offers, we will share your personal information with these companies so that they can send you details about their special offers. Each of these companies has its own policies with regard to the collection and use of personal information and Moving.com is not responsible for their use of your information. 

We work closely with certain business partners to provide you with high quality products and services. With some of these businesses, we will share the personal information that you provide us if it is relevant to the services that our partner provides to you. We presently share information with our partners in connection with the following co-branded services that they offer through Moving.com: 

  * Environmental Report 
  * Find a Home 
  * Find an Apartment 
  * Locate an Agent 
  * Mortgage Pre-Application 
  * School Report 
  * Tax Advisor 
  * Utility Connection 

For example, before you may use the Mortgage Pre-Application service, you must first complete a form that asks for certain personal information (such as your name, email address and social security number), as well as information about your finances, employment and the property you want to mortgage. At your direction (by clicking the “Submit” button), we will forward this information to the participating lender of your choice, who may then contact you about applying for a mortgage, and use the information to assist you in that process. 

With respect to the Mortgage Pre-Application Service, Moving.com does not permit our participating lenders to use the information that you provide in your mortgage pre-application, other than in connection with helping you obtain a mortgage. Moving.com, however, has no control over how the participating lenders use personal information gathered directly on their sites. Also, with respect to our other business partners, each has its own posted policies with regard to the collection and use of personal information and Moving.com is not responsible for their use of your information. In addition, Moving.com contains many links to other companies' web sites. Moving.com is not responsible for the privacy or other practices or the content of such web sites. 

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These other companies will have access to your personal information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law. 

If Moving.com or our parent company, TMP Directional Marketing. (or substantially all of our or its assets) are acquired, we expect that customer information would be transferred along with the other business assets. 

To the extent permitted by law, we may also share your personal information if we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to enforce or apply our Terms of Use, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Moving.com or our users. This may include, for example, sharing information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

Other than as described above, we will provide you notice when we propose to share your personal information with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share that information. 

**Updating Account Information**  
Moving.com encourages you to review the personal identifying information we have collected about you, and to change, correct inaccuracies, or update that information at any time. You can do this by logging into any of the utilities provided directly by us through our web site, such as the Move Planner or Address Changer, and clicking on "Update Account Information." When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records. 

**Deleting Information**  
We will no longer use or disclose any personally identifying information we have collected about you if you send an email requesting that we remove your personal information from our active files. Please [click here](https://web.archive.org/Contact_Us/) if you wish to have your personal information removed. Please include your full name and the e-mail address that you used to register with us in the request. Please note that this will only remove your personal information from our files and not from the files of our business partners or other third parties with whom we have shared your information as permitted under this policy. 

**Online Security**  
We use Secure Socket Layer 128-bit encryption technology and a secure internal computer system to protect personal identifying information used on Moving.com. While this technology does not completely guarantee the security of your information, it does make it very difficult for information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred and stored. 

**Cookies**  
A "cookie" is an element of data that a web site can send to a browser, which then may get stored on a computer. The cookie can be used to identify a repeat user to the site that placed the cookie on the computer. Cookies also can be used to track your movement from page to page, or within a single page of a web site. Some of Moving.com's web pages use cookies. For example, you receive a cookie when you access the Move Planner and Address Changer. 

Moving.com uses cookies because, among other things, they allow us to personalize content, banners, and promotions that you see on our site. We also use information obtained from cookies to learn how you navigate through Moving.com. 

You can set your browser software to notify you when receiving a cookie, and you have the option not to accept cookies at all. Because some of our services require the use of cookies, if you refuse to accept cookies or if you remove a cookie that is on your computer, it will affect your ability to log into certain areas and your ability to use certain of the tools and content on Moving.com. 

**Contact Us**  
Moving.com encourages you to give us feedback. Please [click here](https://web.archive.org/Contact_Us/) to submit your feedback. Any feedback that is submitted becomes the property of Moving.com. Feedback, such as customer suggestions or testimonials, may be used for a variety of purposes, including, for example, our marketing purposes or to contact users about our site. 

**Terms of Use and Privacy Commitment Changes**  
If you choose to visit Moving.com, your visit and any dispute about the use of your personal information will be governed by this Privacy Notice and by our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/About_us/Disclaimer/index.asp) . As our business changes, we may need to revise our Privacy Notice and Terms of Use. You will, of course, have the opportunity to change your privacy preferences at any time or delete your information from our active files. Please be aware that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, our use of information is governed by the Privacy Notice in effect at the time we use the information. Please [click here](https://web.archive.org/Contact_Us/) to submit your questions, comments or concerns about Moving.com's Privacy Policy.
