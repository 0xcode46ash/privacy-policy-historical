Privacy Statement

MovieTickets.com, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the MovieTickets.com website. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin. 

Our site uses cookies to make sure that you do not see the same ad repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password and zip code so you do not have to re-enter them each time you visit our site. 

Through surveys and newsletter registration, our site may request users to give us contact, demographic, and/or financial information (such as their name, locale, gender, age, income level and email address). The demographic information is used to enhance user experience so we can be more content specific.

Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as their name and email address) and demographic information (such as their zip code, age, and/or income level). The user's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary, such as if they win a contest or to notify users of upcoming contests. There are three primary types of contests: (1) We host solely and all information that is collected stays in-house. (2) We may share address information with a third party for shipping purposes. (3) In some rare instances, a third party may host the contest and all information is then shared. In our contest registration, we give our users the opportunity to sign up for the MovieTickets.com newsletter. However, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by selecting the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the newsletter.
