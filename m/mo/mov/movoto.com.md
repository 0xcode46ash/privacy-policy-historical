# Movoto - San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties Real Estate - Privacy Policy

Movoto takes your privacy seriously. At Movoto we created this policy to demonstrate our commitment to ensuring that your personal information remains safe and secure. For information about safe surfing from the FTC, see [ http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee.htm](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee.htm) .

This policy applies to the Movoto website(s) and covers how Movoto collects and treats information that is personally identifiable, like name, address, email address or phone number. At its sole discretion, Movoto will update this privacy policy statement from time to time. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Privacy Policy and any applicable changes. Continued use of the service after any changes take effect will constitute your acceptance of such changes. You can review the current version of this Privacy Policy at any time at [http://www.movoto.com](http://www.movoto.com/) . 

**I. What personally identifiable information is collected?**   
  
There are times when we may need information from you, for instance, to get property search criteria or to set up your account. We may collect additional information to customize the site for you, to communicate with you, to complete a transaction, or to enhance the service.

**Information You Give Us**

We receive and store your account information during registration. When you register, we ask for information such as your name, email address, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. We also receive and store your searches for housing information, including search terms and settings.

**Automatic Information  
**   
We automatically track certain information to understand how the site is used and how we can improve your overall experience and offer additional functionality, products and services. This information includes the IP address, browser type, operating system, URLs and referring URLs. Our website uses cookies to keep track of this information while you are visiting or using Movoto. Cookies are very small files placed on your computer so that, when you return to Movoto, we can identify you. Cookies are needed for the Movoto site to operate properly. 

We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The information we collect may be personally identifiable and includes the pages visited, search terms used, time on the site and completion of certain tasks on the site. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company manages the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can opt-out of our ability to analyze such data by clicking here <http://metric.movoto.com/optout.html>. 

**II. How is personally identifiable information used and shared?**

When appropriate, we will ask for information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information will be requested when you register for a Movoto account, perform property searches, or request other information through our site. Movoto uses this information for the purpose of fulfilling your requests for products and services, improving our services, conducting research, and customizing the content and advertising you see. 

When you provide your personal information to Movoto, you agree that Movoto may use that information to contact you. For example, we may send you e-mail communications related to real estate information, services or products that we believe may be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive such e-mails from Movoto, contact us at privacy@movoto.com or click on the "opt-out" link contained in the e-mails. 

User profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. Some of this information may be shared with third-party companies on an aggregate basis. We may occasionally hire other companies to provide services on our behalf. In this situation, we will only provide such companies with the information they need to provide the service. They will be prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

Movoto does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or when we work with trusted partners. Movoto will also disclose your personal information if Movoto reasonably believes that it must do so in order to comply with any applicable law, valid legal process or governmental request; in order to enforce the T&C or Privacy Policy; or in order to protect the rights of Movoto employees, Movoto users, or third parties.

**III. Your ability to change your privacy settings  
**   
You may opt out of receiving e-mail updates and alerts. Your account can be deactivated by contacting Movoto at [privacy@movoto.com](mailto:privacy@movoto.com) . You may also turn off cookies in your browser. 

**IV. Security measures to protect your information**

We limit access to your personal information to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information in order to provide you with products or services or in order to do their jobs.
