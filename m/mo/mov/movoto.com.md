Some of this information may be shared with third-party companies on an aggregate basis. We may occasionally hire other companies to provide services on our behalf. In this situation, we will only provide such companies with the information they need to provide the service. They will be prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

Movoto does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or when we work with trusted partners under confidentiality agreements. Movoto will also disclose your personal information if Movoto reasonably believes that it must do so in order to comply with any applicable law, valid legal process or governmental request; in order to enforce the T&C or Privacy Policy; or in order to protect the rights of Movoto employees, Movoto users, or third parties.
