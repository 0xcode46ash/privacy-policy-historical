### About Movie Insider®

Movie Insider offers behind-the-scenes film information about upcoming Hollywood releases. Movies are tracked and updated through all stages of film production from concept/announcement, development, production, post-production and finally to release. 

Historical Background

Movie Insider was first launched on AOL Hometown in July 1999, by its founder, Brian D. Renner, who was age 13 at the time. Then, the mission of the Movie Insider was "to keep you and everyone else up to date about the world of movies". Not long after, the Movie Insider moved to _Yahoo! Geocities_ and some other free hosts, followed by its first domain name "movie-insider.com" in early 2000. Soon after a third-party ownership debacle regarding the aforementioned domain name, Brian purchased "themovieinsider.com" in early September 2001. Since 2001, the Movie Insider has gone through numerous recreations and redesigns. Many are available for review by using the [Internet Archive's WayBack Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.themovieinsider.com). 

With an October 2010 domain arbritration case, Brian was granted "movieinsider.com" from a recognized domain squatter and eventually migrated the Movie Insider from "themovieinsider.com" to "movieinsider.com". In 2012, Brian finally secured "movie-insider.com" again too!  Movie Insider has grown from a thousand visitors in the early 2000s to over one million visitors a month today.
