 ** _Over 20 years experience in protecting confidentiality…_**

Movies Unlimited has been processing customers' video orders for over 20 years through our world-renowned print catalog. Over the years, more than one million customers' personal information has always been protected against unauthorized usage and now, shopping online remains just as safe. ** __**

 ** _Your privacy is most important to us…_**

We ask for your email address only so that we can confirm your order and to let you know about video information that we are sure will be of interest to you. We do not sell or rent your email address to outside parties. In addition, we do not provide statistics about our customers or their sales histories, shopping patterns, or other website related information to any other company. If ever a decision is made to provide such data, we pledge that these statistics will never include any information that can identify you personally in any way. ** __**

 ** _Our Mailing List…_**

Movies Unlimited maintains two discrete mailing lists for our online and off-line customer bases. When a consumer joins either customer base, we add their name to our mailing list to receive our print catalogs, which give additional information about our products. Our catalog is respected throughout the industry and recommended by critics everywhere. **Movies Unlimited does not share its online customer mailing list with outside companies.** The Movies Unlimited off-line customer mailing list is occasionally made available to very carefully screened companies who offer products and services that may be of interest to our customers. If any customer prefers NOT receiving our mailings, or any off-line customer wishes not to have their information released to outside companies, please send a note with your name and address to: Movies Unlimited, 3015 Darnell Road., Phila., PA 19154. Allow 6-8 weeks for your request to be processed. ** __**

 ** _We're always up front with our customers…_**

When you shop with us, you are in effect, giving your consent to use your email address to confirm your order and to keep you informed about new releases and upcoming specials. If we ever decide to change our policies about your email address, we will make those changes available on our website so that you will always be made aware of how we use that information.
