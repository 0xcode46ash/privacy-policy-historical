# MOL - Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and those set forth in the Terms and Conditions, 1800ASSIST.com Sdn Bhd is not willing to permit you to use the Web Site or its services. 

1800ASSIST.com (hereinafter MOL.com), is committed to protecting the privacy of our Members and users (hereinafter "you"). For a variety of reasons, including our desire to maintain your privacy at the highest levels in a rapidly changing industry, we may occasionally revise our privacy policy.

  1. **Minors and Children**  
Minors and children (people under the age of 18) are not authorised to use our services without adult or guardian supervision. If you are under 18, you must have parental or guardian permission to use the service. 
  2. **What We Collect and Why**  
In general, we will always try to make it clear to you why we are collecting information and for what purpose the information will be used. At this time, your information is to be gathered for registration and membership services and for on-line marketing surveys.

Registration and membership services. Our registration form requires you to give us demographic information like your post code, age, and gender. We also require you to provide us with your email address so that we may contact you when appropriate or to send information about us or our services (e.g., agreement amendments or service expansions). Other demographic and profile data may also be collected through our service. We use this data to display content that appeals to the preferences of our users. This information may be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis (thus advertisers learn general information about our users but not individual names, e-mail addresses, etc.). 

For the online surveys. From time to time, we may provide you with the option to participate in online surveys that may ask you for demographic information. We, or a third party, may use your responses to send you additional information related to topics in which you have indicated an interest. If we, instead of a third party, send you additional information based on such a survey, we will always respect your e-mail or written request for us to stop sending such information. If you do not trust the third party that is conducting or affiliated with the survey, you do not have to participate in the survey. Whether you choose to participate in on-line surveys, and whether you wish to provide information to complete an on-line survey is always voluntary. 

  3. **We treat personal information as confidential**  
In general. We may disclose aggregate or summary information obtained by combining data from you and many other individuals, but in such situations the name and email address (and possibly other identifiers) will have been removed. We treat your personal information as confidential and do not disclose it to any third party unless you request us to do so, or: 

(1) as necessary to offer you support services; For example, if you have help questions that cannot be answered by our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) database, we may refer you and your question to an independent support services partner. To properly answer your question, your e-mail address may be required.

(2) to verify purchases or prevent fraud; For example, we may exchange details of your purchases with merchants with whom you have made or attempted to make purchases to verify that the transactions were completed and have not been cancelled. 

(3) for redemption purposes; For example, if you win a prize or Benefit that needs to be physically delivered, we or one of our agents, will ask for your courier information. 

(4) if required or authorized by legal authorities. For example, if we suspect fraud or illegal conduct by a Member, we may investigate and report any evidence, including personally identifiable information to legal authorities. 

  4. **We Provide Users with Security and Safeguards**  
We maintain security measures. We do not pass around information about you to the public. However we do provide information about our members to strictly to other MOL.com vortals for the purpose of announcing promotions and bargains. Moreover, perfect security over the Internet is not yet available and therefore you indemnify and hold us harmless always against such breeches.
  5. **Your Password**  
To fully access our services, you will be asked to choose a user name and password, which you must keep confidential. These devices are virtual keys used to access information we hold about you. In the event that you suspect the confidentiality of your user name and password has been violated, you agree to contact us immediately (at the address below) so we may take steps to secure your account. It is impossible to eliminate accidental disclosures and unintended access and modification of accounts completely; thus we are not liable for any loss or damage caused by such actions. You are responsible for all loss, damages, and liabilities arising from the use of your user name and password, whether such use was authorized by you or not and whether or not you have reported any unauthorized use to us. 
  6. **Technical Information**  
When you use our services, our system automatically tracks certain elements needed to get a better aggregate picture of our users. This information frequently allows us to better tailor our services to meet the needs of our users. For example, we may track and find it useful to know the sites most users visit before and after visiting our site. Also, we may track information for purposes of auditing advertising.

If you visit restricted pages (for example, to check or change your account), our software may use cookies for identification in the future, although this is not being done currently. This means that you only have to log on with your password once if you perform several transactions during the same browser session. However if you shut down your browser completely, as a security measure we require you to input a password when you return. For authorized use of the services we provide, you may need to accept our cookies. 

We strive to keep all personal information accurate, complete, and up-to-date. Nonetheless, we may reduce the amount of data associated with users by converting it into summary statistics or destroying it. We are not to be held liable for such actions or for the accuracy of your personal information. 

  7. **Your control over and access to your information**  
You control the quantity and quality of the information we receive from you about you. If you provide us with information, you agree to provide only truthful, accurate, and non-misleading information. You may access or verify your account information, by going to your [my account](https://web.archive.org/servlet/report.MntPntStm) page.

At anytime, if you wish to have your account and related information erased, you may notify us by canceling your membership and contacting us at the e-mail address or the physical address mentioned at the end of this Privacy Policy. 

  8. **Anti-Spam policy**  
We strongly oppose unsolicited junk email (also known as "spam"). We reserve the right to terminate services, cancel benefits, and possibly take legal action against any users who we have reason to believe are directly or indirectly sending spam.
