# Website privacy policy | Mollom

This document explains your rights and obligations on the mollom.com website. We have tried to make it as short and readable as possible, but please read it carefully because you are bound by its content when using this website.

This document covers only the part of our website that deals with the commercial and technical information about our company and our services, such as [our blog](https://web.archive.org/blog). This document does **not** cover the use of our web service or the [software you can download from this website](https://web.archive.org/download).

## Disclaimer

The mollom.com website contains a lot of information. We created some of it ourselves, while our visitors have created other parts of it. Although we carefully draft the information we publish and we try to correct any mistakes as soon as possible, you should be aware that you use any of the information on this website at your own risk. You should be _even more careful_ when using the visitor-contributed information like the comments of [our blog posts](https://web.archive.org/blog). This means that – to the furthest extent permissible by law – we are not "contractually" or "extracontractually" responsible, in any way, for any harm this website (or any external website we link to) might cause you … unless, of course, we publish information that is intentionally fraudulent or harmful information – consider this unlikely!

## Participation

When you participate in comment discussions attached to blog posts, you are responsible for what you post. Although we will not screen all contributed content, we reserve the right to remove anything we deem inappropriate, without any possibility of recourse or redress on your part.

Be aware that some users will rely on the content of your posts. You – and not Mollom BVBA – are responsible for your posts, and you hereby fully indemnify us from any claim we might receive from third parties harmed by your content.

## Privacy

We take privacy seriously. When you visit our website, our servers collect some technical information about you (web browser type, IP address) and also track which pages you visit on our site, for a period of up to 24 months. As long as you are not logged in, this information is fairly anonymous and we will use it only to create anonymous statistics (which we may sell to third parties). We may also provide the information collected about you if, in cases of fraud or other criminal activities, we are subpoenaed to do so by competent legal authorities.

If you post to our blogs, you need to become a registered user and you will, of course, leave some additional traces of your identity: contact details, log in, etc. However, unless we are legally forced to do so, we will not combine our server logs to create detailed tracking of your behavior or sessions on our website.

This website uses several cookies. They store technical information that allows us to better interact with your browser and to identify you on subsequent visits to our site.

This website also uses Google Analytics to collect non-identifying and aggregate information to improve our website.
