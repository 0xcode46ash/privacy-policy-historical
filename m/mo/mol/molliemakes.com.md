This Privacy Policy applies to Immediate Media Company Limited and (in the case of our Jewellery Maker and Sewing Quarter brands) Immediate Media TV Limited as the “data controller” responsible for your personal information. However, this policy also applies to the other companies in the Immediate group who may handle your personal information too (see “[Who we share your information with](https://policies.immediate.co.uk/privacy/who-we-share-your-information-with/)” for further details).

This policy may be updated from time to time to keep up with legal and/or business developments, so you should check it each time you submit information to any of our services. The date of the most recent changes to each section of the policy will appear at the top of the relevant page.
