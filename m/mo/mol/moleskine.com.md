_3. **DATA PROCESSED AND PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING**  
_

Simply visiting the website does not, in itself, lead to the collection or processing of users' personal data. In any event, please refer to sections 6 and 7 of this privacy information for details regarding the importance, for the purposes of privacy, of the browsing data and cookies.

The data that are collected and then processed are normally limited to the user's forename and surname, his/her address, e-mail address, date of birth and country of residence.

If the provision of data leads to the establishment of a professional or commercial collaboration, further identification details of the person and/or the company and the activity performed by the latter may be requested. In no case is data defined as sensitive by current regulations to be collected.

In order to be registered as an Artist and gain access to the Moleskine Artist Marketplace, the User shall be asked to provide additional optional information - such as their Facebook and/or Twitter account - as well as a brief biographical description. Although providing this description is obligatory, it will not undergo any processing operations other than publication and diffusion on the Site.

Only in the cases where providing data leads to the establishment of a professional or commercial collaboration may further identification details of the person and/or the company and the activity performed by the latter be requested. In no case is the collection of data defined as sensitive by current regulations planned.

Unless otherwise stated, providing the data requested from time to time is mandatory for the purpose of upgrading the procedures of access to the reserved areas of the website or to other specific functions.

The required or optional nature of the provision of data that Moleskine reserves the right to request in future also from users who have already registered, will be specified from time to time, together with the purposes justifying the request for such further information to be provided.

The aims of data processing are varied, depending on the section of the website containing the request for data to be provided. In particular:

MSK: use of the customization tools made available to users does not presuppose the acquisition, as such, of any personal data concerning them. The information that the user himself/herself prepares through the aforesaid tools, however, generates an image file - made available to the user as a print output - which is retained solely for technical requirements for a period of no more than 10 days, after which time it will be deleted. During this period the data, information and contents in general, provided by the user will not be subjected to processing.

Journalists: the user's personal data will be processed in order to qualify the User as a journalist and, as such, allow him/her access to a reserved area in which he/she will find information in the form of text and photographs intended to be used for Moleskine communications.
