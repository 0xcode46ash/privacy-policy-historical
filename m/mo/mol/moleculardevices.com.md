In addition, when you visit our Site, we may obtain certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons.    The information we obtain in this manner includes IP address, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, geographic location, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our site, and dates and times of website visits.    A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.  A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.  Through these automated collection methods, we obtain “clickstream data,” which is a log of content on which a visitor clicks while browsing a website.    As the visitor clicks through the website, a record of the action may be collected and stored.    Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies.  Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Site.  

To the extent required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before collecting information using cookies or similar automated means.

In addition, we use information collected online through cookies, web beacons and other automated means for purposes such as (i) customizing our users’ visits to our Site, (ii) delivering content (including advertising) tailored to our users’ interests and the manner in which our users browse our Site, and (iii) managing our business.  We also use this information to help diagnose technical and service problems, administer our Site, identify users of our Site, and gather demographic information about our users.    We use clickstream data to determine how much time users spend on web pages of our Site, how users navigate through our Site, and how we may tailor our Site to better meet the needs of our users.    
We may use third party web analytics services on this Site, such as those of Google Analytics and ActOn.  The service providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons to help us analyze how visitors use the Site.  The information collected through these means (including IP address) is disclosed to these service providers, who use the information to evaluate use of the Site.  To learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out, please visit [www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).  Act-On may use certain other information collected from you to help diagnose technical problems, administer this website, and improve the quality and types of services delivered. ActOn complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

We also may use the information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.  

_**Online Tracking **_  
On the Site, we may collect information about your online activities for use in providing you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests.    This section of our Global Privacy Notice provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.

You may see certain ads on other websites based on your visits to our Site because we participate in advertising networks administered by third-party vendors.    Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users’ inferred interests and browsing context.  These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons.  The networks use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests.  The information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the vendors’ advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites.  This data collection takes place both on our Site and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks.  This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.  To learn more about how to opt out of ad network interest-based advertising, [click here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).  

We utilize Google Display Advertising (such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting) to (1) show you our ads on other websites based on your prior visits to our Site, and (2) better understand our ad impressions and use of ad services.   In connection with the Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting service, we may use data from Google’s interest-based advertising or third-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) with Google Analytics to understand and improve our marketing campaigns and Site content.  

Some of our online advertising takes place through Google Display Advertising.  As part of this program, we use Google Analytics features such as Retargeting.  In connection with that feature and others offered by ad networks, we and the operators of ad networks, including Google, may use third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) – and in some cases first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) – to inform, optimize and serve ads across the Internet based on a user’s past visits to our Site.  We also may show you ads from some of our affiliates when you visit our Site.

You can opt out of Google AdWords remarketing service and Google Analytics for Display Advertising by clicking [here](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences). Our Site is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers.

_**Information We Share**_  

We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information we collect about you, except as described here.

We may share your personal information with:

  * Our affiliates and subsidiaries for the purposes described in this Global Privacy Notice.
  * Service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions.  We do not authorize these service providers to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.  Examples of these service providers include entities that respond to customer inquiries, process credit card payments, fulfill orders, and provide web hosting and marketing services.  
  * Other third parties with your consent.



In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials based on a lawful disclosure request, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.  

We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).

_**Access and Correction **_

To the extent provided by the law of your jurisdiction, you may (i) have the right to access certain personal information we maintain about you and obtain a copy of that information, (ii) update or correct inaccuracies in that information, (iii) object to our use of your personal information, and (iv) block or delete your personal information from our database.  To exercise these rights, please contact us as indicated in the How To Contact Us section of this Global Privacy Notice.  To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we may take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the information.  If you are resident in the EU, a charge may be applicable before we provide a copy to you of any of your personal information that we maintain.

_**Data Transfers**_

We may transfer the personal information we collect about you through the Site to countries other than the country in which the information originally was collected.  Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.  When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Global Privacy Notice.  If you are located in the European Union (“EU”) or Switzerland, we will comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to recipients in countries outside of the EU or Switzerland.  

_**How We Protect Personal Information**_

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.  

_**Links To Other Websites **_

Our Site may provide links to other websites for your convenience and information.  These websites may operate independently from us.  Linked websites may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked websites.  To the extent any linked websites you visit are not owned or controlled by us, we are not responsible for the websites’ content, any use of the websites, or the privacy practices of the websites.
