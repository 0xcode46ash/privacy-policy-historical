Mojostreet Infomedia Services Pvt. Ltd. (“ _mojostreet_ ,” “we,” or “us”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by _mojostreet_ when you use the _mojostreet_ Service. Additionally, it explains how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of such information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this policy are defined in our Terms of Use. Our expectation is that _mojostreet_ Users will use this service for harmless social purposes. We would like to extend a cautionary note however, that by its nature, your location information may be subject to misuse and over-monitoring by others including your friends, family, or acquaintances. We therefore request you to manage your own mobile and profile privacy preferences on the service on a periodic basis.

**What Information Is Collected?**

> **Sharing with friends**  
>  Your “friends” see the location and time of each of your check-ins, tips and photos (that you leave there), presidentships. While your friends will be able to see the time of your check-ins, other users will only be shown the date of the check-in. Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. Hence we urge you to exercise caution while adding a user as a “friend”.
