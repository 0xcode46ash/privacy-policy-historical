**Privacy policy** Motorsport.com is committed to protecting the personal information you choose to share with us. Below is our privacy guarantee and some additional information about how we gather information about our registered users, why we gather it, and what we do with it.

**We will not willfully disclose any individually identifiable information about you to any outside source without your express consent.**

 **General information**

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit Motorsport.com. Our third-party advertising company also separately places or recognizes a cookie file on your browser in the course of delivering advertisements to this site. These companies may use information ( **not** including your name, address email, address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

Please note: nothing in a cookie allows anyone to identify you individually. Your computer is assigned a number and that number is tracked using the cookie. This number is only meaningful in the context of our secure database system.

Other information that we ask you to share with us allows us to improve Motorsport.com and still keep it free. Aggregate demographic information about our users is valuable to our advertisers as it provides them with more effective channels for reaching potential customers. Without advertising support, we could not keep the site free for your use. We will never tell our advertisers your individual preferences or your individual contact information. Summary information about our registered members is all that we will report.
