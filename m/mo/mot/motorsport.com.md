# Motorsport.com: Corporate info

Motorsport.com is committed to protecting the personal information you choose to share with us. Below is our privacy guarantee and some additional information about how we gather information about our registered users, why we gather it, and what we do with it.

**We will not willfully disclose any individually identifiable information about you to any outside source without your express consent.**

## General information

We send to your web browser many of the advertisements you see when you use our network of Web sites. However, we also allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our web pages. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network Web site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from the site. Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. As always remember, we only authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any personally identifying information about you.

## Opting out of third-party ad servers

Although most Motorsport.com customers indicate that they welcome details of offers and other promotional material about Motorsport.com products and services and products and services provided by our business partners and advertisers, we acknowledge the right of our customers to choose. You will be given the right to opt-out of receiving such information whenever you are asked to provide information on this site. If you do not opt-out at that time, but later decide that you do not wish to receive future communications of this nature you can contact us as set out below, indicating that you no longer want to receive: (1) information relating to products and services provided by other companies, or (2) any information relating to products and services (including Motorsport.com products and services).

If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad network's Web site individually and opt out (if they offer this capability). Currently, we have relationships with the following third-party ad networks (click to visit their Web site): [Google AdSense.](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacypolicy.html)
