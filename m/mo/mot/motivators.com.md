How is our Web site secure?  
**The SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the most powerful encryption available on the Internet. This means that any information related to your credit card is encoded when being sent to us, so no one else is able to read it. You know that you are entering a secure area when the URL to the left of the colon changes from http to https. Also, your browser may have a special symbol, like a key or a lock.

Having a secure server takes the risk out of your credit card transactions. We also do all order processing on software that is separate from the Internet, so there is no danger of anyone gaining access to your order information..

Your credit card purchases are, as always, insured by your credit card company. This means there is absolutely no risk to you. We want you to feel totally at ease every time you visit our site to get information, request a sample and place an order.
