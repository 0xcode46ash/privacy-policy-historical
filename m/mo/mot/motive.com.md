**Our Commitment to Privacy and Protection of Your Personal Data**

Alcatel-Lucent International, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcatel-Lucent, and all Alcatel-Lucent legal entities (collectively “Alcatel-Lucent”) recognize that our employees, and the individuals who represent companies with whom we conduct business, value their privacy. However, in order to conduct a global business in this increasingly electronic economy, the collection of the personal data of individuals is often necessary. We respect your right to privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. It is our goal to balance the benefits of e-commerce with your right, as an individual, to prevent the misuse of your personal data.

**What Is Personal Data**

Personal data means any information that, when used alone or combined with other data, may be used to identify an individual. This includes, but is not limited to, an individual’s first and last name, e-mail address, mailing and/or residential addresses, telephone number, title, birth date, gender, occupation, customer contact information and/or other personal information that may be required in order for us to provide a service you request, or may have requested, at our web sites.

**Compliance With Laws**

Alcatel-Lucent strives to comply with all applicable and known laws around the world that are designed to protect your right to privacy and prevent misuse of your personal data. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, we intend to adhere to the principles set forth in this Global Privacy and Data Protection Web Site Policy Statement even if we transfer your personal data from your country of residence to countries that may not provide the same privacy rights or require the same level of protection for your personal data. Our commitment is to protect your personal data no matter where it is collected, transported, processed or retained.

**US Subsidiary - Safe Harbor Privacy Statement**
