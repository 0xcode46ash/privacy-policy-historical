**What personal information does mo’time collect?**

The only personal information that mo’time requests during the registration process is your email address and a user name of your own choosing. 

At some future time, we may offer you the possibility to create a personal profile, which could include other personal information. Any additional personal information that you submit to mo’time will be protected under the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. 

**Technical Information**

Every time you visit a page on the Internet, your web browser sends specific information to the web site you are visiting. mo’time's web server logs automatically collect and store this information from your browser, including your IP address, specific type and version of browse, mo’time-related cookies (see below), and the pages you visit at mo'time. 

We use this information primarily to help diagnose and fix any technical problems that you may encounter. But we also use IP information to help us limit access to mo’time by users who have violated our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/node/view/139395) (or to help users block access to their mo’time sites by other users). 

_Cookies_

Like most sites that have features requiring registration and sign-in, mo’time uses cookies to recognize you when you return to mo’time and to keep track of your username and password when you are signed in (so you don't have to re-sign in every time you visit a new page at mo'time). 

This site is now conducting a test of the ImetriX.biz site measurement system, to analyze our traffic, to optimize content and site performance. ImetriX respects your privacy by not collecting data about you, but uses only one cookie which assigns you a random number. For more information we invite you to visit: [ http://www.imetrix.biz/legal/netprivacy.html](http://www.imetrix.biz/legal/netprivacy.html)

**Who else collects personal information from me?**

Any personal information that you volunteer on www.motime.com is collected by _mo’time alone_ , unless specifically noted otherwise. 

**How does mo’time use my personal information?**

motime.com uses your personal information primarily to customize your experience using the service. The more information you volunteer, the better we can personalize mo’time's products and services to match your needs and interests. 

mo’time uses your email address only to confirm your account and contact you in case of any problems with your account. Upon your request, mo’time may forward additional information to your email address including, but not limited to, messages from visitors to your mo’time site or additional information about developments with respect to our services. 

To continue to provide the basic free service, mo’time may display advertisements or other promotional information. Any additional personal information that you volunteer will help mo’time customize the advertisements it displays to match your interests. 

mo’time does not share any personally identifiable information with advertisers. mo’time may share general demographic information with advertisers and business partners (such as aggregated statistics about members' interests and occupations). But mo’time never gives advertisers access to your individual personal account information. 

**What can I do to protect my mo’time account?**

Be careful to keep your mo’time username and password secret! Anyone who knows your username and password can log onto your mo’time account. 

If you are using a shared computer to access your mo'time account, remember to log out of mo’time before you leave that computer. If you forget to log out, the next person who uses that shared computer may have access to your mo’time account. 

To minimize the risk of other people accessing your private mo’time account, we suggest you log out of mo’time before you leave any computer that you use, even a personal one. 

**What does mo’time do to protect my private and personal information?**

motime.com has built a secure infrastructure to safeguard your private information. We will continue to do everything we can to maintain and improve the security of our network. After all, every mo’time employee is also an active mo’time member. We all understand the importance of maintaining a secure system for our private and personal information. 

No data transmission over the Internet, however, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Although mo’time pledges to put forth its best efforts to protect your private information, mo’time cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. For further information on this subject, please see our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/node/view/139395) .

**Children's Privacy**

mo’time is intended for use by people who are at least 13 years old, and we will not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. 

We have designed our registration process to make it clear that you must be at least 13 years old to participate in the mo’time community.

_Special Note to Parents_

If you are the Parent or Legal Guardian of a child under 13 who has become a mo’time member and you would like his or her account deleted, please email us at: [info@motime.com](mailto:info@motime.com). As soon as we are able to verify your identity (and status as parent or legal guardian) we will immediately delete your child's account. You may also request to see a copy of any information that has been submitted by your child, prior to the account being deleted from our systems. 

For more information about the kinds of personally identifiable information collected by mo’time, how it is collected, and how it is used by mo’time, please review this Privacy Policy as well as the mo’time [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/node/view/139395).

**Is there anything else I should know about privacy issues?**

We will do everything in our power to maintain your privacy and online security. Strong privacy and security, however, requires effort from both motime.com and its members. Please be sure to follow the advice listed above for protecting your mo’time account. The best way to protect your privacy is to protect your password; change your password often, and keep it secret, even from motime.com employees. Remember that motime.com employees will never ask you for your password!
