For example, cookies can identify visitors' zip codes. This way you don't have to tell us over and over again in which state you live. Secondly, Motorcycle USA uses cookies to track user trends and patterns. This helps Motorcycle USA better understand and improve this Website and its services. While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to this Website should have the option of disabling cookies through their browser preferences.

For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement link or if you click on a Third Party Provider link, the "click" may take you from this Website to the website of that other person.
