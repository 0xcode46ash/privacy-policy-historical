COOKIES

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Generally, cookies work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of our site. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information; we use them to provide features such as personalization, to save your member ID and to keep track of your shopping cart. We may also use cookies to assist us in delivering content specific to your interests. Additionally, after you've entered your member ID and password during a session on our service, we save that information so you don't have to re-enter it repeatedly during that session. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Not accepting cookies may make certain features of MotionBased Web Site unavailable to you. We may use your IP address to identify you, to administer our Web Site and to assist in diagnosing problems with our server.

ADDITONAL USES INFORMATION

All of the information we collect, both what you tell us and what we collect through the use of cookies, is used to personalize your account, to customize our services and to allow our customer service representatives to contact you when necessary. It is MotionBased's policy not to release any personally identifying information about you without your consent (usually obtained through an "opt-out" option that you may select when providing the information). In most cases, information will be released only on an aggregated basis (meaning that the information from many MotionBased users is grouped together in a way that does not disclose the personal information of any particular user). We may use contact information that you provide to send you information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. MotionBased will disclose personal information about an individual user if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with an applicable law or valid legal process.

EMAIL A FRIEND

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our Site or for emailing a trek to a friend, we ask them for the friend's email address. MotionBased will automatically send the friend a one-time email. MotionBased does not permanently store this information.

LOG FILES

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.
