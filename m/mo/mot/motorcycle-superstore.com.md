**Information Collection and Use**  
MotorcycleUSA.com, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 

**ORDER**  
We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

**COOKIES**  
A Cookie is a piece of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're at our site. The use of cookies is an Industry standard, and you'll find cookies at most major Web sites. 

**EXAMPLES OF HOW MOTORCYCLEUSA.COM USES COOKIES**  
The MotorcycleUSA.com bulletin board uses cookies to store the following information: the last time you logged in, your username and password, and your preferred "topic view", if you set it in preferences. These cookies are stored on your browser. Also, you need to have cookies enabled in your browser if you want to enter a private forum or shop in our Superstore. Also, MotorcycleUSA.com Inc. also uses cookies to let the computer remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. Cookies are not used to track your movement or perform any function other than to enhance your use of our site. If a user rejects cookies or their browser does not support cookies, they may still use our site, but the user will be limited in some areas of our site and will not be able to purchase items through our Superstore. 

**LOG FILES**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**SHARING**  
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.   
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.   
We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.   
These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

**LINKS**  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**NEWSLETTER**  
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. 

**SURVEY & CONTESTS**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

**TELL-A-FRIEND**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact MotorcycleUSA.com, Inc at [privacy@motorcycleusa.com](mailto:privacy@motorcycle-usa.com) to request the removal of this information from our database. 

**SECURITY POLICY**  
The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our Guests is of utmost concern. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers, utilizing encryption software. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access, each having signed compressive nondisclosure agreements, which provides explicit legal confidentiality protections. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution.   
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [privacy@motorcycleusa.com](mailto:privacy@motorcycle-usa.com). 

**SPECIAL OFFERS**  
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below. 

**SITE & SERVICE UPDATES**  
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

**CORRECTION/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our Customer Support. 

**CHOICE/OPT-OUT**  
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.   
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at [privacy@motorcycle-usa.com](mailto:privacy@motorcycle-usa.com).  
Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. 

**AOL**  
As an AOL Certified Merchant, we have agreed to abide by the principles outlined in [AOL's Privacy Policy](http://legal.web.aol.com/policy/aolpol/privpol.html).
