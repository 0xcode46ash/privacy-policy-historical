**Information We Collect**
    In designing our website, we started with the simple belief that customer service is our number one priority. Therefore the customer information we collect is used to enhance our services to you, our customer. Specific areas from which we collect data include: 

  * **Membership.** Prior to checking out, we ask our customers to become a Mothernature.com Member. To ensure easy shopping and timely product delivery we ask for shipping information including your email address and phone number so we can quickly communicate with you about the status of your order. Additionally, we ask for limited demographic information including your birth-date and gender, which enables us to continually update our site to better meet the needs of our members. Should you wish to change your membership information, simply click on [Your Account](https://web.archive.org/asp/membership.asp) or call our customer service department at (800) 517-9020 or (215) 355-3864; Fax (215) 355-9011, Monday through Friday 9am-9pm EST. Please also note that while we can make your account inactive and ensure that MotherNature.com in the future does not contact you, due to our quality control practices, we cannot delete member files. 
  * **E-mail newsletters.** We give our members the option to sign up for our weekly newsletter. This service is meant to better assist you to make informed decisions about your health, as well as the health of your family and friends. To sign you up we simply need an e-mail address. Subscriptions can be canceled at any time. In addition, you may unsubscribe to any of the free personalized e-mail services you have chosen at any time, without any future correspondence or questions. Please send your comments and complaints to [newsletter@mothernature.com](mailto:newsletter@mothernature.com). If you do not wish to receive product and health information updates from us, simply send an email with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line of the message. 
  * **Purchases.** When you order from MotherNature.com, we ask for your name, address, and credit card - all of which are necessary for purchase and delivery. To protect our members, we use Netscape's Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt the information you send us when you place your order. The information is encrypted on your computer, sent through the Internet as jumbled code, and decoded on MotherNature.com's secure server. It cannot be read in transit. 


**Personal Shopping Accounts**
     This service is intended to make shopping easier for you. Our experienced [Personal Shopper](https://web.archive.org/help/personal.asp) can identify products that meet your needs, based on the information you provide. Only a licensed medical practitioner can diagnose health conditions and prescribe remedies. However, our Personal Shopper is able to identify and pick products commonly associated with specific needs, such as high cholesterol, prostate care, menstrual health, viral immunity, and bone density. Our Personal Shopper will place the products he or she recommends into a shopping cart for you. You will then be free to review the cart's contents and to remove or add to your order as you wish. 

You may choose at any time whether or not to take advantage of the service or the products our Personal Shopper suggests. 

**Cookies**
    Our cookies, which are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive, allow us to automatically link our customers to their personalized accounts, including shopping baskets and Personal Shopping Accounts. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies. Please check your browser's guidelines should you wish to prevent cookies. 
**Parental Consent**
    Our privacy policy prohibits us from accepting members who are under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 are free to explore our site, but should they wish to become members or make a purchase we require that they do so through their parents' account. Should you have additional questions or concerns, please contact our customer service department at [CustomerService@MotherNature.com](mailto:customerservice@mothernature.com).
