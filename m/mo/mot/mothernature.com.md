**Our Secure Ordering**  
At MotherNature.com we use Netscape's Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt the information you send us when you place your order. The information is encrypted on your computer, sent through the Internet as jumbled code, and decoded on MotherNature.com's secure server. It cannot be read in transit.

MotherNature.com employees who handle customer data, such as customer service representatives, learn about security policy and practices as part of their job training. MotherNature.com notifies staff of changes in security policy via postings in an in-house Microsoft Outlook folder designated for customer service security postings, and simultaneous, high-priority status in-house emails, which must be acknowledged by each customer service employee. Access to customer data is password-protected and limited to internal access only. MotherNature.com conducts reviews of its web security no less than quarterly. 

**TRUSTe**

TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this web site has agreed to notify you of: 

**1.** What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the web site   
**2.** The organization collecting the information   
**3.** How the information is used

**Credit Card Fraud Protection**  
All major credit card companies protect cardholders against fraud, subject to a $50 deductible. MotherNature.com will protect you for this $50 portion in the highly unlikely situation that you ever encounter an inappropriate charge involving our company.

**Optional Phone Ordering**  
If you are still skeptical about placing your order online, you may place your order over the phone at (800) 517-9020 or via fax at (877) 355-1144 during customer service hours: Monday through Friday from 9am-9pm EST; closed Saturday and Sunday.

**Information We Collect**  
In designing our website, we started with the simple belief that customer service is our number one priority. Therefore the customer information we collect is used to enhance our services to you, our customer.

Specific areas from which we collect data include: 

  * **Membership.** Prior to checking out, we ask our customers to become a Mothernature.com Member. To ensure easy shopping and timely product delivery we ask for shipping information including your email address and phone number so we can quickly communicate with you about the status of your order. Additionally, we ask for limited demographic information including your birth-date and gender, which enables us to continually update our site to better meet the needs of our members. Should you wish to change your membership information, simply click on [Your Account](https://web.archive.org/asp/membership.asp) or call our customer service department at (800) 517-9020 or (978) 929-1300; Fax (877) 355-1144, Monday through Friday, 9am-9pm EST; closed Saturday & Sunday. Please also note that while we can make your account inactive and ensure that MotherNature.com in the future does not contact you, due to our quality control practices, we cannot delete member files. 
  * **E-mail newsletters.** We give our members the option to sign up for our weekly newsletter. This service is meant to better assist you to make informed decisions about your health, as well as the health of your family and friends. To sign you up we simply need an e-mail address. Subscriptions can be canceled at any time. In addition, you may unsubscribe to any of the free personalized e-mail services you have chosen at any time, without any future correspondence or questions. Please send your comments and complaints to [newsletter@mothernature.com](mailto:newsletter@mothernature.com). If you do not wish to receive product and health information updates from us, simply send an email with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line of the message. 
  * **Purchases.** When you order from MotherNature.com, we ask for your name, address, and credit card - all of which are necessary for purchase and delivery. To protect our members, we use Netscape's Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt the information you send us when you place your order, as described above in "Our Secure Ordering." 
  * **Create An Account.** Customers creating an account at MotherNature.com are asked to provide their name, address, email address, and phone number. They are also asked for the year of their birth so that MotherNature.com can determine whether they are 13 years of age or older as described in our "Parental Consent" section. Customers are asked to choose a password. 
  * **Ask An Expert.** Customers submitting a question to one of our health experts are asked to include their name, email address, city, and age. MotherNature.com never prints the full name of questioners on the site. 
  * **My MotherNature.** This section, which is only available to users who have become members of our site, includes convenient features to facilitate the consumer's shopping experience. A password is required to use My MotherNature. See the "Membership" section for more information about the data collected when a customer creates an account. 
    1. **My Account** is where the user may edit and update information submitted when he or she became a member of MotherNature.com. 
    2. **My Orders** is a complete list of all past and current orders placed by the customer; it also includes tracking numbers for packages, plus the ability for the customer to name, reorder, or cancel any order. 
    3. **My Shopping List** automatically maintains a list of items purchased by the member in the past, making it easier to locate and reorder favorite products. 
    4. **My Subscriptions** allows the user to subscribe or unsubscribe to MotherNature.com's Health Journal, Super Sunday Specials mailing, and other promotional mailings. 
    5. **My Address Book** allows the user to set multiple shipping addresses and give a nickname to each one for easy reference when checking out. This is useful when sending a gift to a friend or family member, for instance. 
    6. **My Supplement Planner** invites the customer to answer yes/no questions about her or his health and lifestyle to help us build a personalized list of recommended supplements. 



**Personal Shopping Accounts**  


[](https://web.archive.org/asp/personal.asp)

This service is intended to make shopping easier for you. Our experienced [Personal Shopper](https://web.archive.org/asp/personal.asp) can identify products that meet your needs, based on the information you provide. Only a licensed medical practitioner can diagnose health conditions and prescribe remedies. However, our Personal Shopper is able to identify and pick products commonly associated with specific needs, such as high cholesterol, prostate care, menstrual health, viral immunity, and bone density. Our Personal Shopper will place the products he or she recommends into a shopping cart for you. You will then be free to review the cart's contents and to remove or add to your order as you wish. 

You may choose at any time whether or not to take advantage of the service or the products our Personal Shopper suggests.

**Cookies**  
Our cookies, which are small pieces of information that are stored by the web browser on a computer's hard drive, help us facilitate customers' visits to MotherNature.com. Cookies tell us when a user is a repeat visitor to our site, and let us know how he or she found us. They also allow us to automatically link our customers to their personalized accounts, including shopping baskets and Personal Shopping Accounts. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies. Please check your browser's guidelines should you wish to reject cookies. A visitor who chooses to reject the cookie may still view our site's extensive content, such as our Encyclopedia, Health Journal, and Rodale books online; however, he or she will not be able to make a purchase, nor use the **My MotherNature** feature for members. Our cookies link to a member's identification number, which does not include any personally identifiable information.

**Parental Consent**  
Our privacy policy prohibits us from accepting members who are under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 are free to explore our site, but should they wish to become members or make a purchase we require that they do so through their parents' account. Should you have additional questions or concerns, please contact our customer service department at [CustomerService@MotherNature.com](mailto:customerservice@mothernature.com).

**Log on Files**   
MotherNature.com automatically logs IP addresses and session sources (e.g., if the user came from an affiliate's site). We do not log the ISP or the browser type. The information is not logged to personally identifying information, nor to the member's identification number. MotherNature.com uses these logs for sales and marketing tracking as well as system performance monitoring. These logs are reviewed for the overall, aggregate trends they reveal about our customers, not for the behaviors of individual users. 

**Sharing of Information**   
MotherNature.com protects account information against unauthorized access or release. We will not give, sell, rent, or loan any identifiable personal information to any third party, unless the customer has authorized us to or we are legally required to do so. Additionally, we do not share the buying habits of individual consumers. We may share aggregate customer data with our Wellness Advisors and with selected manufacturers and advertising partners. In some cases, MotherNature.com provides the email addresses of our current customers to direct email companies working on our behalf. In this way, these companies can appropriately direct our promotional mailings to the correct customers (e.g., to prevent duplicate promotions). Promotional emails only go out to customers who have indicated they wish to receive them and customers may elect at any time not to receive any further emails. 

**Third Party Intermediaries**   
To complete credit card transactions, MotherNature.com provides the following member information—using secure communications—to CyberSource, the intermediary credit card processing company we use: name, billing address, credit card number, expiration date, and the amount of the transaction. MotherNature.com shares shipping information with intermediary shipping companies including but not limited to UPS, USPS, Airborne Express, and DHL. 

**Notification of Changes**   
In the event that MotherNature.com should change its privacy practices or start using member information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we would send email to our members notifying them of the changes, explaining the reasons and allowing them the opportunity to accept the changed policy, or demand exemption from it.
