**Privacy Policy**

**Use and storage of your personal information.**

At **askamum.com** we collect different types of information about our users for three main reasons:

  1. To help us to improve the services we offer. 
  2. To provide personalised services unique to individual users. 
  3. To use anonymous details about our users to sell appropriate advertising space on the site. This might mean showing an advertiser how many users we have on the site; it does not mean sharing an individual's details with an advertiser. Where we collect registration information from an individual, we will never share that individual's information with a third party, including an advertiser, without that user's explicit permission.



**Our principles**

We are acommitted to protecting your privacy. Our policy can be summarised in one sentence: we will not share your information with others without your prior consent. We have also established the following four principles:

  1. We will continue to invest in high-quality security and do our utmost to protect user privacy through the appropriate use of the latest security technology. 
  2. We will respect your email privacy. You will not receive unsolicited mail from motherandbabymagazine.com/or from third parties screened by motherandbabymagazine.com unless you have agreed to this. We will, however, mail you occasionally with information about your registration and/or your subscription account. 
  3. We will not pass on any individual user details (including your email address) unless we have your prior consent. 
  4. Otherwise, we will only share anonymous aggregate statistics about our users, sales and traffic patterns with our advertisers.



Should we elect to change our privacy policy we will post the changes here. Where the changes are significant, we may also choose to email all our registered users with the new details.

**Using your data**

When you supply any personal information to **askamum.com** we have legal obligations towards you in the way we use those data. We must collect the information fairly, that is, we must explain how we will use it and tell you if we want to pass the information on to anyone else.

In general, any information you provide to the **askamum.com** will only be used by **askamum.com** and by its agents and service providers. Your information will be disclosed where we are obliged or permitted by law. Also, if you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to **askamum.com** or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on **askamum.com** , we can use whatever information that is available to it about you to stop such behaviour. This may involve informing relevant third parties such as your employer, school e-mail/Internet provider and law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.

**Holding personal information**

We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the service you have requested, and remove it in the event that the purpose has been met. For safety reasons, however, **askamum.com** may store messaging transcript data (including message content, member names, times and dates) for a period of six months. Where personal information is held for people who are not yet registered but have taken part in other **askamum.com** (e.g. competitions), that information will be held as long as is necessary to ensure that the service is run smoothly. We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

**Contacting you**

If you are notified on **askamum.com** that your information may be used to allow **askamum.com** to contact you for "service administration purposes", this means that we may contact you for a number of purposes related to the service you have signed up for. For example, we may wish to provide you with password reminders or notify you that the particular service has been suspended for maintenance. We will not contact you for promotional purposes, such as notifying you of improvements to the service or new services on **askamum.com** unless you specifically agree to be contacted for such purposes at the time you submit your information on the site, or at a later time if you sign up specifically to receive such promotional information.
