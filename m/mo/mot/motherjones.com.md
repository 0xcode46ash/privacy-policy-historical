# Our Privacy Policy

  


The following policy is applicable to: 

Foundation For National Progress  
222 Sutter StreetÂ Suite 600  
San Francisco, CA 94108 

The non-profit Foundation for National Progress -- which operates Mother Jones magazine and MotherJones.com -- respects our customers' right to privacy. When we collect information about our users, subscribers, and other customers, we make every effort to give them the option to "opt out" of providing such data. However, we feel strongly that choosing to share some data with us will help make your experience at MotherJones.com and other interactions with the Foundation of National Progress more pleasant and successful for you, and will help us continue to provide outstanding investigative journalism and photography. 

Most of the information we collect on our website is aggregated to track general patterns such as browser and platform usage and overall traffic patterns. We use address, telephone, and e-mail information primarily to deliver items you request, such as magazines, weekly e-mail newsletters, items purchased from our store, or fine photography catalogs. 

Upon request, we provide our users, including subscribers to the magazine, with access to any and all information (including proprietary information) that we maintain about them. Users may access and/or correct this information, or have themselves removed from any shared list, by contacting us by postal mail, or, in the case of disputed charges, through your financial institutions. 

**Cookies:** MotherJones.com sets cookies to spare users the irritation of seeing the same pop-up ads repeatedly in the same visit. These cookies do not record your domain name, or your e-mail address or any personal information about you or your Web-viewing habits. Cookies are used consistently in two areas of the site. Our discussion software, [Web Crossing](http://webcrossing.com/) uses cookies to recognize logged-in users and to track their settings and preferences. The [Mother Jones Market](http://market.motherjones.com/), our online store, uses cookies to track users.  


The [Mother Jones Market](http://market.motherjones.com/) is operated through a partnership between Yahoo! Stores and MotherJones.com; as a condition of service, the Mother Jones Market utilizes cookies to track users and associate them with the purchases that they intend to make. The privacy policy for the Mother Jones Market can be found [here](http://market.motherjones.com/info.html). 

**Security:** When sending or receiving sensitive information such as credit card numbers, we automatically direct users to a secure transaction server. 

**Advertising:** We feature advertising banners on our website hosted by third party servers. Some of the servers used by our advertising partners may use cookies to track your "click-stream" (your viewing and/or purchasing behavior). Any data they collect is separate from that collected by MotherJones.com. To determine what, if any data our advertising networks may collect, examine their privacy policies.
