The non-profit Foundation for National Progress -- which operates Mother Jones magazine and MotherJones.com -- respects our customers' right to privacy. When we collect information about our users, subscribers, and other customers, we make every effort to give them the option to "opt out" of providing such data. However, we feel strongly that choosing to share some data with us will help make your experience at MotherJones.com and other interactions with the Foundation of National Progress more pleasant and successful for you, and will help us continue to provide outstanding investigative journalism and photography. 

Most of the information we collect on our website is aggregated to track general patterns such as browser and platform usage and overall traffic patterns. We use address, telephone, and e-mail information primarily to deliver items you request, such as magazines, weekly e-mail newsletters, items purchased from our store, or fine photography catalogs. 

Upon request, we provide our users, including subscribers to the magazine, with access to any and all information (including proprietary information) that we maintain about them. Users may access and/or correct this information, or have themselves removed from any shared list, by contacting us by postal or electronic mail, or, in the case of disputed charges, through your financial institutions.
