The non-profit Foundation to National Progress -- which operates Mother Jones Magazine, the MoJo Wire, and the International Fund for Documentary Photography -- respect our customers' right to privacy. When we collect information about our users, subscribers, and other customers, we make every effort to give them the option to "opt out" of providing such data. However, we feel strongly that choosing to share some data with us will help make your experience at motherjones.com and other interactions with the Foundation more pleasant and successful ones for you, and will help us continue to provide outstanding journalism and photography through our special projects. 

Most of the information we collect on our website is aggregated to track general patterns such as browser and platform statistics and overall traffic patterns. We use address, telephone, and e-mail information primarily to deliver items you request, such as magazines, weekly e-mail newsletters, items purchased from our store, or fine photography catalogs. 

Upon request, we provide our users, including subscribers to the magazine, with access to any and all information (including proprietary information) that we maintain about them. Users may access and/or correct this information, or have yourself removed from any shared list, by contacting us by postal or electronic or (in the case of disputed charges) through your financial institutions.
