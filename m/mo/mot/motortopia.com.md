# Privacy Policy | Motortopia

**Effective August 18, 2008**

Motortopia.com is an online service that allows you to set up your individual personal profile that can be linked together through networks of your friends. After you join Motortopia.com, you can view others' profiles and communicate with friends. You can also meet new friends on the service, share photos, post blogs and comments, and talk about your interests.

At Motortopia.com nothing is more important than your online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at [support@newdigitalgroup.com](mailto:support@newdigitalgroup.com).

## Information Collection and Use by Motortopia.com

Motortopia.com collects user submitted information such as name and email address to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the Motortopia.com service. Motortopia.com also collects other profile data including but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, and location in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other.

Motortopia.com also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.

User Profile information including members' pictures and first names are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the Motortopia.com social networking community. Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join Motortopia.com, to add others to your network of friends, and to send notifications related to the service. Unless you insert your email address in a public blog or a message entry viewable by the public, Motortopia.com does not provide anyone's email address to anyone else. Unless you put your full name in as a public display name, your full name will not be displayed by Motortopia.com to the public. To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the service, Motortopia.com allows users to search for other members using first and last name, email address, and schools and/or companies where users may have attended or worked.

We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service, or cost saving offers from our sponsors and advertisers. Users may choose not to receive this email.

From time to time, Motortopia.com or a partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstakes or contest on Motortopia.com. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.

## Invitations and Other Communications

In Motortopia.com you can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. Motortopia.com stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the friend's list of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations. Motortopia.com does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. Recipients of invitations from Motortopia.com may contact Motortopia.com to request the removal of their information from our database.

## Use of Cookies

If we do use cookies, we will not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies. Advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Motortopia.com Privacy Policy.

On occasion, we may work with an advertiser or partner to run a promotion, contest, or other program where you may be asked additional information, which information may be shared with the promotion or contest sponsor; but only when we receive verification for the advertiser or sponsor that the information is only for follow up communication from that advertiser or sponsor and not to further sell or rent your private information.
