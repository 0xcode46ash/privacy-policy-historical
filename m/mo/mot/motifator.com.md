####  Information we collect and why 

Forums on KEYFAX websites are all register-to-post. Registration asks for your name, address, and email address, with voluntary fields concerning applicable instruments or software that you own. The act of Registration not only deters posts of an offense nature, it allows us to deliver a superior level of customer service by way of keeping you posted with information that relates to the equipment you use. 

If you do not wish to be contacted with product and services information our email correspondence contains opt-out link that will remove you from this database. 

If you are making a purchase through one of the KEYFAX on-line stores your credit card information, and contact telephone number will also be required. This information is only acquired via our Secure Server (Thwate) and does not reside in our database. 

We may also analyze technical information about how you view one of our websites including, but not limited to, IP address, operating system, browser, and individual pages viewed, routing, and how long your visit lasted. 

We also employ a standard web technology ("cookies") to streamline your viewing experience, whether browsing a forum, or making a purchase on one of the e-stores. 

For instance ‘enabling' your cookies lets you re-visit a forum from your home computer and for your login and password to be recalled automatically.
