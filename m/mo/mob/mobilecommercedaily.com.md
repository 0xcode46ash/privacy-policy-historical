# Revised: Napean LLC's privacy policy - Mobile Commerce Daily

**NAPEAN**

**Mobile Marketer and Mobile Commerce Daily Privacy Policy  
**Mobile Marketer and Mobile Commerce Daily are publications of Napean LLC. This privacy policy represents our steadfast commitment to combine the highest quality news, analysis, information, service and products with the utmost degree of integrity in dealing with visitors to our Web sites, blogs and newsletters. This policy governs how we collect, store and use information about our visitors. It will be continuously reexamined with the advent of new technologies, new business practices and the changing needs of our visitors.

Our sites collect no personally identifying information except when that information is knowingly provided by you, such as when you request a product or service that requires registration or billing information. This information also enables us to improve your Web site experience and to refine and customize your experience on our sites.

Occasionally, we may also ask for information in polls and surveys to enable us to provide the services and/or products you request and to better meet your needs and preferences. At such times, we will inform you as to why we are collecting this information, and we will explain how it is being used.  
We will take appropriate measures to ensure the security and privacy of any personally identifiable information that we collect.

We will provide appropriate mechanisms for you to review and correct, upon request, any personally identifiable information that we collect from you. To ensure the integrity of the request, we will require that it be made in a manner that can be verified.

From time to time we may share personally identifiable information with companies or organizations that we believe might have a product or service of interest to you. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to outside individuals and/or companies who help us: bring you the products and services we offer; create, operate, and maintain the Web site(s); and with specialized services such as payment processing, shipping, mail and email distribution, mobile messaging, Web site(s) hosting, monitoring, analytics, sweepstakes and promotions management, survey and mobile payment processing. However, we will offer you the opportunity to “opt-out” of having this information shared with third parties that are not affiliated with Napean LLC by writing to us at help@mobilemarketer.com.

We may disclose your personally identifiable information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with law enforcement investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Web site(s), to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of the Web site(s) or the public. In addition, if and when we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or a financing, investment, support or funding, sharing or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets shared or transferred. If we engage in any of these types of transactions, your personally identifiable information will be subject to our privacy policy in effect at the time of the transfer or sharing of such information.

We may place “cookies” in the browser file of your computer. A cookie does not contain permanently identifying personal information. It is used to provide an enhanced user experience, making your navigation through our sites easier by saving your passwords, purchases and preferences while you are at our sites.

Cookies also show how visitors use our sites and enable us to make improvements based on actual visitor traffic patterns. The use of cookies in this manner is an industry standard.

This privacy policy may be revised from time to time, and you are urged to review it periodically.

**Terms of service**  
Use of this site constitutes agreement to the following terms of service:

Furthermore, Napean LLC assumes no liability for your use of a service or product purchased or obtained from an area of this site or from a “co-branded” site operated by a company or person not directly affiliated with Napean LLC. In such areas or sites you may be asked to provide certain information, including credit card or other payment mechanism. You agree not to hold Napean LLC responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as a result of your dealings with third parties who operate these areas or co-branded sites.
