9\. _**COLLECTION AND USE OF END USER ANALYTICS INFORMATION**_. The Platform provides information to you about how your End Users use their mobile applications as well as how applications are performing across different mobile devices (but the Platform does not collect personally identifiable information about your End Users). HasOffers obtains this information either directly from our Customers (typically with the use of advertising links) or from our Software Development Kit (“SDK”) if embedded by you in an End User's mobile application. 

The data collected by our SDK may include: agent version, platform, SDK version, timestamp, API key (identifier for application), application version, device identifier—e.g., MAC address, Android ID, and IFA—Model (non-iOS), manufacture (non-iOS) and OS version of device (non-iOS), session start/stop time, locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), time zone, and network status (WiFi, etc.). The device identifiers may be hashed. In addition, HasOffers may collect the following data if you select the option for HasOffers to collect and provide such data to HasOffers: anonymous User ID, latitude and longitude (obfuscated by HasOffers for iOS to state/city), events, errors, and page views. Finally, we see the IP address of the user through the HTTP request. HasOffers uses this data to create reports for you to analyze your End Users and to create reports and/or metrics against which you can compare your user base. We may provide you with the option of exporting raw HasOffers data to your servers such as timestamp, platform, event, and user ID. You can also record errors that occur in your applications and receive an export of data containing the error information. 

Your End User data is presented to you to analyze your applications. In addition, HasOffers may provide you with aggregated and anonymous benchmark data that includes your End User data and all other Customers' End User data. **But while HasOffers assists you with the organization and collection of End User data, HasOffers specifically disclaims ownership of this data. The End User data stored by our servers belongs exclusively to our Customers and may be deleted any time at their request.**

10\. _**CUSTOMER USE OF END USER DATA**_. HasOffers is not responsible for any use by you of any data about your End Users, even if HasOffers helped you collect the data. You should allow End Users to review your policies to understand your use of End User data. You are prohibited from using the Platform, Services, or Website to independently collect any personally identifiable information about any End User. Further, you must provide a privacy agreement to your End Users in which written notice is given to the End Users that they may opt out of HasOffers Analytics tracking by going to our End User Opt-Out page at <https://www.optoutmobile.com/optout>. 

In the event that you are aware, or should be aware of, the potential for users of your Subscription website to access such from any European Union state, you agree to comply with the 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council Directive, commonly known as the “EU Cookie Directive”, that requires websites to obtain informed consent from internet users before storing information on such internet users’ computers or any web-connected devices. Further, you agree to amend your privacy policy as necessary to maintain compliance with any supplemental laws, regulations or directives that may be enacted from time to time by legislative bodies and that may pertain to your use of the Services and your Subscription website. 

11\. _**END USER OPT-OUT PROVISION**_. Your End Users can opt-out of HasOffers Analytics tracking and personalized ads/recommendations from HasOffers by clicking going to our End User Opt-Out Page at <https://www.optoutmobile.com/optout>. 

The opt-out is specific to MobileAppTracking’s activities and does not affect the activities of other ad networks or analytics providers that you use. If an End User opts-out, HasOffers will stop tracking data for that device identifier going forward. The HasOffers Analytics tracking will stop across all applications. HasOffers will stop providing recommendations to the device identifier across all publishers. 

There may be a short delay of up to several business days while the request is being verified, processed, and deployed across our system.
