### **DEFINITIONS**

**Advertiser:** An Advertiser is any person or company that promotes their product or a component of their product using the MAT Platform. For example, Advertisers may promote their mobile application, a specific promotion within their app, an app update, or a company announcement, and use MAT to attribute these events.

**Attribution:** Attribution is a general term used to describe the process user interactions within apps and around the advertising ecosystem are measured. For example, a user may click on an advertisement, download an app, and make an in-app purchase - each of these actions would be considered an Attribution within the MAT Platform

**Unique Advertising Identifiers:** Unique Advertising Identifiers are user-specific, unique character strings for advertising that can be reset by the user. Examples of Unique Advertising Identifiers include IDFA (developed by Apple for the iPhone), Google Ad ID (developed by Google for Android), and Windows advertising ID (developed by Microsoft for the Windows Phone). Additional information is available [here](http://support.mobileapptracking.com/entries/22541461-Unique-Identifiers-for-Attribution "Unique Identifiers for Attribution").

**Geographic Location Data:** Advertiser clients may collect Geographic Location Data from an IP address through the Platform to give them deeper insight into the performance of their advertising campaigns. Geographic Location data is non precise geographic data that determines location from IP address, GPS coordinates and/or Wi-Fi networks.

**Mobile App Tracking ("MAT"):** MobileAppTracking is a back-end technology that provides unique attribution matching using advertising identifiers and/or statistical identifiers to measure the performance of a mobile ad campaign.

**MAT SDK:** The MAT SDK is computer code inserted into a Developer’s mobile app to enable the Developer to collect Unique Advertising Identifiers and Statistical Identifiers from the user for the purpose of measuring performance.

**Partners:** Partners are third parties that Advertiser clients work with to promote applications, networks, offers, and/or advertisements, including but not limited to: ad networks, publishers, advertisers, affiliates, analytics providers, and data providers.

**Postbacks:** Postbacks are server-to-server communications that allow parties to share information.

**Statistical Identifiers:** Statistical Identifiers are used to provide attribution when Unique Advertising Identifiers are unavailable. Statistical Identification involves the collection of publicly-available HTTP headers from the end user’s device. MAT uses the HTTP headers to probabilistically determine which device is responsible for the Attribution and collects the following data points: country code, device brand, device model, device carrier, IP address, language preference, operating system name, operating system version, user agent (browser type), and timestamp. As such data points frequently change over time, statistical identifiers collected for Attribution are set by default within the MAT system to a 24 hour window. This window cannot be changed. Additional information is available [here](http://support.mobileapptracking.com/entries/21771055-Device-Fingerprinting-Methodology "Device Fingerprinting Methodology").

### **WHAT DATA DO ADVERTISERS COLLECT FROM END USERS WITH MAT?**

The MAT Platform is designed to collect and use data such as Unique Advertising Identifiers, Statistical Identifiers, Geographic Location Data and other data provided by the Advertiser for attribution. When an end user clicks on an advertisement, installs an app, or takes an action inside of an app, the MAT Platform uses the MAT SDK and redirect links to collect information, such as a Unique Advertising Identifier, to perform attribution. The Platform also enables clients to view and measure information provided by TUNE, Advertisers, and the Advertiser’s other partnerships. Advertiser clients and Partners may also send information to the MAT Platform via Postback.

The Platform does not collect names, addresses, phone numbers, or financial information (like credit cards or banking information) from end users. 

### **FOR WHAT PURPOSES CAN CLIENTS USE DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE MAT PLATFORM?**

Advertiser clients use information collected from end users on the MAT Platform to view reports and data related to their advertising campaigns. The Platform also allows clients to view and utilize the collected information they collect to optimize their ad campaigns. Advertiser clients may also use the MAT Platform to share their data with Partners—including measurement partners, ad networks, and publishers—via Postback, data exports, and/or API calls.

Advertiser clients may use the information they collect on the MAT Platform for the following purposes:

  * Measuring the performance of ad campaigns (for example, by comparing the lifetime value of a user against the expenses required to obtain that user).
  * Measuring the value of particular end users.
  * Measuring the performance of various Partners, including ad networks and publishers.
  * Creating customized performance reports (for example, how well a particular advertisement is performing in a particular geographic region).
  * Determining when end users respond to ads.
  * Cross device attribution. For more details on how MAT measures cross device attribution, [click here](http://support.mobileapptracking.com/entries/30513204-Measuring-Cross-Device-Attribution).



Advertiser clients own the data that they provide to and collect through the MAT Platform, including end user data. When clients remove or export their data from the MAT Platform, their use of data is governed by their own privacy policies and applicable laws, rules, or regulations.

### **WHAT DATA DOES TUNE COLLECT FROM CLIENTS?**

Signing up as a MAT client requires the submission of your full name, mailing and/or billing address, email address, company name, and website URL. This information is not collected from end users except in rare circumstances when an Advertiser asks MAT to collect email addresses on their behalf. We use this information to service your accounts and respond to inquiries. We hold all such information in strict confidence.

### **IN WHICH INSTANCES DOES TUNE SHARE DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES?**

TUNE may provide, or enable others to collect, information for purposes of detecting and preventing malicious activity or invalid traffic. TUNE may disclose such information in the event we reasonably suspect malicious activity or invalid traffic, or believe that we are legally required to do so. TUNE may also share aggregated data derived from the MAT Platform, including, for example, statistics about Platform activity. Finally, we may transfer MAT Platform data to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.

### **CAN END USERS OPT OUT OF THE MAT PLATFORM?**

End Users can opt out of the MAT Platform by visiting our opt out page and following the instructions available at www.optoutmobile.com. Opting out of MAT will not stop end users from receiving interest-based advertisements from our clients or other publishers or ad networks. Users who want to opt out of a particular ad network, publisher, or advertiser’s ads must contact those companies directly to opt out.

### **HOW IS THE INFORMATION STORED AND RETAINED ON THE MAT PLATFORM?**

TUNE allows advertiser clients to choose how long data is stored in the MAT Platform. Clients are able to create and manage custom data-retention policies that dictate when data is removed from the MAT Platform (e.g. after 180 days). When the client does not select a custom data-retention policy, TUNE uses industry standard data-retention policies. 

### **SECURITY**

We use reasonable efforts including a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.

### **WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT IS CHANGED?**

TUNE may find it necessary to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please check this Privacy Policy, as any changes will be posted on this site. 

### **MORE QUESTIONS?**

If you have questions about privacy on the Platform, you may send us a message at [privacy@tune.com](mailto:privacy@tune.com "Email privacy@tune.com").
