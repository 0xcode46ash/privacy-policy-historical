 **Web browser cookies**  
Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance Users' experience. A User's web browser places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them. Users may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert them when cookies are being sent, but this may result in some parts of the Site not functioning properly.

 **How we use collected information**  
MobyMax may collect and use Users' personal information for either improving the User’s experience or sending periodic emails.

If the User decides to opt-in to our email alerts, they will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. If at any time the User would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

 **Property and control of student data**  
All pupil records and data continue to be the property of and under the control of the local educational agency. Pupils are able to access, print, and otherwise retain any pupil-generated content by accessing it through various channels in their student accounts. 

**How we protect your information**  
We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our Site. 

**Sharing your personal information**  
We do not sell, trade, or rent Users' personal identification information to others. We will not allow unrelated third parties to use your personal information for marketing without your consent.

We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners for the purposes outlined above.

We may disclose and share personal information with (1) our group companies or any entity which acquires any part of our business, (2) with our service providers (including, for example, suppliers who develop or host our sites), (3) with single sign-on providers that you use to access our software, (4) rostering services that you use to update your student and teacher rosters, and (5) if required or permitted by law with other third parties with your consent.

 **Procedure for unauthorized records disclosure**  
In the event of a breach or unauthorized disclosure of student records that would be subject to disclosure under applicable federal or state law has occurred, MobyMax will take prompt and appropriate steps to mitigate further breach or release of student records, provide notice to the affected User promptly and without reasonable delay, and work with the affected User to provide information and assistance necessary to comply with any notification to parents, legal guardians, or students, as is required by applicable law.     

**Contract termination/completion**  
Following expiration or termination of the agreement under which the USer purchased access to the MobyMax web-based products or services, and upon receipt of written request from the User, MobyMax will destroy or, if agreed, return to the User, the Student Records in its possession within a commercially reasonable period of time. For clarity, data generated by MobyMax or our products that is in aggregate, or that is annonymized (i.e., personally identifiable information has been removed) may be retained by MobyMax and used for product improvement purposes.
