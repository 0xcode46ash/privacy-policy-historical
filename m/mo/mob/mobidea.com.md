# Privacy Policy - Mobidea

## Privacy Policy Statement

We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our dedication to respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy sets out our practices with respect to personal information collected from visitors to the Site as well as registered affiliates (collectively referred to as "you"). This Site operates an affiliate program and is solely restricted to adults who are capable of entering into contractual relationships. Any persons under the age of eighteen are strictly prohibited from using this Site or signing up for an account with our affiliate program. We do not intentionally collect information on individuals under the age of eighteen. By visiting this Site and/or signing up for an affiliate account, you agree and consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time, as well as the Mobidea Terms and Conditions also located on this Site.

## What Information is Collected:

## Personal Information

We collect personal information that is voluntarily provided to us via the registration form for our affiliate program. This information may include, but not be limited to, the affiliateâ€™s name, physical address, phone number, email address, instant messenger address, payment method information (such as bank account information), password, and on occasion a unique identifier (such as their mother's maiden name). If an affiliate sends any personal communication or correspondence, by any means, to the Site, or any of its employees, agents or representatives, the Site may collect any information regarding that communication and include that information in its customer database.

## Non-Personal Information and Cookies

Certain non-personal information may be collected from visitors to this Site including, but not limited to, their browser type, browser language, operating system, IP address, and the domain name from which they accessed the Site. Other non-personal information may be collected such as browsing behavior, date and time of visit, the pages visited, the time spent viewing the Site, the number of times the visitor returns to the Site, and click- stream data. We do not track any information about visitors once they leave our Site. We may use cookies to collect this information. We may also allow unaffiliated third parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies to visitors of our Site. You are always free to decline cookies, but in doing so they may not be able to use certain features on our Site.

## Use of Information

We collect personal information so that we may custom tailor the web experience for each affiliate and offer the best products and services to meet the needs of each affiliate.

We may use information collected from visitors to our Site for any of the following purposes: (1) to send affiliates information and promotional materials about our company, which will not continue if opted out of, (2) to send affiliates limited and only occasional information and promotional materials from our marketing partners and third parties, (3) to deliver highly targeted but very limited display advertisements and offers by email, which will not continue if opted out of, (4) to contact affiliates to our Site when necessary, (5) to allow one-click purchases or access to proprietary content by pre-populating fields, within registration or other transaction screens, with a visitor's name, billing address, all as provided by that visitor, (6) to help diagnose problems with our server, (7) to administer our Site, (8) to conduct internal reviews of our Site (e.g., to determine the number of visitors to the Site), (9) to help us better understand visitors' use of our Site, and (10) to protect the security or integrity of our Site.

Since part of the personal information that is collected and safeguarded by us is your email address, we try very hard to respect your time and privacy by controlling and limiting the frequency of mailings. If you receive a mailing from us or one of our marketing partners, it is because your email address is either listed with us as someone who has expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving information in the future, or you have registered or purchased or otherwise have an existing relationship with us. Your registration for our affiliate program is your consent to these occasional mailing.

There may be occasions when you will be presented with special offers either from us or from third-party service or content providers, which may include communications, newsletters, commercial advertising, or other promotional or special event materials (collectively referred to as "Offers"). Your consent to this Privacy Policy acts as your consent to receive these occasional mailings by us and by our third party service or content providers.

The Site is not responsible or liable for the use of any information that an affiliate may provide, or that is gathered by third-party websites that have ads or links on the Site. This Site does not control, monitor or endorse the information gathering practices or Privacy Policies of any of those third-party websites. Whenever applicable, each affiliate should seek to read the Privacy Policy of any third-party website provider that has an advertising banner, advertises or has a link on the Site or in an email.

If you have received unsolicited email sent via this system or purporting to be sent via this system, please forward a copy of that email with your comments to [abuse@mobidea.com](mailto:abuse@mobidea.com).

We take unwanted email complaints very seriously and maintain an opt-out system to assist you in removing your name from our mailing.

## Removing your name off our list

If you wish to be removed off of our mailing list, please send us an email to [abuse@mobidea.com](mailto:abuse@mobidea.com) and we will gladly remove you.

## Security

This Site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. For all other information, visitors and affiliates should consider this communication and information to be non-confidential, and consequently, we assume no responsibility or liability if any information relating to any visitor or subscriber is intercepted and/or used by an unintended recipient.

## Acceptance of these Terms

By visiting or registering to become an affiliate, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. We may at any time revise or amend any of these terms and conditions without notice. You are bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically visit this page to review the then-current terms and conditions to which you are bound. To the extent that any of the third-party sites accessible through our Site (such as our advertisers) have different privacy practices from those stated in this Privacy Policy, those third-party privacy practices govern the collection and use of information you provide when visiting those sites. We are not responsible for the policies, content, and practices of other companies which may collect personal information as a third-party web service provider that has an advertising banner or link on the Site.
