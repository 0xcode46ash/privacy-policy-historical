This message board will store a few details about you while you are using the message board. The board administrator takes all reasonable steps to ensure that no unauthorised access to the information is granted. The following information is collected. 

  * **Cookies -** The message board software will set the following cookies: 
    * **Membername** : This is so the board can 'remember' your username when using the message board.
    * **Password** : This is so you don't have to re-tpye in your password everytime you wish to make a post or use any of the member only features on the board.
    * **Last Visit Data** : So that you can be made aware of any new posts since your last visit, two cookies are stored. One called 'templastvisit', the other 'lastvisit'. These only store data in a numerical format.
  * **IP address** \- When you register and when you make a post - your IP address is stored on our server. This protects you as a member and us as a company when identifying that the user who posted is indeed authentic. This information will only be used if you misuse any features on the board or in any dispute. The board administrator is able to ban by IP address. IP addresses may also be used to track user activity that we deem sketchy in order to keep spamming/hacking to a minimum.



**Registration Form** \- The registration process is designed so that you can keep a unique identity. The only required parts to the registration process is the 'Member name' and 'E-mail address'. There is an option to keep this email address private if you wish. The message board administrator will take all reasonable measures to ensure that any information you provide confidentially is kept confidential. You may change this information at any time by editing your profile. 

**Postings**  
The board administrator(s) cannot be held responsible for the content of posted messages on the forums.
