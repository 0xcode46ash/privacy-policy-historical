# Cookie Policy - Mobile World Congress

## What is a Cookie?

‘Cookies’ are small text files that websites may place on your computer, mobile device or tablet. We use ‘cookies’ and similar technological capabilities, including web beacons (collectively, “Cookies”) to remember what you have done on one of our websites (“Sites” or “Site”) in order to improve your browsing experience, to help remember log-ins, or to provide advertising while visiting a Site.

## What is a Web Beacon?

Web beacons are images embedded in a web page. We use web beacons to see which of our email messages are opened or forwarded so we can better understand what types of email messages our customers are interested in and how we can improve our communication with our customers.

## Our Policy is Simple.

We **ONLY** use Cookies to deliver a smooth experience to our Site visitors and to understand how visitors use our Sites. We do this because we want you to have a great experience browsing our Sites, so we can provide you with relevant content and so that we can continually improve the service we provide you. 

This means that we **DON’T** use Cookies to identify you personally as a user of our Sites, and we **DON’T** use Cookies to target you with advertising.

You can decide whether to accept or reject Cookies from us – it’s your choice.

## Why Do We Use Them?

We use different types of Cookies for different functions.

Some Cookies allow you to stay logged in while you browse our Site. If you didn’t have a Cookie for this purpose, you would need to log in every time you loaded a different page from our Site. We think this would be a very annoying experience.

Cookies help us identify which of our articles, discussions, videos or documents are the most popular and what type of journey a visitor has through our Sites. After all, we don’t want to spend a lot of time publishing things no one is interested in.

We place a Cookie when you visit a page on which we show an advertisement. This helps us to collect anonymous information about how frequently advertisements are clicked and to understand how interesting and attractive our advertisements are. We don’t share this information with third parties.

A list of all the Cookies we use, along with our advertising network and technology partners can be found in our Cookie list at the bottom of this page.

## Do You Have a Choice Over the Use of Cookies?

Yes. There are a number of options available. You can set your browser either to reject all Cookies, to only allow “trusted” sites to set them, or to accept only those Cookies from those sites which you are using at that moment.

## Some of the Functionality of Our Website Will Be Lost If You Delete All Cookies.

All of the ‘popular’ browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. These settings are usually found in the ‘options’ or ‘preferences’ menu of your browser. To help you better understand these settings, the following links may be helpful to you, otherwise you should use the ‘Help’ option in your browser for more details.
