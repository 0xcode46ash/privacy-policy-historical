## Privacy Philosophy

  
Mobilefish.com hates spam, junk mail, and unwanted advertisements just as much as you. What i am saying is that i know what it's like and consider spam a horrible way to promote a website and would therefore never do it myself or help any other site to do it. In fact i recommend you to join project [Honey Pot](http://www.projecthoneypot.org/?rf=43013) to identify spammers and the spambots they use to scrape addresses from websites.
