# Mobilefish.com - Information about privacy policy.

Cookies.  
Mobilefish.com is using cookies. These cookies are used to customize your visit to the site and for other purposes to make your visit more convenient or to enable me to enhance my service.

Contact Forms.  
Mobilefish.com contact forms require users to give contact information (like their name and email). The contact information from these forms is ONLY used to get in touch with the users when necessary. I do not rent, sell, share or in any way give your personal information to anyone. I will not use your email address to send you unwanted advertisements.

Your IP address will be logged in order to prevent misuse of the contact form.

External Links.  
This site contains links to other sites. Mobilefish.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.

Entering Data.  
Mobilefish.com provides several services where web visitors are allowed to enter personal or sensitive information. I do not store, collect, rent, sell, share or in any way give your personal information to anyone. Files created by these services will be available only for a few hours and will be automatically deleted.

Privacy Philosophy.  
I hate spam, junk mail, and unwanted advertisements just as much as you. What I am saying is that I know what it's like and consider spam a horrible way to promote a website and would therefore never do it myself or help any other site to do it. In fact I recommend you to join project [Honey Pot](http://www.projecthoneypot.org/?rf=43013) to identify spammers and the spambots they use to scrape addresses from websites.
