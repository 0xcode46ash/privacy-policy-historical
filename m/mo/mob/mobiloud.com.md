# MobiLoud - Privacy policy

Fifty Pixels Ltd (“ **50pixels** ”) operates several websites and services including [mobiloud.com](http://mobiloud.com/). It is 50pixels’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, 50pixels collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. 50pixels’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how 50pixels’s visitors use its websites. From time to time, 50pixels may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

50pixels also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on its blogs.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to 50pixels’s websites choose to interact with 50pixels in ways that require 50pixels to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that 50pixels gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a demo at [mobiloud.com](http://mobiloud.com/) to provide their name and email address for us to provide a demonstration of their app. Those who engage in transactions with 50pixels – by purchasing access to the MobiLoud services, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, 50pixels collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with 50pixels. 50pixels does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it will prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities, like receiving a demo or purchasing any of our services.

### Aggregated Statistics

50pixels may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. However, 50pixels does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

50pixels discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on 50pixels’s behalf or to provide services available at 50pixels’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using 50pixels’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. 50pixels will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, 50pixels discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when 50pixels believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of 50pixels, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an 50pixels website and have supplied your email address, 50pixels may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new services, features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with 50pixels and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. 50pixels takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Third party services

50pixels uses a number of third party services to analyze and take action on the data you provide, with the intention of improving our services and providing a better customer experience, these include: Intercom for customer support, Google Analytics, Woopra and MixPanel for visitor and user analytics, Profitwell for dunning emails, MailChimp and Drip for email newsletters, Facebook and Google Adwords's pixels for advertising and conversion tracking, Perfect Audience for retargeting, LeadDyno and FirstPromoter for our affiliate program. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. 50pixels uses cookies to help 50pixels identify and track visitors, their usage of 50pixels websites, and their website access preferences. 50pixels visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using 50pixels’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of 50pixels’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Business Transfers

If 50pixels, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that 50pixels goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of 50pixels may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, 50pixels may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in 50pixels’s sole discretion. 50pixels encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
