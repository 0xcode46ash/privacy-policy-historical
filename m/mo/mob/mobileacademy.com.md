# Privacy Policy – Mobile Academy

Mobile Academy, its subsidiaries, related parties and affiliates respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our commitments and your rights concerning your personal information. You should read the Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Sites or Services. The Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Service and governs the same Services and Sites as the ones in the Terms of Service. Any terms we use in the Privacy Policy without defining them have the same definition given to them in the Terms of Service.

###### Personal information

We may collect personal information from you in a variety of ways, including but not limited to your browsing activity when visiting our Sites. You may be asked for your name, email address and phone number. You may, however, visit our Sites anonymously.

Our Sites may use “cookies” to enhance your experience. A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your device’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information. You may choose to set your web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that some parts of the Sites or Service may not function properly.

###### How we protect your information

* * *

We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our Sites. Sensitive and private data exchange between the Sites and you happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures. Because we operate internationally, the personal information may be transferred to and made available in other countries than your country of residence. Also in these countries we take all reasonable care to protect your personal information.

###### Advertising

Advertisements appearing on our Sites may be delivered to you by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the advertising partners to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile non personal information about you or others who use your device. This information allows advertising networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover any third party internet sites that you can access through our Sites nor the use of cookies by any advertising partner.

###### Your consent

By using the Sites or any of our Services, you expressly consent to our collection and use of your personal information and non-personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Also you consent to any transfer of personal information and non-personal information outside your country.
