This statement of privacy (this “ ** _Statement_** ”) explains our data collection through our website and related services and products (collectively the “ ** _Site_** ”) and the use of such data, so please read the entire Statement.  Use of the Site indicates a site user’s acceptance of this Statement.

**Changes:**  
We may change this Statement from time to time in our sole discretion.  Accordingly, we encourage site users to review this Statement periodically.  We reserve the right (but are not required) to send a notice via email or any other delivery method of any such change to this Statement.  The most current version of this Statement will be linked on the Site.  If a user continues to use the Site after we change this Statement, then user accepts all such changes.

**Collecting Site User Information:**  
We collect information about site users in two ways:  (1) when users give the information to us or when users give us permission to obtain the information and (2) when users access and/or use the Site.  All information that we collect about a user is defined as “ ** _Collected Information_**.”

The following list, which is not meant to be exhaustive, provides examples of when we obtain Collected Information and the type of Collected Information obtained:  
            (a)        When establishing and maintaining a user account, which may result in our obtaining user name, email address, and other registration and profile information;  
            (b)        When establishing and maintaining user purchases, which may result in our obtaining user credit card information, billing address, and other financial records;  
            (c)        When customizing the content users see, access, and/or use as part of the Site, which may result in our obtaining, with user permission, access to user information in or through other third party services;  
            (d)        When providing user access to, and use of, the Site through a personal computer or other device, which may result in our obtaining the following automatically recorded information (collectively the “ ** _Log Data_** ”):  (1) user Internet Protocol address, (2) the address of the web page visited before user came to the Site, (3) user browser type and settings, (4) the date and time of any request user makes to the Site, (5) how user used the Site during user’s visit, (6) user type of personal computer or other device, (7) the operating system and other software on a user’s personal computer or other device, (8) the settings on a user’s personal computer or other device, (9) a user’s geo-coordinates and other location data and geo-targeting data, and (10) other information provided by tracking technologies, such as cookies (as described in more detail below);  
            (e)        When contacting user regarding the Site, when reviewing or processing a questionnaire user submits for or through the Site, or when reviewing or processing a user request for a product or service offered by or through the Site, which, in any such case, may result in our obtaining information that user discloses or submits; or  
            (f)         When user participates in any survey, sweepstakes, contest, or promotion by or through the Site, which may result in our obtaining user’s name, profile photo, email address, and other registration and profile information.  
All Collected Information falls into one of two categories:  (1) “ ** _Identifiable Information_** ” or (2) “ ** _Unlimited-Use Information_**.”  Identifiable Information is limited to information that can be used to specifically identify user as a unique person.  Unlimited-Use Information is all Collected Information other than Identifiable Information.

_Identifiable Information_

**Cookies:**  
In order to make certain parts of the Site function correctly, cookies are utilized.  A cookie is a small data file transferred by a website to user computer’s hard drive.  The Site sends cookies when (among other occasions) user visits, makes a purchase, requests or personalizes information, or registers for the Site.  A cookie cannot read personal data off a user’s hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites; the only Identifiable Information a cookie can contain is information a user supplies.  Although user can still browse and search for products on the Site, user must have cookies enabled in order to add items to user’s shopping cart or to create/log into a My Mouser account.
