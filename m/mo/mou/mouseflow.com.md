This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by Mouseflow when you access the Sites and Mouseflow Service (including through the websites of our partners), how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Service. The use of information collected through our Sites shall be limited to the purposes under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service to customers.

  1. Information We Collect.

We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by such companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. Our partners may also use such technologies to deliver advertisements to you as described below. While we respect the privacy of our users, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals set by your browser at this time. We use cookies to remember users’ settings as well as for authentication and analytics. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.
