**This website and the technologies used to protect orders on it are double protected through both Thwarte and Stronghold security systems, and verified through third party GeoTrust certification. When you place an online order over the Internet with Mountain Rose Herbs, the connection that transmits your data is secure through SSL 128 bit encryption technology.**

## Our Security Policy

Since 1987 we have NEVER sold or traded any of our customers information, nor have we ever jeopardized that information.  
Usually, when most of us order online, all of our personal information; most importantly our credit card information is stored on the company's website server or Internet connected server. Here it can reside for months and even years, ripe for the opportunity of theft. Mountain Rose Herbs does not employ this practice.  
Immediately after you place an online order with Mountain Rose Herbs, only a small handful of authorized employees have access to your order and they will promptly print out your order for further processing in our offices. Following this they completely delete it from the server immediately. We do not let your information sit idly on a server, and no part of your personal or financial information is ever stored on any computer with an outside connection to a publicly accessible network (internet).  
All hard copy orders that have been printed, processed and shipped are further filed in a secure and protected environment, then burned after a predetermined time.  
The website that you buy from may not be the only security threat to be concerned about. Many companies contract third parties or outside credit card processing services. Here your financial data is sent through a rather dubious line and processed by an organization that may not have the same security ethics as the company you bought from. We DO NOT contract our credit card processing services to any outside organization. It is all done within our own facilities by our own staff.  
  
## Our Privacy Policy

Since 1987 Mountain Rose Herbs has never sacrificed our customer's personal information for the purpose of extending marketing relationships with outside firms. We have never sold, traded, or rented our mailing list or customer information, and for this amount of dedication to our customer's privacy, Mountain Rose Herbs received an honorable national award in 1995 for holding such a formidable business practice. With regards to your online privacy we only collect 4 specific pieces of information......

  * When you subscribe to any of our e-mail communications or newsletters, your e-mail address will be stored on a third party server. You may completely remove your name from this by un-subscribing at anytime

  * If you checkout through our online shopping cart through the use of an account which you have previously setup, our systems will retain only your shipping and billing particulars through the use of cookies and this information is saved only through your instruction.

  * When you add items to your shopping cart a "product identifier" cookie is placed on your computer to remember the items added to your cart so when you come back at a later time they will still be there.

  * We monitor our web logs by employing the use of "stat counters" which assist us in determining possible page incompatibilities, dead links, the most useful pages to our customers, and to help us create richer content. We do not store information about YOU but rather we track information on the performance of our website, and the only identifiable information recorded is your computers IP address. This tool is solely used to help us improve the content of the site.




**Our promise to you is that we will never sell, dissect, decimate, share, or trade your information. We do not research your buying habits, we do not sell your buying habits, and most of all we do not transfer your online purchasing and personal information onto any other machine. Everything you have given us stays with us......period.**
