# Morningstar Canada - Privacy Policy

**What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?**  
When registering for the free areas of the site, or signing up for 

any other paid service, you will be asked to complete a registration form that requests personal information. Some examples of personal information that we request include names, addresses, and demographic information like age and income level. When you subscribe to any paid service on Morningstar.ca or purchase any products on our Internet site, we also need credit card information. 

We use your name, address, and e-mail address to contact you about Morningstar.ca and to send you information about other Morningstar products. We also offer some well-screened partners the opportunity to share information about products and services that we think might be of interest to you. You can choose during the registration process whether to receive this information from Morningstar and our partners. Details on how to control the use of your information are found below. 

The demographic and user profile information that we collect, such as household income, age, and gender, are used only in aggregate. We do not use any demographic information for individual members. We share this aggregate information with our advertisers and use it to enhance the site by creating content and functionality that best serves the needs and interests of our membership. 

**How Is Financial Information Used and Protected?**   
We recognize that your financial information is very sensitive, and protecting the privacy of this information is a top priority for us. 

_We do not use your portfolio information in any way._

The income demographics that we share with advertisers are aggregated from the registration forms; that is, they are not used on the individual level. The portfolios entered by Morningstar.ca users are not collected or analyzed. 

**What About Cookies?**   
Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on your computer's hard drive for recordkeeping purposes. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers. Cookies do not identify users personally; instead, they identify a user's computer. By allowing us to monitor the traffic on Morningstar.ca, cookies help us to provide our audience with the information and tools that will be most useful. Usage information may also be used to target advertising so customers view the most relevant ads. 

Of course, you can choose not to accept the cookie by adjusting your browser settings, but note that if you do, you may not be able to take full advantage of the customized content

. 

Morningstar.ca does contain links to other sites and ads that may contain cookies. In the same way that we can not be responsible for the privacy practices of these sites, we cannot control their use of cookies. 

**Security**   
We use industry-standard security measures, such as encryption and authentication, to protect your credit card information. While we make every effort to protect your personal information, no transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure. 

**How to Control or Change Your Profile Information**   
During the registration process, you are given the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from either Morningstar or other companies that Morningstar carefully selects. You can change this preference at any time by [editing your Personal Profile](https://web.archive.org/web/20011024125147id_/http%3A//www.morningstar.ca/personalize/membership.asp) in the Membership section of the site. 

You can also change or edit any information you've provided in your registration and Personal Profile by visiting the Personal Profile section of the Membership area. Since this information is password protected, you may be required to enter your user name and password to make any changes. 

Every time we send you an e-mail communication, information on how to stop receiving e-mail from Morningstar.ca is included. You can stop mail from Morningstar.ca by sending an e-mail message to [ nomail@morningstar.ca](mailto:nomail@mail.morningstar.ca). Any changes to our policy concerning the use of your information will be posted in the Membership area of the site. 

If you have further questions about this Morningstar.ca's privacy practices or this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [ mailto:webmaster@morningstar.ca](mailto:webmaster@morningstar.ca)
