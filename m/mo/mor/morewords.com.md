# More Words - Privacy and Cookies Policy

I take the privacy of visitors to this website seriously. I don't collect any personally identifiable information. If you provide your email address to me (for example if you fill out the comment form) I'll only use that email address to reply to you, and I won't pass it on to any third parties. 

I allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit this web site. They may use non-personally identifiable information (such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.

These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. If you're in the European Union (and some nearby places) you'll receive a message about accepting cookies the first time you visit this site. In that case, cookies won't be sent until you've agreed to accept cookies. To learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit [networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). 

I use cookies to count the number of pages you've seen, and to record your preference for no advertising. If you delete or don't accept cookies, neither of those features will work. 

I may use server log files, and third-party statistical services, to help analyse how you find and use the site. I don't (and can't) use the logs or statistical services to track or to collect any personally identifiable information about you. 

If you've any questions about this policy, please write to me using the [contact](https://web.archive.org/mwc.html) link.
