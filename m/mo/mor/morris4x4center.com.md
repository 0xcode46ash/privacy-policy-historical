# Privacy Policy - Morris 4x4 Center

## Here at Morris 4x4 Center, we go the extra mile to ensure that your on-line experience with us is enjoyable, secure and private.

  


**Browsing our Site**   
Morris 4x4 Center obtains some basic information when you visit [www.jeep4x4center.com](http://www.jeep4x4center.com/) to improve the quality of your experience. The information that we obtain depends upon where you travel within our site. Anytime that you visit our site to browse, read or download information, we obtain and store the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet (for example, msn.com, aol.com, etc.); the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to areas of our site, and to help us make our site more useful and interesting to our visitors. 

  


**Cookies**   
Morris 4x4 Center uses "cookies" on our site to enable you to save your Jeep information and to expedite any future orders. A "cookie" is a small text file that a website can place on your computer's hard drive in order, for example, to collect information about your activities on the site or to make it possible for you to use an online "shopping cart" to keep track of items you wish to purchase. The cookie transmits this information back to the Web site's computer, which, generally speaking, is the only computer that can read it. Most consumers do not know that "cookies" are being placed on their computers when they visit websites. If you want to know when this happens, or to prevent it from happening, you can set your browser to warn you when a website attempts to place a "cookie" on your computer. Our site relies upon the use of cookies to enhance your shopping experience, but our cookies do not contain nor track your personally identifiable information. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to our website. You may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the [Google advertising opt-out page](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html) or by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative opt out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). You may opt out of our use of Google Analytics by visiting the [Google Analytics Opt-out page](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). 

  


**Product Purchases**   
If you choose to purchase a product from us, we will collect your personally identifiable information, such as your name, e-mail address, billing postal address, shipping postal address, telephone number, credit card number and expiration date ("Purchase Information") in order to properly process your purchase. You may not modify or remove your Purchase Information - even if you cancel or return your product order - as it is necessary to maintain a record of your initial product purchase.   
**Note:** These policies may be updated periodically; we invite you to review this page whenever you are visiting our site. 

  


**E-Mail Newsletter Registration Request**   
If you choose to provide more information to us through our e-mail registration, we will periodically send you newsletters in which you will find special offers, new product announcements and other related information. Your registration information will enable us to provide you information regarding future products and services that may suit your particular interests. You may "opt-out" of our e-mail newsletter at any time by calling us at 1-877-553-5337. 

We do NOT sell, trade or share our e-mail list with any other person or organization.   
**Note:** Our e-mail accounts are hosted by our sister site [www.cyberjeep.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120510114558id_/http%3A//www.jeep4x4center.com/popup/www.cyberjeep.com). 

  


**Email Tracking - Web Site Navigational Information**   


Emailvision uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Company’s Web sites ("Web Site Navigational Information"). This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information the Company may collect and how the Company may use this information.

**Email Cookies**

Emailvision uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company’s Web sites, Emailvision’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Emailvision, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a "Contact" or a "Free Campaign Commander™ Demo" Web form), you remain anonymous to the Company. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based.

Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. If you have chosen to identify yourself to Emailvision, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Service, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed in your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Service and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Service.

Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. Emailvision uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Company’s Web sites. When you purchase the Service or provide the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places on your Web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s Web sites, but you will not be able to successfully use the Service.

Emailvision may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with Data About Emailvision Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Service.
