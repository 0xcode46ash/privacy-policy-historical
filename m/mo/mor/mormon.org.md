Privacy Policy

The Web site owner, Corporation of the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is sensitive to the privacy of Internet users who visit this site. The following frequently asked questions will help you understand our privacy policy: 

**Do I have to give personal information about myself in order to view the site?**  
No. You can visit the site without telling us who you are or giving other personal information. If you choose to request a free video or book, you will be asked to provide your name and address in order for the item to be delivered. We regard this information as confidential and use it only for the purpose of sending you the item and verifying that you received the item. The provision of name, address, e-mail address, or other personal information is purely voluntary.

**What are “cookies?” Do you use them?**  
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your browser when you visit a Web site. A cookie does not identify you personally; it simply identifies your browser and tracks the settings, preferences, or features you choose on a particular site. When you return to the site, your browser sends the cookie to the Web server. A cookie is not harmful to your computer in any way. It cannot be used to spread viruses, nor can it read your hard drive to obtain personal information about you. It is a text file that you can delete at any time. 

In our continuing efforts to improve users’ site experience, we use cookies to help us provide pages and features that are most compatible with your browser and that match your preferences. 

**Do you log user IP addresses?**  
Yes. When users request pages from this site our servers log their current IP address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer whenever it accesses the Internet. As with other logging devices, information gathered in this manner may be used to improve site administration.

**Do you use statistical tracking software to record the activity of site visitors?**  
Yes. The Church has contracted with Omniture, a third party Web service provider, to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from our site. Omniture collects general summaries of site activities and does not collect personal information from our visitors. This statistical information is owned by the Church and is used only to improve the site’s quality. 

**If I ask a question, will you put my name on an e-mail list?**  
No, not unless you specifically request to be placed on a mailing list. You may at any time request correction of your e-mail address, or removal of your e-mail address from our list. All such e-mail offers provide a simple means by which you can request removal of your e-mail address from our list. 

**If I request a free offer will you put my name on an e-mail list?**  
Yes. We occasionally send e-mails to announce additional free offers. All such e-mail offers provide a simple means by which you can request removal of your e-mail address from our list.

**If I send or receive an online greeting card, will my e-mail address be stored and used for other purposes?**  
No. The e-mail addresses of both the sender and the recipient are deleted as soon as the card is sent. Where European or other local data privacy law so requires, before providing personal information about anyone other than yourself, you will obtain the other person’s consent and provide that person access to this Privacy Policy.

**Do you sell personal information gathered on this site to other organizations?**  
No.

**Do you collect personal information from children?**  
As suggested by the Child Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Children under 18 are advised to obtain permission from their parents before they send any information about themselves or others.

**How do you protect personal information provided by visitors?**  
This site has industry-standard security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration of the information under our control. However, because no security measures are foolproof, we cannot guarantee that information will not be lost or misused. 

**Where are you located, and how may I contact you if I have further questions?**  
Questions concerning this Policy may be sent via e-mail to: [DataPrivacyOfficer@ldschurch.org ](mailto:DataPrivacyOfficer@ldschurch.org). This Web site originates from the United States of America; and shall be governed solely by the laws of the United States.

**Please check this privacy policy frequently to view changes. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this privacy policy at any time.**
