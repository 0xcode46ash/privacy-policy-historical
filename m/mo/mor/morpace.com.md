**Research Survey Information**   
Personal information provided to Morpace is confidential. Information collected is combined with information gathered from other survey participants and shown in aggregate excluding personally identifiable information, unless otherwise evident within the survey. If we indicate that personal information may be included in the research findings, we ensure that the information is treated with the strictest of confidence. We will not mislead a participant regarding the nature of the research or how the information will be used. Please see the section titled "Disclosure of Personal Information by Morpace" and "Access to Morpace data" for more information.

Research participation is voluntary. Participants may opt-out of current research by disregarding or declining the invitation to participate and are given the opportunity to be removed from future research conducted by Morpace. At a research participant’s request, we will correct, amend or delete incorrect personal information we have collected about them. Such access may be limited by Morpace if providing such access would violate another person’s rights.

  Morpace is a member of the Council of Insights Association, the professional trade association of survey research companies and holds individual membership to European Society of Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR). Morpace adheres to the mandated Insights Association Code of Standards and Ethics for Survey Research. This code includes requirements for the protection of personal information and respondent identifying information.

**Morpace Survey Web Site**   
The only personal information actively collected by Morpace is that which is voluntarily provided. Like many other websites, we use cookies to provide a better experience for our members. We limit their use for quality control and validation. Cookies are used temporarily during the time you are actively completing a survey or filling out the registration forms and we do not store or retain your cookie information in any way. No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is transmitted via these cookies.

Personal information is safeguarded on secured systems and is used only for the purpose stated. In order to respond to an inquiry, an email address or other contact information may be requested when we are contacted through [[information@morpace.com](mailto:information@morpace.com).](mailto:information@morpace.com.) This information is shared with Morpace employees on a need to know basis only.

Our survey web site may contain hyperlinks to web sites outside of Morpace. Data collection privacy policies may be different on hyperlinked sites not owned by Morpace Inc.; therefore we recommend that the Privacy Policy / Statement is read for each site visited.

Participants consent to the terms of the Morpace Privacy Policy and the use of their information is received upon entering the Morpace survey web site.

**Email Addresses and Communication**   
Morpace may have personal email addresses in its email system or data files that are acquired through:

  * Requests for information submitted to our web site
  * Emails sent to Morpace
  * Research surveys completed for Morpace
  * Clients who have provided email addresses for research purposes



The CAN SPAM Act of 2003 applies specifically to commercial emails sent for the purpose of sales or direct marketing. Morpace does not fall into this category; however, it voluntarily observes the CAN SPAM Act requirements that can be applied to survey research. Morpace uses email as a means of communicating to known clients and customers. When email is used to invite respondents to participate in surveys, the following processes are used to ensure we do not send spam:

  * We clearly identify ourselves and/or the client when sending an invitation
  * We provide contact information should there be any questions or concerns
  * We provide the option to be removed from future email research invitations
  * We reuse email addresses only as a legitimate follow up to survey research



These processes ensure that we contact only those who could have an expectation of being contacted for research purposes.

**Disclosure of Personal Information by Morpace  
** Morpace will not disclose any individual’s personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or if Morpace is required or permitted by law, national security or court orders to collect, use, and / or disclose personal information; notice may not be required.

In the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or acquisition of Morpace or a Morpace business or business unit, the acquiring party would agree to be bound by the terms of the Morpace Privacy Policy before any information would be transferred.

Personal information may also be disclosed when the survey instrument clearly states that the information will be disclosed or, when a participant makes a request during the survey that can only be fulfilled by disclosing information from the survey. Morpace discloses personal data only to third parties who reasonably need to know such data only for the scope of the market research and not for any other purposes. Third parties are required to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles and such recipients must agree to abide by confidentiality obligations.

**Access to Morpace Data**  
Only authorized Morpace employees, vendors, contractors or partners carrying out authorized business functions are allowed to access Morpace data or databases.

Vendors, contractors, or partners who have access to survey information in connection with providing services for Morpace are required, at a minimum, to sign a Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement requires them to keep the information confidential; they are not permitted to use this information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Morpace. Third parties are required to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles and such recipients must agree to abide by these principles.

Morpace employees are required to sign a Confidentiality Agreement in which they agree to keep all project and respondent personal information confidential. Employees who violate the Confidentiality Agreement are subject to disciplinary actions, including termination when appropriate.

**Personal Information Security**  
Morpace is committed to keeping personal data secure and will take all reasonable precautions to protect personal information from loss, misuse or alteration. This data is stored on our internal network servers that are protected by firewalls and other appropriate security mechanisms.

Morpace adheres to the safeguards required by the Security Standards as established under HIPAA as it relates to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI), as well as to all Protected Health Information (PHI).

**Children's Privacy**  
Morpace does not knowingly make direct contact with children to participate in research activities. If we require survey information from children, we contact the parent or guardian to arrange the survey activities and we encourage the parent or guardian to closely monitor and participate in the survey activities.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**  
Morpace reserves the right to modify and update this policy and its related business practices at any time. Please view this Privacy Policy on a regular basis.
