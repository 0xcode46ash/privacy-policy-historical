Detailed Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy discloses the general privacy practices for www.mocoloco.com.

While visiting these web sites (collectively, the "Site"), we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") for purposes of interacting with the Site. To further the protection of your Personal Information, MoCoLoco has adopted a set of information management guidelines, outlined below, that serve as the basis for our customer and advertiser relationships.

Affiliate Marketing

MoCoLoco is a marketing program affiliate with several brand name online retailers (such as Amazon), this is done either directly with the retailer or via a third-party provider of affiliate marketing programs. Neither the third-party providers, nor the retailers, share personally identifiable information with MoCoLoco. The information provided is generic in nature; type of product sold and date of sale for example. The information provided is not sold, shared, nor rented to any third party, and is used internally only.

Surveys

MoCoLoco may periodically request information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. MoCoLoco uses a third-party web-based survey provider to compile the surveys. Information requested in the surveys is broad demographic information (such as zip code, age level) for aggregate use and does not in any way identify the user. Survey information is not sold or rented to any third party, and is used internally by MoCoLoco for purposes of improving the use and satisfaction of this Site.

These cookies are only for use on our website and do not affect your computer in any way.
