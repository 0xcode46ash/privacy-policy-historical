### 3\. Using your personal information

3.1 Personal information submitted on this website will be used for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy or in relevant parts of the website.

3.2 Information you enter into a product search or enquiry form may be:

(a)  shared with a third party so we are able to provide you with information about the products and/or services you requested. This may include introducing you to a broker who will either contact you direct to discuss your requirements or arrange for a qualified advisor to do so on their behalf. All the companies we work with are FCA regulated where relevant.

(b) stored internally and held against your money.co.uk profile if we detect you have a money.co.uk account.

3.3 If you enter a competition, we may use your personal information to manage any competition entries you submit, validate such competition entries, and send you any prizes you may win.

3.4 If you sign up for our comparison table email service, we may use your personal information to send you emails regarding the comparison tables you requested. If you give your consent, we may also provide this information to third parties to enable them to notify you of suitable products and services at the appropriate time.

3.5 If you sign up to receive our newsletters, we will use your personal information to send you the newsletter and manage your subscription.

3.6 We use Seopa Ltd's insurance aggregator, Quotezone, to generate quotes for car, home and travel insurance and they will:

a) collect your personal data, including some sensitive personal data, via the forms on our website. This data is collated using secure methods, stored by Seopa Ltd in their database and accessed by Quotezone to provide the comparison service.

b) use this data to generate insurance quotes from the insurers they partner with. Some insurers may carry out soft credit checks as part of this process and searches will be visible on your credit file as a quotation search only so will have no bearing on your credit score. If you buy a policy these searches may take place again when your policy is due for renewal.

c) they may search external sources (e.g. the edited electoral roll, county court judgments and bankruptcy registers if applicable) to check and assess your application for accuracy. Again, these searches may be recorded by credit agencies but will not affect your credit score.

d) if you choose to buy cover you will be giving the insurer permission to use your data to administer the contract and to contact you. Please check the insurer's privacy policy to make sure you understand what permission you are giving them to contact you and how they will do this.

3.7 If you use our credit card eligibility checker we will collect some personal information about you to provide you with meaningful results on your chance of acceptance based on your credit history. This will be used in the following ways:

a) it will be shared with the companies we partner with to monitor feedback and power this service. These include Trustpilot, HD Decisions and the credit reference agencies CallCredit Limited, Equifax Limited, and Experian Ltd. By using this tool, you are agreeing to your information being shared with these companies, but under no circumstances will these third parties use your details for their own marketing purposes.

b) it will be used to carry out a soft credit search; this will provide an indication of your eligibility for credit cards but should not affect your ability to get credit in the future. Soft credit checks are only visible to you on your credit report, they cannot be seen by other companies, it would only be used for fraud prevention purposes. We will show your eligibility as a percentage, for more information on how this works read our guide.

c) HD Decisions will pass the details you have entered to the credit reference agencies so they can provide you with accurate results. For further information about this please see our [terms and conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions.htm) and [HD Decisions terms and conditions.](https://web.archive.org/hdd-terms-and-conditions.htm)
