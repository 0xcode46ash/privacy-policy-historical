# Montgomery College Web Privacy Statement

Information security and individual privacy are a priority at Montgomery College. The College strives to protect the information that it collects and uses this information for College business purposes only. The following further details information processing practices used by Montgomery College to protect information and promote privacy. 

**Commitment to Individual Privacy**   
Montgomery College is committed to protecting the privacy and accuracy of confidential information submitted by employees, students, activity participants and visitors to our website. We do not actively share personal information gathered other than as specified in this statement. However, because Montgomery College is a public institution, some information collected from the Montgomery College website may be subject to disclosure under Maryland law. Thus, in some cases the College may be compelled by law to release information gathered from our Web servers. This may include, at a minimum, server log information, email messages sent to an individual identified on the website, and information collected from Web-based forms.

**Personally Identifiable Information Privacy**   
Personally Identifiable Information including financial information that may be provided during the admissions, registration, gifting, or employment processes is used solely for those purposes and is restricted and protected in accordance with College policy and procedure, relevant State and Federal laws and regulations, and by protected network and data storage technologies. Montgomery College does not sell or share non-public personally identifiable information or client lists with a third party, unless necessary to complete a transaction in the ordinary course of business, or as required by State or Federal law or regulation such as the Maryland Access to Public Records Act (Public Records Act) or the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Complete information on the handling of student records in accordance with FERPA may be found in the College's  [Student Cumulative Records](http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/verified/pnp/41003.doc) policy. Student questions can also be handled by calling the Montgomery College Response Center at 240-567-5000. 

 **Students and Consent**  
When you apply with us and later register as a student, you give us consent to process data about you as necessary for the proper administration of your student relationship with us.

**Information Automatically Logged by Official Montgomery College Websites**   
Official Montgomery College websites such as My MC, MontgomeryCollege.edu, WebCt, and MCInfonet reside on servers and technologies managed by Montgomery College's Office of Information Technology (OIT). These servers collect and log information according to industry standards in order to analyze usage of the website and to improve its design and usability. The information that is logged does not contain personal data about the user and is used only internally by Montgomery College. Logged information includes the user's IP address, browser, operating system, session date and time, and referring/exit web pages. 

**Special Notification with Respect to Children’s Privacy (Users Under the Age of 13)**   
In response to concerns about protecting children’s privacy online, Congress enacted the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which websites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:  request or knowingly collect personally identifiable information online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; or knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties.

**Children’s Activities and Programs  
** Some Montgomery College (MC) Websites present MC-sponsored information or activities that are specifically designed for children. However, the Websites are intended to be used only by adults to voluntarily share information online, so that a child who is under the age of 13 can participate in these activities (e.g., summer camps, classes, programs) or so that the child can receive information mailed or emailed from MC (newsletters, class schedules, recruitment information). When a parent or legal guardian voluntarily signs their child up for one of these programs, the parent may be asked to provide:

  * The child’s full name
  * Full home mailing address
  * Phone number
  * Birthdate
  * School, current grade level
  * Email address
  * Parent or legal guardian’s name and email address
  * Credit Card Information
  * Health and Emergency Information



All information provided by the parent/guardian is voluntary. MC, through its Websites, does not condition participation in any of our offered activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. This information will not be transferred, disclosed or shared with a third party except as reasonably necessary to implement and manage the activity, and will not be used for other purposes. The College reserves the right to make the determination as to what information is necessary for a particular activity.

The parent or legal guardian supplying the child’s information may be asked to acknowledge that they are, in fact, the parent or guardian who is legally authorized to disclose this information about the child. Parents or guardians have the right:

  * To review personal information that has been recorded by a MC Website about their child,
  * To refuse to allow further collection of the information,  

  * To be given the choice of consenting to the collection and internal use of information, but prohibiting the disclosure of that information to third parties (unless disclosure is integral to the site or service, in which case, this will be clearly stated), and
  * To require the deletion of any information that has been recorded.



**I** t is possible that a child under the age of 13 may have information entered without the consent of a parent or guardian. If MC is notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately delete the information from our servers at the request of the child’s parent or guardian.

**Information Collected by Email and Online Transactions  **   
If you send us an email, we will collect your email address and the contents of your message. We will use your email address and the information included in your message to respond to you, to address the issues you identify, and to improve this web site. We may also use your email address to notify you about updates, services, special events or activities offered by Montgomery College. We may redirect your email message or information you provided through an online transaction to a Montgomery College office other than the one which originally received the message or information in order to better respond to you. The information we collect is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video and graphic information formats included in the message or transaction. 

If you complete a transaction such as an online application or an information request form, we will collect the information, including personal information that you volunteered in completing the transaction. We will use this information only for the purposes for which the transaction was intended.

**Email Subscription/Opt Out**   
As a service, Montgomery College offers visitors the opportunity to subscribe to newsletters and other information.  If you choose to join, you will receive newsletters and/or information on the topics you choose.  You may unsubscribe at any time.  Any information you choose to provide may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Montgomery College.  Email addresses are never shared, rented or sold to third parties.   However, we may use cookies to track the pages on our site visited by subscribers to our email list. If you would prefer not to receive email or other communications from Montgomery College, contact us at [unsubscribe@montgomerycollege.edu](mailto:unsubscribe@montgomerycollege.edu).

**Surveys**   
Montgomery College may occasionally conduct online surveys of its user base, which may include both campus community members and users who are not directly affiliated with Montgomery College. 

As part of such surveys we may, with the user’s permission, collect personal and potentially identifying information. Any information gathered in this way is used for quantitative analysis of services, perceived qualities of the college, and users’ attitudes towards Montgomery College or its digital services. If such information is to be made available to other organizations or to be published, that fact will be made known to users prior to participation and their permission will be explicitly requested. 

Users can decline to participate if there is concern about the use of the collected information. Survey information will be released only in aggregate form, and not in connection with any identified individual user.

**Cookies  
** The College uses temporary cookies to maintain session continuity as the reader moves from page to page in a single session. These temporary cookies are deleted at the end of the session. Additionally, the College may use third party advertising companies to deliver College-related advertisements. These companies may use persistent cookies or other technologies (such as a 1×1 pixel .gif file, also known as a web beacon) to tailor advertisements the user sees on the website and third party websites, to track user response to advertisements, to report on visitor interaction and to measure the effectiveness of advertisements.

**Links to Other Sites**   
Montgomery College provides links to other websites. These links are provided as an information service only and are not intended nor do they constitute an endorsement by Montgomery College. When you leave an official Montgomery College website please be aware that Montgomery College is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites.

**Privacy Statement Updates**   
Periodically, this privacy statement may be updated to accommodate changes to our information security program or web environment.

**Who Can I Contact?**  
If you have any questions about how your personal information is used, or if you need further assistance, please contact the IT Policy Administrator ([itpa@montgomerycollege.edu](mailto:itpa@montgomerycollege.edu)).
