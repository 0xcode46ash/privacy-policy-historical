Privacy Practices**

Your privacy is important to MONEY2020.COM. This statement discloses the information practices for MONEY2020.COM Web sites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared.

**Personal information**

In general, you can visit MONEY2020.COM on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when we or our partners may need information from you.

You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address or e-mail id, to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you with a subscription. You may give us your credit card details to buy something from us or a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at MONEY2020.COM that you wish to be considered for. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so.

**Using and Sharing Personal Information**

The following paragraphs describe in more detail how MONEY2020.COM may use your personal information and with whom we may share it. Depending on the type of MONEY2020.COM Web site you are visiting, one or more of the paragraphs may apply.

**Fulfilling your Transaction Request**

If you request something from a MONEY2020.COM Web site, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information, with others, for instance, other parts of MONEY2020.COM, MONEY2020.COM's Business Partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal or government authorities (for example, Customs authorities) involved in fulfillment. In connection with a transaction we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.

**Marketing Use**

The information you provide to MONEY2020.COM on certain MONEY2020.COM Web sites may also be used by MONEY2020.COM and selected third parties for marketing purposes. Before we use it, however, we will offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used in this way.

If you participate in a MONEY2020.COM discussion forum or chat room, you should be aware that the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside MONEY2020.COM, who have access to that discussion forum or chat room. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. Each participant's opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of MONEY2020.COM.

**Other MONEY2020.COM Web Site Notices**

In some cases, specific MONEY2020.COM Web sites may contain other notices about their use and the information practices applicable to those sites.

**Our Worldwide Practices**

MONEY2020.COM is a global organization, with business processes and technical systems that cross borders.

Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information, all over the world.

We may share your personal information within MONEY2020.COM and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business.

Some countries may provide less legal protection for your information. In such countries MONEY2020.COM will still handle information in the manner we describe here.

**Information Security and Quality**

We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its quality. We implement appropriate measures and processes, such as using encryption when transmitting certain sensitive information, to help us to keep your information secure and to maintain its quality.

**Supplementing Information**

From time to time we may supplement information you give us via a MONEY2020.COM Web site with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information about businesses. This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide a better service.

**Use of Suppliers**

In some cases MONEY2020.COM uses suppliers to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is MONEY2020.COM's practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with MONEY2020.COM's policies.

**Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies**

We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on MONEY2020.COM Web sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." MONEY2020.COM or others on MONEY2020.COM's behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.

Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in an non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies.

We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some MONEY2020.COM pages use cookies, sent by MONEY2020.COM or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Web site. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work properly.

Some MONEY2020.COM Web sites also use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service. These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across MONEY2020.COM's Web sites. When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our suppliers. These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you don't want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies.

If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded. For more information, please see "How to work with Cookies".

**Service Quality Monitoring**

Certain Web transactions may also involve you calling us or our calling you. Please be aware that it is MONEY2020.COM's general practice to monitor and in some cases record such calls for staff training or quality assurance purposes.

**Personalized URL Link**

On occasion, we may personalize and customize Web sites for certain visitors. If you visit one of these sites, you may find it customized with references to products and/or services that we believe may be of interest to you, based on your previous interactions with MONEY2020.COM and information you have provided to us. While you are visiting these Web sites, we may collect information about your visit to better tailor the site to your interests. An invitation to visit one of these Web sites is usually presented as a personalized URL in an e-mail, a notice on a Web site registration page, or as a response to you logging on to a certain Web site.

If you choose to visit one of these Web sites, you are agreeing to let MONEY2020.COM collect information about your visits and also to its association with other information about you and your relationship with MONEY2020.COM. If you do not wish your information to be used in this way, do not accept the invitation to visit these sites.

**Disclosures Required By Law**

Please be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.

**Privacy Technology**

Technology will increasingly help give you more control over your personal information. It will also help organizations to manage their privacy practices and policies. As an information technology provider, MONEY2020.COM actively supports the development of privacy technologies to help achieve these goals and to help create greater trust and confidence in the way personal information is handled.

**Links to non-MONEY2020.COM Web sites**

MONEY2020.COM Web sites may contain links to other Web sites. MONEY2020.COM is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other Web sites.

**Privacy Questions and Access**
