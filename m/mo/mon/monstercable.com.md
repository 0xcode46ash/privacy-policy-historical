Effective Date: July 15, 2009

Monster Cable Products, Inc. and its corporate affiliates ("Monster" or "we") provide this Web Site Privacy Statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to respect your privacy. This Web Site Privacy Statement explains how we collect certain personal information at our Web Site at [www.monstercable.com](http://www.monstercable.com/) and any permutations thereof that directly link to this Website Privacy Statement ("Web Site"). This Web Site Privacy Statement also explains how we use and disclose such information – it does not, however, apply to our use of data that we collect otherwise (e.g., offline or through web sites of our foreign subsidiaries). If you do not agree with this Web Site Privacy Statement, please do not access or use our Web Site.

We generally reserve the right, however, to transfer any non-personal information without restrictions and to transfer Personal Information in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, and/or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.

**Children**  
Monster does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes, but because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of the Monster purchaser of the product, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy. If a child under 13 submits personal information to Monster and we learn that that personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will delete the information as soon as possible.

Our Web Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Monster is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites, and this Web Site Privacy Statement does not apply to such sites.

**Security**  
Monster endeavors to take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the security of our users' Personal Information. We do not, however, warrant or represent that your Personal Information is completely safe from hackers and other security threats. If you have questions about the security of this Web Site, please send an email to [webmaster@monstercable.com](mailto:webmaster@monstercable.com). 

**Changes to this Web Site Privacy Statement**  
If we decide to change this Web Site Privacy Statement – which we reserve the right to do, at any time, effective immediately – we will post the revised policy at this location, or at another location that is accessible via link from our homepage, so that users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it, on any given day. If at any point we decide to use Personal Information in a manner that is substantially different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will seek to notify users by way of an email, and provide users with a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. 

**Obtain and Modify Information**  
We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your Personal Information and try to keep information accurate and complete. Please contact us at [webmaster@monstercable.com](mailto:webmaster@monstercable.com) to find out if and what Personal Information we may have related to you. Also, if any of your Personal Information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), please let us know at [webmaster@monstercable.com](mailto:webmaster@monstercable.com). 

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at [webmaster@monstercable.com](mailto:webmaster@monstercable.com).
