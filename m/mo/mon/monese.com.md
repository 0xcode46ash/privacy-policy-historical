Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

  * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.

  * Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.

  * Where we share data with fraud and crime prevention agencies and fraud and/or criminal history checking service providers in the EEA, they may transfer your data outside of the EEA, in this case they impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that data to protect your personal data to the standard required in the EEA and/or they may require the recipient to subscribe to certain standards, intended to enable secure data sharing.




Please contact us at privacy@monese.com if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

We have put in place appropriate physical and technological security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.

**Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.

We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

**Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.

  * Follow your instructions

In relation to personal data processed by MasterCard, certain processors used by MasterCard are located outside of Europe. Personal data processed by MasterCard is subject to MasterCard Binding Corporate Rules, which you have enforcement rights under as a third-party beneficiary.

## Recipients (or categories of recipients) of personal information

PPS is committed to ensuring that your information is secure with us and with third parties who act on our behalf. These third parties include MasterCard, card manufacturers based inside/outside the EU, suppliers of identity validation services based inside and outside the EU, IVR and call recording (telephone) suppliers based inside and outside the EU and Monese Ltd.

We use safeguards to make sure that your information remains confidential and accurate and we may monitor or record calls, emails, text messages or other communications in order to protect you and us.

## Retention of personal information

We do not keep your personal data for longer than we need to, which in respect of your name, your Monese Card and Account details and records of transactions you have made or received is usually up to 7 years after the end of the relationship between us. We may delete some data upon termination of the contract such as records of communication to or from you, unless we are required to keep it for longer (for example due to a court order or investigation by law enforcement agencies or regulators, or due to any legal requirement we are subject to).

## Your Rights

You have certain legal rights to control what we do with your information, and see paragraph 10.5 for a summary of your legal rights.

## Your right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office

If you wish to raise a complaint on how we have handled your personal information, you can contact our Data Protection Officer. We hope that we can address any concerns you may have, but if we fail to address your complaint you can contact the Information Commissioner’s Office (<https://ico.org.uk/>).

## Financial crime prevention

PPS will use your personal data to help decide if your account(s) may be being used for fraud or money-laundering. We may detect that an account is being used in ways that fraudsters work or we may notice that an account is being used in a way that is unusual.

If we think there is a risk of fraud, we may stop activity on the accounts or refuse access to them. We might also check and share your information with fraud prevention agencies. If fraud is identified or suspected, these agencies may keep a record of that information and we may refuse to provide any further services to you. In addition, law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.

## If you choose not to give personal information

If you choose not to give us your personal information, it may mean that we cannot perform services needed to run your Monese Card. It could mean that we cancel your Monese Card or other services you have with us.

## 

Before we provide services, goods or financing to you, we undertake checks for the purposes of preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity. These checks require us to process personal data about you.

**WHAT WE PROCESS AND SHARE**

The personal data you have provided, we have collected from you, or we have received from third parties may include your:

  * name

  * date of birth

  * residential address and address history

  * contact details such as email address and telephone numbers

  * financial information

  * employment details

  * identifiers assigned to your computer or other internet connected device including your Internet Protocol (IP) address

  * vehicle details




When we and fraud prevention agencies process your personal data, we do so on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify identity, in order to protect our business and to comply with laws that apply to us. Such processing is also a contractual requirement of the services or financing you have requested.

We, and fraud prevention agencies, may also enable law enforcement agencies to access and use your personal data to detect, investigate and prevent crime.

Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal data for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to six years.

AUTOMATED DECISIONS

As part of the processing of your personal data, decisions may be made by automated means. This means we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if:

  * our processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with that of known fraudsters or money launderers; or is inconsistent with your previous submissions; or

  * you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity.




You have rights in relation to automated decision making: if you want to know more please contact us using the details above.

CONSEQUENCES OF PROCESSING

If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services and financing you have requested, or to employ you, or we may stop providing existing services to you.

A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us on the details above.

DATA TRANSFERS

Whenever fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area, they impose contractual obligations on the recipients of that data to protect your personal data to the standard required in the European Economic Area. They may also require the recipient to subscribe to ‘international frameworks’ intended to enable secure data sharing.

YOUR RIGHTS

Your personal data is protected by legal rights, which include your rights to:

  * object to our processing of your personal data;

  * request that your personal data is erased or corrected;

  * request access to your personal data.




For more information or to exercise your data protection rights please, please contact us using the contact details above.

If you are unhappy about how your personal data has been used please refer to our complaints policy. Complaints can be sent to: privacy@monese.com. You also have a right to complain to the Information Commissioner's Office (www.ico.org.uk) which regulates the processing of personal data.
