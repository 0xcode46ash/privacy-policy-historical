# moneyextra: Privacy of your information

**Privacy of your information**  
  


Your privacy is very important to us. 

Accordingly, we have put in place measures to ensure that any personal information or data that we obtain from you in connection with the MX Moneyextra website ("the website") are processed in accordance with the accepted principles of good information handling. 

**What data do we hold about you?**

We hold the personal information and data ("the data") provided by you during the voluntary registration process to tailor our service to your specific interests and requirements. We also hold the data provided by you in relation to certain services (such as the Portfolio Manager), so that you do not need to re-enter this data when you next require the service. Clearly, the more accurate the data we hold, the better our service will be. 

We only hold your data where you have been issued with a personalised user name and password. These are unique to each registered user. You should take great care of them and keep them safe at all times. 

**Where is your data stored?**

MX moneyextra and MX financial solutions are trading names of MX Moneyextra Financial Solutions Limited, which is the registered data controller for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998. 

All data provided by you are held securely and in confidence by us in our computerised records. You have a right to inspect the data we hold about you. If at anytime you wish to do so, you should write to our data protection compliance officer whose details are set out below. If anything in the data is inaccurate or out-of-date, let us know and we will amend our records. 

**How do we use your data?**

The nature of our service means that we share your data with partners who provide the products and services that you request. For instance, if you want to apply for a particular product or simply require more information about it, we will pass your relevant data to the product provider to fulfill your request. 

Occasionally, we may also contact you by phone, e-mail or otherwise to inform you about products and services which may be of interest to you. However, if you prefer to opt out of such "direct marketing" activity, please call our Contact Centre on 0845 6000 900, or let us know by any means convenient for you. However, please remember that by opting out, we will not be able to contact you about products or services that may benefit you. 

We also extract certain information from your data for the purpose of generating statistics but it is not possible to identify you from these statistics. 

**What are "cookies" and how do we use them?**

We assign an individual number or "cookie" to each registered user that is saved on your computer. The cookie cannot be read by any other websites and it lasts only for the duration of your visit to our website. 

We use cookies to personalise the service we offer to you. For instance, we can store your preferences for certain kinds of information or track your progress through the website. This helps us to improve our service to you and tells us which areas of the website are most relevant to you. 

**How do we keep your data secure and confidential?**

We use encryption and authentication procedures to protect your sensitive data. In addition, our staff has a personal responsibility for maintaining user confidentiality. We provide training and education to all our staff to remind them of their obligations, which are fully supported by our internal policies and procedures. 

We only pass data to third parties where the security and confidentiality of your data is assured. 

**E-mail**

E-mail addresses are required in order to register for some features on the website. Occasionally, we will send you special e-mail newsletters that contain the latest financial information and bulletins to keep you up-to-date with developments on the website. 

In each e-mail we send, there are normally instructions that allow you to "unsubscribe" to this service should you not wish to receive e-mails in the future. 

**Telephone Calls**

If you call our Contact Centre, we may record or monitor telephone conversations to provide additional security, resolve complaints and improve our service standards. Calls may also be monitored for staff training purposes. 

**Transfer of the website or MX moneyextra**

Notwithstanding anything else that has been agreed or represented (in this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use, or otherwise) if the website is transferred to another provider, we may transfer data obtained from you in connection with the website to the new provider. 

**Contact details**

Our data protection compliance officer is Alec Hughes and he can be contacted by writing to 33-34 Castle Street, High Wycombe, Bucks, HP13 6RU.
