PIEtech, Inc. (PIE), the developer of MoneyGuidePro and moneyguidepro.com, is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your information on our website.

Our Privacy Policy has three key elements.

  1. You were registered to use moneyguidepro.com by a financial advisor. This financial advisor and, if applicable, the firm with whom they are licensed, also has access to your personal information on moneyguidepro.com. Your advisor uses your personal information, in conjunction with our software, to provide customized financial planning reports for you. Your advisor's use of your data is governed by their firm's Privacy Policy. Please contact your financial advisor if you have questions about their firm's Privacy Policy.
  2. Your financial advisor can authorize PIE to allow the exchange of data between moneyguidepro.com and other programs or websites that your advisor uses in their business, and your personal information can be included in these data exchanges. Except for data exchanges that have been authorized by your advisor, PIE does not disclose or share your personal information with any third party, unless required by law to do so (for example, to comply with a subpoena).
  3. We use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption, which is the industry standard for secure data transfer software, to ensure data you transmit through the Internet is protected against unauthorized access.
