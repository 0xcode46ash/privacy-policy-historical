# Monzo – It's time for a new kind of bank

Monzo Bank Ltd ("we", "our", "us"), operating as Monzo, is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. 

This Privacy Policy, together with our Terms and Conditions, sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.

We may collect and process the following personal data about you:

  8. Information you give us explicit permission to access from your mobile device, including your address book, photos, geolocation, gyroscopes, data from your cameras or microphones.

## Use of personal information

We process personal information for the purposes of: 

  1. providing you with our services; 
  2. monitoring, analysing and improving those services; 
  3. prevention of money-laundering, fraud & illegal activities, and the prosecution of offenders; 
  4. direct-marketing of our products and services, advising you of news and industry updates, events, promotions and competitions, reports and other information and carrying out market research campaigns; and 
  5. providing you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes. 



## Marketing

We will not share identifiable personal data with third parties for the purposes of direct marketing without your explicit consent. 

We may use and disclose information in aggregate (so that no individuals are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes. 

## Use of IP addresses and cookies

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system information and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. 

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. A cookie is a small data file which is sent from a web server to a web browser when that browser visits the server's website. We use cookies to identify you when you visit this website, keep track of your browsing patterns and build up a demographic profile. They help us to improve our website and deliver a better and more personalised service. 

They enable us to: 

  1. Estimate our audience size and usage pattern; 
  2. Store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our website according to your individual interest; 
  3. Speed up your searches; and 
  4. Recognise when you return to our website. 



If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computers, you should set your browser to refuse cookies. However, switching off cookies will restrict your use of our website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our website. 

## ￼Where we store your personal data

The data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. 

## Disclosure of your information

We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group of companies, which includes our subsidiaries, our ultimate owner and any undertakings owned by it. 

We may disclose your personal information to third parties: 

  1. In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; 
  2. If Monzo Bank Ltd or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets; 
  3. If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction; 
  4. If you give explicit permission to do so.
