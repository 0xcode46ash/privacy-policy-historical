_[**click here**](http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/termsofuse.html)_

.  DreamWorks is providing this Policy to explain our online information practices and the way that we may collect, use and disclose information about you. Your use of the Site indicates that you have read and accepted our privacy practices, as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

**_If you do not agree with any term or condition of this Policy or the Terms of Use Agreement, do not use the Site._**

**The Information We Collect and How We Use It.**

DreamWorks does not intentionally share any Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) with any unaffiliated third party except:  (1) as described in this Policy; (2) as disclosed at the time your Personally Identifiable Information is provided; or (3) with your consent.

DreamWorks learns certain information about you from your visit to the Site, and what we do with this information depends on what you do when you are visiting the Site, the information that you provide and the choices that you make with respect to information that we collect.  This Policy lets you know what choices, access and security you have with respect to the information DreamWorks collects.

When we use the term “ **Personally Identifiable Information** ” we mean any information that can be used to identify a specific individual, such as name, address, telephone number, email address, resume information, date of birth or pictures.  When we refer to “ **Aggregate Information** ” we mean information that does not allow us to identify a specific individual, such as demographic information, areas visited on the Site or what browser was used to access the Site.

**_Personally Identifiable Information._**

DreamWorks may collect, use, and store Personally Identifiable Information about you when you provide such information.  What we collect depends on what information you choose to provide to us.  DreamWorks may collect and use such Personally Identifiable Information:  (i) to provide you with requested information or services relating to the Site, its motion pictures, television programs or other business activities; (ii) to send you promotions or newsletters; (iii) to permit you to enter sweepstakes or contests; (iv)  to evaluate you for job opportunities at Dreamworks if you submit a resume through our Careers section; (v) to allow you to participate in online games; (vi) to allow you to post to the Site; (vii) to effectively administer the Site and our business operations; (viii) to fulfill your purchases; and (ix) as disclosed when you provide your information.

On certain areas of the Site you may also provide names and email addresses to allow you to send information or materials (such as articles, trailers or themed e-cards) to other individuals.  If you choose to participate in these offerings, please make sure that you have permission to enter the other individual’s information.  DreamWorks will not use the other individual’s email address that you provide to us for any other purpose, unless otherwise disclosed to you at the time you provide such information.

If you choose to participate in user forums that may be hosted on the Site, you will have the opportunity to share ideas and thoughts about various topics with other visitors.  Such user forums may consist of a web blog, chat functionality (including within a game), message board and other interactive services we may offer from time to time.  We may also provide you with the ability to create public profiles on the Site.  Use of user forums and profiles is governed by the Site’s **[Terms of Use](http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/termsofuse.html)**. User forums and profiles may be accessible by all visitors or all participating visitors, and users of these services should be mindful that any information posted to any user forum or profile, including any Personally Identifiable Information, will become public information and will be available to other visitors to the Site.  Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy does not apply to protect any information, including any Personally Identifiable Information, that you may disclose in user forums and profiles.  Accordingly, if you choose to participate in any user forums or create any profiles, and to post information to such user forums or profiles, please use discretion.

In some cases, we may use a third party payment service to collect and process payments made through the Site.  In such cases, you will be directed to a web page hosted by such third party, and not by us, and any Personally Identifiable Information that you provide through the this web page will be collected by such third party, not by us, and will be subject to such third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Policy.  We have no control over, and shall not be responsible for, such third party’s use of your Personally Identifiable Information.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE COLLECTION, USE AND/OR DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION THROUGH A THIRD PARTY PAYMENT SERVICE OR BY ANY THIRD PARTIES.

**_Non-Personally Identifiable Information._**

DreamWorks may gather and store Aggregate Information about visitors.  The collection of this Aggregate Information serves a variety of purposes, including enabling DreamWorks to measure the number of visitors to various portions of the Site, diagnose problems with our server, administer the Site and track visitor activity.  Among other things, DreamWorks will use this Aggregate Information to learn more about what you and our customers are expecting from our services, and to tailor and improve the Site.  Because Aggregate Information collected on the Site does not personally identify you, we may use Aggregate Information for any purpose whatsoever, and share Aggregate Information with third parties for any purpose whatsoever.

DreamWorks and its service providers may collect environmental variables (such as your MAC address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version).  Cookies or other similar technologies may be used by DreamWorks or others, including third-parties, to gather information.  Cookies are electronic files that your web browser places on your hard drive to retain information relating to visits to and use of a website.  Although cookies allow you to visit the Site more efficiently, you may elect to disengage them by changing your browser properties.  Each browser is different, so please review your browser properties to determine how to disengage cookies. 

In addition, we may collect data by using so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “ **Pixel Tags** ”) in connection with Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, track the actions of Site users and e-mail recipients, determine the success of marketing campaigns and compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates.  ****  
Your Internet Protocol (“ **IP** ”) address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.  This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited.  Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites. 

**When We Disclose Personally Identifiable Information.**

DreamWorks works with third parties who provide services to it and we may share your Personally Identifiable Information with those third parties, including without limitation: website hosting or information technology consulting services, website management, distribution, marketing and promotion services or partners, newsletters, data analysis, legal services, accounting services, credit card processing services, purchase fulfillment services and other administrative and back-up and security services. 

If you elect to participate in a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, DreamWorks may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information in connection with such sweepstakes, contest or other promotion.  Such disclosures may include, for example, posting your entry or submission and attributing it to you, fulfilling your prize, including your name on a published winners list, sharing information with a co-sponsor or promotional partner or as provided under the official rules relating to the sweepstakes, contest or promotion.

DreamWorks may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to:  (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries or requests; (3) comply with valid legal process; (4) protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of DreamWorks, Site visitors or the public; (5) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (6) enforce our Terms of Use Agreement. 

In addition, DreamWorks may disclose Personally Identifiable Information to third parties whose products and services we believe may be of interest to you for their marketing purposes.  
In the event there is a change in the corporate structure of DreamWorks including without limitation, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation or transfer of substantial assets, DreamWorks may, in its sole and absolute discretion, transfer, sell or assign information collected on and through the Site, including without limitation, Aggregate Information and Personally Identifiable Information concerning visitors, to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third parties. 

**Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy.**

Protecting the privacy of children is especially important.  For that reason, we support and comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), and we do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children without parental consent.  We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children’s use of online activities regularly.  We will not condition a child’s participation in an online activity on the child providing more Personally Identifiable Information than is reasonably necessary for participation in such activity.  References to “child” or “children” throughout this Policy refer to children under the age of thirteen (13).  “Parent” is used to refer to both parents and legal guardians.

**_Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information About Children_**.

Children may access some content on the Site, including certain games and activities, without providing any Personally Identifiable Information.  To register for our newsletter, post to user forums, play certain online games, enter contests and sweepstakes, and to participate in other activities that may involve the collection of Personally Identifiable Information, children must first enter their date of birth and provide a parent’s email address.  An email will be sent to parents of children alerting them to the child’s registration. 

When children register for our newsletter, DreamWorks will send an email to the parent offering the opportunity to opt out of allowing his or her child to participate.  The parent may submit his or her determination to opt out to DreamWorks via a web form.  If the parent does not opt out within forty-eight (48) from when we send out such an email, we will assume the parent has consented to the use or collection of Personally Identifiable Information from the child.  DreamWorks will collect the child’s email address and use this information to send children newsletters and important information regarding the Site (including changes to our terms, conditions and policies).  ****

Before allowing children to participate in online activities that involve the collection of Personally Identifiable Information, including certain games, sweepstakes, contests, user forums and chat functionality (including within games), DreamWorks will send an email to parents requesting their verifiable consent.  The parent may submit his or her consent to DreamWorks via a web form.  In some cases, we may obtain parental consent by other means.  For example, if a parent is purchasing a membership for the child, we will require the parent to submit his or her credit card information, verify the credit card (and process the purchase using the credit card), and may obtain the parent’s consent as part of this process.  DreamWorks will send a confirmation email to the parent’s email address confirming receipt of consent.  Once the consent is received from the parent, each child who registers for these activities may be asked to enter information such as:  date of birth, first name, a password, address, email address and other information that the child may choose to submit.  We use filtering services to help ensure that Personally Identifiable Information of children will be deleted from postings submitted to user forums and from chat conversations before these postings appear on the Site.  DreamWorks uses this information to notify contest winners, allow children to play games, allow children to access and post to user forums, chat to other users, send other marketing communications and allow children to participate in our promotions. 

DreamWorks also may collect an email address or other online contact information from a child for the sole purpose of responding on a one-time basis to a specific request from the child. In such cases, DreamWorks will not use that information to make further contacts with the child and will delete that contact information from its records after making the requested one-time response. 

DreamWorks currently does not disclose Personally Identifiable Information about children to third parties, as defined by COPPA.  We may disclose such information to service providers that provide services to us, such as support Site operations and online services and other services.  

**_Collection and Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information About Children._**

DreamWorks may collect non-personally identifiable information or Aggregate Information from children in the manner described in the section above entitled “Non-Personally Identifiable Information.”  Because Aggregate Information does not personally identify any child, we may use and/or disclose such information for any purpose. 

**_Parental Rights._**

COPPA provides that parents of children can:  (1) review a description of the specific types of Personally Identifiable Information collected from your child; (2) refuse to allow any further use, maintenance in retrievable form or future collection of Personally Identifiable Information about your child; (3) obtain any Personally Identifiable Information collected from your child; and (4) delete Personally Identifiable Information collected from your child that is contained on the Site.  To exercise any of these rights, please contact us by writing us (including your email address) at DreamWorks Animation LLC, 1000 Flower Street, Glendale, California 91201, Attention:  DreamWorks Animation Web Contact.  DreamWorks will send a confirmation email to your last known email address of the changes to or deletion of your child’s Personally Identifiable Information. ****

In some cases, we may permit the parent to exercise some or all of these rights through use of an online dashboard.   The dashboard may also allow the parent to choose the type of activity the child can engage in (for example, whether the child will be able to chat on the Sites, or just have access to “canned” chat, which consists of phrases created by DreamWorks) and/or to otherwise restrict the child’s activities on the Sites (for example, the number of hours, or what days, the child can play games on the Sites). 

**Changing Personally Identifiable Information.**

If you would like to correct or change Personally Identifiable Information that you have previously provided to us, you can write to us (and include your email address) at DreamWorks Animation LLC, 1000 Flower Street, Glendale, California 91201, Attention:  DreamWorks Animation Web Contact. 

**Choice and Opt Out.**

When you provide us with your Personally Identifiable Information we may ask you to indicate whether you are interested in receiving our newsletter or other email communications from us.  We may also ask you if you are interested in receiving email or other communications from our affiliates and from selected third parties about products and activities that we believe may be of interest to you.  At any time, you may change your preferences by:  (1) sending us an email at DWAWebContact@DreamWorksAnimation **.** com; (2) writing to us (and include your email address) at DreamWorks Animation LLC, 1000 Flower Street, Glendale, California 91201, Attention: DreamWorks Animation Web Contact; or (3) using the unsubscribe function in the promotional email.  DreamWorks will provide an on-screen confirmation of the changes to or deletion of your Personally Identifiable Information and your preferences. 

**Notice to California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights:**

The California Civil Code permits California residents to request that DreamWorks not share Personally Identifiable Information about you with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  You may use any of the options described above to advise us that you would like us not to share your Personally Identifiable Information. 

Using the above options, you may request that we refrain from or cease sharing your information with (a) third parties that provide products and services we think may be of interest to you for the third parties’ marketing purpose; or (b) DreamWorks affiliated entities for their marketing purposes.  We will update your preferences as soon as reasonably practical. 

**Location of Information Collected and Maintained.**

The Site is hosted in the United States.  By providing Personally Identifiable Information and other information on the Site, you understand and consent to the collection, use, processing and transfer of such information to the United States. 

**Security.**

DreamWorks takes reasonable security precautions to safeguard the Personally Identifiable Information that you choose to provide against the loss, misuse, alteration and unauthorized access of such information.  Unfortunately, no security system is perfect and no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at DWAWebContact@DreamWorksAnimation.com.

**Links to Other Websites.**

On the Site, you may have the opportunity to follow a link from or to other websites maintained by third parties (e.g., iTunes and Amazon).   Because these other websites may not be hosted or controlled by DreamWorks, however, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites.  Therefore, the privacy policies with respect to those websites may differ from those applicable to the Site and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of each of those other websites. 

**Changes to this Policy.**

DreamWorks reserves the right to modify this Policy and any modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting.  You can review the current version of this Policy by clicking on the “Privacy Policy” link at the bottom of every page of the Site.  We will announce material changes to this Policy, to be determined in DreamWorks’ sole and absolute discretion, by posting the revised draft of this Policy on the Site.  You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the "Last Updated" legend at the top of this page.  By continuing to use the Site after a revised policy has been posted, you will be deemed to have agreed to such changes.  If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, as it may be amended from time to time, in whole or part, please do not continue using the Site.  If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please feel free to contact us at DWAWebContact@DreamWorksAnimation.com.
