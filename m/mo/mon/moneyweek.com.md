The following provides detail about our Privacy Policy. In general, we use the personal information that we collect from you to process orders, identify personal preferences and match your needs with relevant products and services.

**Note:** This policy only applies to MoneyWeek Ltd's websites and not to the web sites of other companies, individuals or organisations to which we provide links.

  
You signify your consent to us collecting and using this information by your use of this web site. Should for any reason we elect to change our Policy, we will notify you of those changes here, so that you are always kept informed of how we collect and use the information, and when we would disclose it.

Your personal information may also be sold, traded or licensed to third parties (who may be located outside the European Economic Area) in order to enable them to send you details that they think will interest you. By submitting your personal details to us you consent to this transfer. Again, if you do not wish to receive this information, please send a blank e-mail to [moneyweek@cisubs.co.uk](mailto:moneyweek@cisubs.co.uk?subject=Consent).

In addition, your data may sometimes also be used by us and our associated companies to inform you about changes to our web site, new services and offers that you might find interesting. If you do not wish to receive this information, please send a blank e-mail to [moneyweek@cisubs.co.uk](mailto:moneyweek@cisubs.co.uk?subject=Consent).

  
**1.** If you send us information, we ask you to enter your e-mail address. You can elect not to have your e-mail address displayed alongside your posting.

**2.** We will collect information about your tastes and preferences both when you tell us what these are and by analysis of customer traffic, including by using cookies (see below).

**3.** If you enter a contest or promotion we will ask for your name, address and e-mail address. This is so we can administer the contest and inform the winners.

**4.** We use information collected about you to personalise your visits to our web site and recommend goods or services to you. We also use the information to help us develop the design and layout of our web site to ensure that our sites are as useful and enjoyable as possible.

**5.** Sometimes we might use the information to let you know about functionality changes to our website, new goods, services or offers that you might find interesting. If you do not wish to receive this information, please send an e-mail to [moneyweek@cisubs.co.uk](mailto:moneyweek@cisubs.co.uk?subject=Consent).

  
We may at our discretion choose to sell, trade or licence your personal information to trustworthy third parties. You may instruct us not to do by sending an e-mail message to [moneyweek@cisubs.co.uk](mailto:moneyweek@cisubs.co.uk?subject=Consent). In addition, MoneyWeek Ltd may provide aggregate statistics about customers, traffic patterns and other site information to third parties, but these statistics will not include any information that could personally identify you.

MoneyWeek Ltd reserves the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate its systems properly or to protect itself or its users.

  
When you review your information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software encrypts the information that you input before it is transmitted to us. In addition, we have strict security procedures covering the storage and disclosure of your information in order to prevent unauthorised access to comply with the UK Data Protection Act of 1998. This means that sometimes we may ask for proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.

  
A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser. On revisiting moneyweek.com our computer server will recognise the cookie, giving us information about your last visit. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but usually you can alter the settings of your browser to prevent automatic acceptance. If you choose not to receive cookies, you may still use most of the features of our web site, including purchasing items.

  
We welcome your questions and comments about privacy issues and the design of our web site. Should you have such comments or have a complaint about how we are using your personal data, please send an e-mail to [moneyweek@cisubs.co.uk](mailto:moneyweek@cisubs.co.uk?subject=Consent).
