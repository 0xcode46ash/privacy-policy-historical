# Platform Privacy Policy

**MONETATE, INC. PLATFORM PRIVACY POLICY  
Last updated August 2016**

Monetate, Inc. (“Monetate,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a marketing optimization technology company. We have created this privacy policy (this “Platform Privacy Policy”) to inform you how our proprietary platform (the “Platform”) gathers, uses, and processes information on behalf of online marketers, website owners, leading brands and other businesses that use our services (collectively, our “Clients”).

**The information we collect**

In the course of operating the Platform and providing our services, Monetate collects the following types of information (collectively, the “Information”):

  1. Personal Information. Our Clients and/or their email service providers (“ESPs”) will send us your email address and/or other personal identifiers if you have opted to receive marketing or other communications from such Client.
  2. Information From Your Activity. Information that we or our technology providers may automatically collect when you visit, access, and/or use our Clients’ websites (the “Websites”), include your IP address; referring URL; time stamp; browser type and language; operating system; screen height; screen width; color depth; whether your computer is Java enabled; Internet connection type; whether or not your browser accepts cookies; pages viewed on the Websites; products viewed, placed in the cart, and purchased on the Websites; quantity, price, and purchase ID of products placed in cart and/or purchased on the Websites; and custom page data, as defined by our Clients.
  3. Inferred Information. Based on the Information we collect from your Website activity, search terms entered through your browser, and information gleaned from previous Monetate cookies, we may infer other information, such as zip code, country, state, time zone, weather, temperature, heat index, wind chill, or proximity to a shipping location.
  4. From Cookies and JavaScript Tags. We collect Information using “cookie” technology and JavaScript tags. Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to help us collect Information and to enhance your experience using the Websites. If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer. Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Websites may not function properly. We use JavaScript tags to trigger a sequence of events that includes viewing a first-party cookie (or setting that cookie if it does not already exist) and to help us and our Clients tailor, analyze, manage, report and optimize your experience on the Websites.



**How we use and share the information**

Monetate uses and shares the Information only as follows.

  * When we receive your email address and/or other personal identifiers, we will analyze such data and instruct our Clients and/or their ESPs what content to insert into marketing or other communications to you. Our Clients and/or their ESPs will then send you a tailored email based on these instructions.
  * We will access, use, and share the Information as required to fulfill our contractual obligations to our Clients or subsequent requests for service and/or support by our Clients.
  * Our technical staff may require periodic access to Information to monitor system performance and network capacity, test and fix systems, and develop and implement upgrades to systems.
  * We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include providing technical assistance and customer service. These other companies will have access to the Information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law.
  * In an ongoing effort to better understand visitors to the Websites, the Platform, and our products and services, we may analyze the Information in aggregate form in order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Platform and/or our products and services. This aggregate information does not identify you personally.
  * We may share some or all of your Information with any of our subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us.
  * As we develop our businesses, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, sale of assets, dissolution, or similar event, the Information may be part of the transferred assets.
  * To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose the Information: (i) when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency; or (ii) whenever we believe that disclosing such Information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Monetate or others.



**Accessing and modifying information and communication preferences**

If you would like to opt-out of Monetate’s collection of Information about you using cookies or JavaScript tags, please follow the instructions found on our Clients’ Websites. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner.
