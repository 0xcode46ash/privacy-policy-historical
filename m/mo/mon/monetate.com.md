**MONETATE, INC. PLATFORM PRIVACY POLICY  
Last Updated May 2015**

Monetate, Inc. (“ _Monetate_ ,” “ _we_ ,” “ _us_ ,” or “ _our_ ”) is a marketing optimization technology company. We have created this privacy policy (this “ _Platform Privacy Policy_ ”) to inform you how our proprietary platform (the “ _Platform_ ”) gathers, uses, and processes information on behalf of online marketers, website owners, leading brands, and other businesses that use our services (collectively, our “ _Clients_ ”).

**_The Information We Collect_**

In the course of operating the Platform and providing our services, Monetate collects the following types of information (collectively, the “ _Information_ ”).

  1. _Personal Information_. Our Clients and/or their e-mail service providers (“ _ESPs_ ”) will send us your e-mail address and/or other personal identifiers if you have opted to receive marketing or other communications from such Client.
  2. _Information From Your Activity_. Information that we or our technology providers may automatically collect when you visit, access, and/or use our Clients’ websites (the “ _Websites_ ”), include your IP address; referring URL; time stamp; browser type and language; operating system; screen height; screen width; color depth; whether your computer is Java enabled; Internet connection type; whether or not your browser accepts cookies; pages viewed on the Websites; products viewed, placed in the cart, and purchased on the Websites; quantity, price, and purchase ID of products placed in cart and/or purchased on the Websites; and custom page data, as defined by our Clients.
  3. _Inferred Information_. Based on the Information we collect from your Website activity, search terms entered through your browser, and information gleaned from previous Monetate cookies, we may infer other information, such as zip code, country, state, time zone, weather, temperature, heat index, wind chill, or proximity to a shipping location.


  4. _From Cookies and JavaScript Tags_. We collect Information using “cookie” technology and JavaScript tags. Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to help us collect Information and to enhance your experience using the Websites. If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer. Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Websites may not function properly. We use JavaScript tags to trigger a sequence of events that includes viewing a first-party cookie (or setting that cookie if it does not already exist) and to help us and our Clients tailor, analyze, manage, report, and optimize your experience on the Websites.


  5. _Third Party Service Providers._ Our third-party service providers may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites, mobile websites and/or mobile applications across your various devices, in order to provide content and advertisements about goods and services of interest to you across those various devices. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices with respect to it, please: (1) visit  the  DAA opt-out program at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> or the Evidon opt-out program <http://www.ghosteryenterprise.com/global-opt-out> to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in browsers for ad serving purposes; and (2) download the Ghostery Ad Control application, available for iOS and Android, to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in mobile apps.
