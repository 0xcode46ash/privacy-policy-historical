It is the policy of mono to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our services.

Like most website operators, mono collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. mono's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how mono's visitors use its website. From time to time, mono may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

mono also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. mono does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information  
Certain visitors to mono's websites choose to interact with mono in ways that require mono to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that mono gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, mono collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with mono. mono does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Aggregated Statistics  
mono may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. mono may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, mono does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information  
mono discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on mono's behalf or to provide services available at mono's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using mono's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. mono reserves the right to share personally-identifying information with its parent company, business partners and otherwise related companies. Other than described above, mono discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when mono believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of mono, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a mono website and have supplied your email address, mono may send you emails and newsletters including ads to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with mono and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. mono takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Cookies  
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. mono uses cookies to help mono identify and track visitors, their usage of mono website, and their website access preferences. mono visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using mono's websites, with the drawback that certain features of mono's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Privacy Policy Changes  
Although most changes are likely to be minor, mono may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in mono's sole discretion. mono encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
