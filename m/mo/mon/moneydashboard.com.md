# Privacy - Money Dashboard

### Information Which We May Collect

To register to use our service you will have to supply us with your name and e-mail address, and choose a username and secure word. You do not have to supply any information simply to visit the site.

Once you have aggregated accounts (see “Other people who have to be able to access your information” below for an explanation) with us, we will have access to that information.

We keep track of the internet addresses from which Users visit us, and track the page(s) on our site that you visit. We analyse this data for trends and statistics.

### How we might use your information

We will use the personal information which we collect for the purposes of registering you as a User, correspondence, or participating in online surveys.

We ask for personal information at registration to enable us to ask security related questions if you later ask us for a new password.

In addition we will use your personal information and information from your account aggregation for the purposes of analysing it and making suggestions which may enable you to make savings or consider alternative or additional products to the ones which you are using. These suggestions can be delivered either in the service or by way of email or text messages to you.

We may perform statistical analyses of Users’ behaviour as a whole. This allows us to measure relative interest in various areas of our site for marketing and advertising purposes. Any information we collect is used to improve the content of the site; to enhance Users' experiences when visiting our site; to customise the content and/or layout of our pages, and to provide the services required by an individual User. We do not use personal identifying information for any reason that is not disclosed either in this Policy or at the time the information is requested.

We do not sell your data.

### Other people who have to be able to access your information

We use a company called Yodlee Inc. ([www.yodlee.com](http://www.yodlee.com/)) to provide software that lets you add details of the accounts which you want to include in the service (“account aggregation”). When you aggregate an account you will need to let Yodlee have access to your log in details, such as User name and password. This information is never disclosed to us.

Yodlee are headquartered in the USA. They have provided account aggregation to top U.K & U.S financial institutions for more than 10 years. We have a contract with Yodlee which requires them to meet the requirements of the Data Protection Act in just the same way as it applies to us.

### The information we may have to give to somebody else

We might have to disclose your personally identifiable information to comply with a court order, or similar legal requirement.

### Deleting your account

If you want to terminate your agreement, email [support@moneydashboard.com](mailto:support@moneydashboard.com) with details of your account (username, email address, first name and last name). For security we will confirm to you by email before closing your account. When confirmed your account will be closed and your ability to log in deactivated immediately.

### How long we keep your data

You can delete, or change, any of your personal information at any time. Once deleted by you the data will be deleted from our systems and we cannot access it.

If you delete your account we will delete all information which we hold on you.

### Use of email and text

You can use the service to provide you with email and text alerts which provide you with information which you want, eg your current account is close to becoming overdrawn. You can disable these alerts at any time.

We may use email or text in relation to administrative matters, eg sending you a replacement password, or to let you know about changes to the service. An example of this would be a proposed change to this Privacy Policy.

We will not email or text you in relation to promotional matters without your consent. You can withdraw this consent at any time by contacting us as above.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may need to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy we will tell you by email, or by a notice on our homepage.
