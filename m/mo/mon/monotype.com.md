Monotype Imaging Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal offices at 600 Unicorn Park Drive, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801 USA and its subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide (collectively, the “Company”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”), makes information, products, and services available, including on our Websites (the “Site(s)”), subject to the following Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy").  The Privacy Policy applies to all Company products and services, including any mobile applications that link to or display the Privacy Policy and/or the Site(s) (together, the “Services”).  This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the Company’s [**Terms and Conditions of Use**.](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms-of-use/)

**INFORMATION THE COMPANY MAY COLLECT:**

“ **Personal Information** ” means information that may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you, such as: name, address, email address, or phone or fax number. We do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been de-identified or aggregated so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual.

**“Usage Information”** means certain personally non-identifiable information that we or our third-party service providers may collect through a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Services. Usage Information may include, but is not limited to, the type of browser, device, and operating system you are using, the URL that referred you to our Services, all of the parts of the Services that you interact, the time of day you use the Services, how and on what device you use one of our mobile applications (an “App”) including your usage of any image available to you within an App or other functionality of the App itself, and any third-party applications in which you use the Services. 

If we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.

**HOW THE COMPANY MAY COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION:**

**Personal Information Collection Directly From You.** We may collect Personal Information when you register for any of the Services, visit certain areas of the Services, purchase products, subscribe to any communications from us, or otherwise voluntarily provide it to us. 

**Social Media Connection.** We may collect Personal Information from social media websites, such as Facebook or Twitter, when you connect to any of your Company accounts using your social media account.  For example, when you log in with your Facebook credentials, we may collect certain information from Facebook, such as your email address, profile picture, and friend list.  We may also collect Personal or Usage Information from social media websites or apps when you choose to use the Services in connection with that social media provider, such as when you use one of our mobile application keyboards to insert a sticker in Facebook Messenger.

**Customer Support.** We may collect Personal Information that you provide to us through your communications with our customer-support team.

**Cookies, Automatic Data Collection, and Related Technologies.** We and third parties that provide functionality for our Services may collect Usage Information, by using cookies, server logs, and other similar technology as you use the Services. This Usage information may be used to improve the quality of the Services, such as to store your preferences, customize the Services, and provide more relevant advertising.

A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and to help provide better service to you. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly. As you navigate the Services, cookies may collect information including internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), device identifiers, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. This information may be used to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ overall movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use only, to help us understand how users interact with our Services.
