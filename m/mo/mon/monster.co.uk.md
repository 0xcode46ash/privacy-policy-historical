Information you share in public areas of Monster or place in the searchable CV database may be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world. We strive to provide a safe, secure environment by attempting to limit access to our database to legitimate users, but we cannot guarantee that unauthorised parties will not gain access. We also cannot control how authorised users store or transfer information you give to us, so you should not post sensitive information to Monster.
