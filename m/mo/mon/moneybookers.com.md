### Privacy Statement

**Data Protection**  
Any information you provide us with will only be disclosed in accordance with the Data Protection Act of 1998. 

**Collection of Personal Information**  
To open your moneybookers account, we must obtain certain personal information, such as name, address, email or phone number as well as demographic information like age. For certain optional transactions, we also collect selected financial information such as credit card details. For certain high amount transactions, we are legally required to report some personally identifiable information to the authorities. For verification purposes we reserve the right to request proof of identification in an offline format. Your IP address and access times are tracked against your user id for the dual purposes of preventing fraud and creating an audit trail when sending a payment, or logging onto our secure server.

**Use of Personal Information**  
We only use your personal information to service your account and to improve our services to you. However, we do share some financial information as part of normal business operations with banks or credit card processing and verification services. These entities may not use your information for secondary purposes, unless required by law. Otherwise, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES will information you provide to moneybookers be transmitted in any way to a third party. 

**Control of Personal Information**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or deactivate that user's personally identifiable information provided to us. This can usually be done at the "profile" page or by emailing our Customer Support at service@moneybookers.com. However, please understand we cannot completely delete user information because of legal/regulatory and technical back up requirements.

**Communication**  
Upon registration every user will receive an email confirming his successful registration. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services and special deals via newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance or we change our policies we might send you an email.  


**Security**  
Moneybookers secures your account information from unauthorised access, use or disclosure. You must enter your email and password each time you want to access your account information or make transactions. Never share your account details with anyone. If you are concerned that your password has been compromised, you can change it any time you like once you are logged on. Your account login, personal details and all money transactions are secured using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology with high security 128bit encryption, certified by VeriSign.
