We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features.

You can choose not to provide this information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to register and participate in the features offered through the Site.

If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address.
