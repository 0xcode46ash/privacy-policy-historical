# Monarch Airlines | Privacy Policy

### Data

In accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998, we Monarch Airlines Limited are a Data Controller. In order to process your booking, we need to collect certain personal details from you. These details may include, where applicable, the names and addresses of party members, contact details such as telephone numbers and e-mail addresses, credit/debit card or other payment details and in some instances information relating to any disability or medical condition which may affect the chosen flight arrangements. If any other personal details are required, we will of course tell you.

### Passing on your personal details

We may need to pass on some or all of the personal details you provide us with to certain governmental agencies and third parties in order to affect your travel arrangements or deal with and/or investigate any emergency incident or in the interests of security and/or because we are required to do so by law. Such third parties may include, but are not limited to, any carrier that we may use in substitution for Monarch Airlines (in accordance with our conditions of carriage), a handling agent, credit/debit card company, bank, accommodation supplier (for example in the event of a delay), other supplier and/or third party such as, for example, a car hire company, airport parking company or currency exchange company that we may deal with from time to time on your behalf. Such third parties may be situated outside the European Union. We may need to pass your personal details to certain governmental agencies in the interests of security and/or because we are required to so by law. For example, the US government now requires by law that every airline discloses flight and reservation data concerning all passengers travelling to/from the United States of America. Where you give us details relating to your physical or mental health we will ask you to give us your written consent to our holding, using and passing on such information. Except where expressly permitted by the Data Protection Act, we will only deal with the personal details you give us as set out above unless you agree otherwise. For example, if we wish to use any of your personal details for marketing purposes, we will tell you and allow you the opportunity to tell us that you do not want us to use those details for that purpose. We will not pass your details to third parties for the purpose of marketing. Subject to the exceptions set out in this Privacy Policy, we promise to keep all personal details you give us in connection with your booking confidential. We have appropriate security measures in place to protect this information.

### Your right to ask us about information we hold on you

You are generally entitled to ask us what details of yours we hold and are being processed by us, for what purpose we hold and/or are processing them and to whom we have disclosed or may disclose them to. Accordingly you may send a letter to the Marketing Department, Monarch Airlines Limited, Prospect House, Prospect Way, London Luton Airport, Luton LU2 9NU. We may charge a fee. We promise to respond to your request within 40 days of receiving the request in writing with the fee. There are circumstances where we shall be within our rights to refuse such a request.

### Your responsibility to provide/correct inaccurate information

If you believe that any of your personal information that is held and/or being processed by us is incorrect then please write to us immediately as we cannot be held responsible for any problems that may arise due to inaccurate information that you have provided us with.

### Opting out from receiving further marketing information from us

If you have previously registered with us to receive e-mail updates or have not opted out from receiving information from us by e-mail, telephone or post when purchasing products and services from us in the past and would like to receive no further communications of this kind then please write to us at the above address or e-mail us at nomoremail@monarch-airlines.com.
