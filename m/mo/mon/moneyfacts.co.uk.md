# Privacy Policy - Moneyfacts

## Privacy Policy

We place paramount importance on customer service and aim to meet your expectations on every occasion. To achieve this aim we need accurate personal information about you.

We have a legal obligation under the Data Protection Act to ensure that all information held and processed about you complies with the principles of the Act.

This privacy policy details how we ensure personal information about you is kept secure and confidential.

Please read this policy carefully as once you use this site and/or any of our services or products you will be regarded as having accepted this privacy policy.

Moneyfacts.co.uk Limited (company number 6615303) is the data controller. Our registered office is Moneyfacts House, 66 – 70 Thorpe Road, Norwich NR1 1BJ. If you have any queries relating to data protection issues please contact the Data Unit at the above address.

If you do not accept this privacy policy do not use this site.

Please note links to other websites and the treatment of personal data by those sites is not covered by this policy.

## The Data Protection Act:

The Data Protection Act puts obligations on users of personal information and lays down principles for its use. One principle states that information has to be processed fairly and lawfully. This means that you are entitled to know how we intend to use any information you provide. You can then decide whether you want to give it to us. To provide outstanding customer service we need accurate customer information.

## The information we hold:

We do not hold sensitive information, but just enough to know who you are. We will only use this for the purpose specified when you gave us your information, and will not be passed to any third party.

Moneyfacts respects the privacy of people using this site. The Moneyfacts site (‘the site’) is mainly designed to provide information and to search for different products and services. We do, however, monitor usage of the service by tracking a users IP Address and record automatically their activity around the site on the Web Server. Moneyfacts may share this information with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. However, (unless otherwise required by law) only aggregate information is disclosed about a user that does not identify or disclose information about any individual. For example it may be disclosed how frequently the average user visits the site.

The site uses cookies for collecting the information detailed above about the use of this site. Again, this information does not identify or disclose any personal details other than your IP address. If you do not wish to receive cookies then you will be unable to use the website.

## Your rights:

Under the Data Protection Act you have the right of access to information we hold about you on our records. The Act allows us to charge a fee of £10 for this service. If anything is inaccurate or incorrect, please let us know and **we will** correct it.

## E-mail:

If you e-mail us, or give us your e-mail address, we will keep a record of it. We may use it to contact you occasionally about other products and services that may interest you, unless you ask us not to do so. We will not give your e-mail address to any third parties.

## Telephone calls:

We may record telephone conversations to offer you additional security, resolve complaints and improve our service standards. Conversations may also be monitored for staff training purposes.
