Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at the above address.
The Data Protection Act puts obligations on users of personal information and lays down principles
for its use. One principle states that information has to be processed fairly and lawfully. This means
that you are entitled to know how we intend to use any information you provide. You can then
decide whether you want to give it to us.
If we are requested to provide any information to assist with law enforcement enquiries, we will do
so.

preferences for our regular emails.

service possible. If you provide personal information to a third party to use their services, e.g. via a
lead form, they may pass us your information. If you have opted-in to receiving emails from
Moneyfacts.co.uk via a third party, they will pass us your name and email address. We will ensure
that your personal information is captured and passed securely at all times.
We do not hold sensitive information, but just enough to know who you are and the products you
are interested in. We will only use this for the purpose specified when you gave us your information,
and it will not be passed to any third party, other than to fulfil your request, e.g. for a call back from
an adviser.
If you place a comment on our blog website, we will display your user name against your comment.
You can choose a user name that does not reveal your identity.


Cookie Policy
About Cookies
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer (or other device you use to access the
internet) by the websites that you visit, or companies that advertise on them. We use the term
‘cookie’ to refer to cookies and other types of file (including pixel tags), all of which are slightly
different, but do a similar function.
There are many different types of cookies, which differ in terms of how intrusive they are to your
browsing experience. You can learn about cookies and how to control them at
www.aboutcookies.org. The main types are:
        Strictly necessary cookies – These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move
         around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website.
         Without these cookies, services you have asked for, like returning search results, cannot be
         provided. These are usually placed by the website you are visiting (first party cookies) and
         will expire when you leave that website (session cookies).
        Performance Cookies – These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website,
         for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error pages from web
         pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these
         cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a
         website works. These will mainly be first party cookies, but could be set by third party
         websites. They may be session cookies or ‘persistent cookies’ that stay on your computer
         after your browsing session has finished.
        Functionality Cookies - These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make
         (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more
         personal features. For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local content by
         storing a cookie in the region in which you are currently located. These cookies can also be
         used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages
         that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for
         such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect
         may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. They
         may be session cookies, but will mainly be persistent cookies. Again they could be set by
         first or third parties.
        Targeting or Advertising Cookies - These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant
         to you and your interests They are also used to limit the number of times you see an
         advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They
         are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They
         remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other
         organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked
         to site functionality provided by the other organisation. This type of cookie will normally be
         set by third parties, and will almost always be persistent. They will track you as you browse
         the internet.
Moneyfacts.co.uk Use of Cookies
Moneyfacts respects the privacy of customers using its site. The Moneyfacts site (‘the site’) is
designed to provide information and allow you to apply for different products and services. We
monitor usage of the site by tracking your IP Address and automatically recording your activity
around the site on the Web Server. Moneyfacts may share aggregated activity information with
advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties (For example: we may disclose
how frequently the average user visits the site). However, (unless otherwise required by law) we will
not identify or disclose personal information about you.


The Moneyfacts.co.uk site uses cookies for the following reasons:
     1. We, or our partners may use performance cookies to help us analyse the way our
         customers use the site, including information about your computer, your domain name, IP
         address, operating system, browser version, how long you stay on a page, the route you
         took to navigate through the pages and the website you visited prior to reaching our site.
         We use Google Analytics for this purpose. This also helps us measure the effectiveness of
         our site features, offerings, advertisements, and e-mail communications (by determining
         which e-mails you open and act upon), and also applies to the Moneyfacts Blog website.
     2. We use strictly necessary cookies and performance cookies to help us identify when a user
         clicks a 'proceed' button to apply or find out more about a product or service. We do this so
         we can show the provider how many people using Moneyfacts.co.uk clicked on a particular
         product or service to fulfil any commercial arrangement we may have in place. We use
         Google Analytics for this purpose. If we couldn’t use this type of cookie, we would not make
         any money and would be unable to offer our services; Read more about how we earn
         money.
     3. We use targeting / advertising cookies to display advertising on our site. We use cookies
         from a third party website called Doubleclick for this purpose. When any advert is shown on
         the site, a targeting / advertising cookie may be placed on your computer. Please note, our
         advertisers may also use both session and persistent cookies over which we have no
         control. We may also place on you’re computer a tracking cookie from our partner
         company Captify Media Limited which are designed to display to you relevant
         advertisements on other websites that you subsequently visit, based on your browsing
         history. No personal data is passed to our advertising partners and they cannot identify you
         or contact you directly. The cookies used for this purpose process only the search terms
         you use and technical information relating to your PC. Users may prevent Captify cookies
         from being set on their devices at http://www.captify.co.uk/privacy.php
     4. We send out regular information by email. These emails will contain a tracking cookie
         which allows us to identify whether the email has been opened. This does not include any
         personal information about you.
We may also provide links to third party sites such as Twitter, who may use their own cookies which
we have no control over. Please refer to their cookie policy for full details.
Third parties who advertise on Moneyfacts.co.uk may deploy advertising and targeting cookies to
your device. These are mainly by digital marketing companies that track your movements around
the web to maximise the efficiency of marketing campaigns. We have no control over these
cookies. Examples of these cookies include:
             Mookie1.com
             Atdmt.com
             Adnxs.com
             Ad.yieldmanager.com
             Media6degrees.com
             Xgraph.com
If you do not wish to receive cookies then you can disable these within your browser (this will not
normally apply to pixel tags and the other file types). The Help portion of the toolbar on most
browsers should tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies (including those
from specific websites), how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how
to disable non-essential types of cookies. However, this may mean that not all of the functions of
the site will be available to you.
Other sites
This Privacy and Cookie Policy applies to Moneyfacts.co.uk only. We do not exercise control over
third party sites displayed when you have clicked through from within our charts via a 'proceed'
button, from advertising displayed on our site or one of our partners. These third party sites may
place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or collect personal information
from you.
