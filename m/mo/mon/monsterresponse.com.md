worthy communication practices. This means providing email recipients with reliable, easy-to-use methods of

Best Practices
    (a) MI follows best practices as those described by the IAB’s privacy guidelines
         http://www.iab.net/standards/privacy.asp and email marketing best practices:
         a. The IAB’s Ethical Email Guarantee includes the following assurances for advertisers:
              - List Provider guarantees that all records they deliver to on behalf of the client           have specifically
              agreed to receive third party offers.
              - List Provider agrees to fully disclose the source of any email address record delivered to on behalf of the
              client, including the exact method by which permission was obtained, upon inquiry from either the client
              or any individual receiving email from the List Provider on behalf of the client.
              - List Provider assures that it is mailing the contracted volume to unique email addresses in the exact
              quantity ordered. List Provider will not jeopardize the client's brand by over-delivering above the
              contracted amount unless specifically requested by the client through an amendment of the contractual
              terms.
              - List Provider assures that delivered mailings are sent to the exact select criteria designated by the client
              in the contractual terms as determined by the contact's most recently recorded data with the List Provider.
              - List Provider agrees to honor all unsubscribe requests that may result from the campaign
              - If the List Provider has violated any of these guarantees on a contracted mailing then they will gladly
              refund the invoiced amount.
    (b) MI works with the Client in recommending and helping to implement email marketing best practices into the
         Client’s marketing strategy. MI uses the above guidelines as its main source of recommendation.
    (c) MI works primarily with in-house opt-in lists of the Client. From time to time, MI will work with select 3rd party
         list providers to help append new names to an opt-in list. MI will only work with those list management
         companies that openly disclose procedures for gathering names, policies and mailing procedures—and where
         procedures fully comply with double opt-in methodology. MI does not use any list management company that
         sells or provides these lists to 3rd parties to mail themselves.
    (d) At the beginning of an Agreement with the Client, MI will work with the client to review current best practices
         and procedures and set a Procedures Agreement in place with the Client based off of Client’s policies and
         those of MI’s. Should a MI Client be found to disregarding best practices set under agreement with MI, said
         Client will be removed from working with MI. MI is not, however, responsible for the privacy policies of its
         Clients or actions of Client managers given permission by Client organizations to use online administration
         tools.
