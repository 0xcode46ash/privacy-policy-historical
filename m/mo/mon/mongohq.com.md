MongoHQ does not share customer information of any kind with anyone or any third party. We will not sell or rent your name or personal information to any third party. We do not sell, rent or provide outside access to our mailing list or any data we store. Any data that a user stores via our facilities is wholly owned by that user or business. At anytime a user or business is free to take their data and leave, or to simply delete their data from our facilities.

### We Only Collect Necessary Information

MongoHQ only collects such personal information that is necessary for you to access and use our services.
