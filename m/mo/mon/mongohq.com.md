We do not sell, rent or provide outside access to our mailing list or any data we store. Any data that a user stores via our facilities is wholly owned by that user or business. At anytime a user or business is free to take their data and leave, or to simply delete their data from our facilities.

## We Only Collect Necessary Information

This personal information includes, but is not limited to, first and last name, zip code, email address, credit card information and/or other financial information and personal information necessary to generate proper legal documents and maintain proper billing methods for the services offered.

## We Protect Your Data

## We Still Have to Follow The Law

MongoHQ may release personal information if the partnership is required to by law, search warrant, subpoena, court order or fraud investigation. We may also use personal information in a manner that does not identify you specifically nor allow you to be contacted but does identify certain criteria about our Site’s users in general (such as we may inform third parties about the number of registered users, number of unique visitors, number of databases used, number of datastores, and the pages most frequently browsed, etc.).
