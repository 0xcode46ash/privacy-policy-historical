**Memolink strictly adheres to the Privacy Policy outlined below.**

We will closely guard any personally identifiable information you disclose to us during registration or at any other point during your memolink.com experience. Information will only be shared with a third party if a member requests for that information to be shared, by participating in an offer/program/opt-in/opt-out. A member may request that this information be shared, by opting-in to programs or newsletters that may require information such as, but not be limited toe, first name, last name, occupation, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, selected interests or date of birth. Not all offers/programs/opt-ins/opt-outs specify exactly which pieces of information will be shared. Please contact Memolink through [Member Support](http://support.memolink.com/) if you would like more information about which offers/programs/opt-ins/opt-outs require certain pieces of information to be shared. 

By joining Memolink, you are opting-in to receive mail from Memolink. You may select HTML or Text as your mail preference. If you do not select either HTML or Text as your mail preference, you will receive Text mail. You can unsubscribe from Memolink Mail at any time and still maintain an active Memolink account. 

**MEMOLINK PRIVACY STATEMENT**

**Information Collection and Use**

Memolink, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Memolink, Inc. collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

**Registration**

In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name, e-mail address and postal address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest, account information, changes in point offerings, and new offerings from us or our business partners. 

**Unsubscribe Requests**

If a member wishes to opt out of Memolink e-mails or unsubscribe their Memolink account, they may use the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any Memolink e-mail. Every Memolink e-mail contains a physical address to which a user can mail and unsubscribe request. Members may also send an unsubscribe request to our online [Member Support](http://support.memolink.com/) department at any time and a representative will opt that member out of Memomails within 3 days. 

**Personal Information**

We collect personal information from the user upon request for prize redemption. Here we ask a user to provide contact information (such as name and shipping address) and legitimate proof of address. Proof of address is required in order to guard Memolink, Inc. from fraudulent activities. This information is also used for shipping purposes to award earned prizes. If we have trouble processing an award, this contact information may be utilized to contact a user. 

**Our Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data we store on the user's hard drive containing information about the user's account and point earnings. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. There are two reasons for the use of cookies on our site. The first reason is that it helps us keep track of the points you earn during a given session. The second reason for using cookies on our site is that it allows you to move throughout our site and complete offers without being prompted by our security system to log in again after each activity. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site, however they will have to log on multiple times and they may risk losing some of the points they have earned. 

**Log Files**

We do track certain information such as type of browser and log on time for our own use. We use this information only to track where our users may be coming from and what type of software they are using. We keep this information so we can continuously improve our users' online experience and improve the Memolink Web Site. None of this information can ever be traced back to any specific person and is useful only to Memolink, Inc. 

**Links to Other Sites**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Memolink, Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the Memolink Web Site. Memolink, Inc. requests that users report any and all concerns about our partners' privacy practices directly to us through [Member Support](http://support.memolink.com/). 

**Security**

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. While we use both passwords and user names to protect information online, we also do everything in our power to protect users' information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our Member Support Team) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment and professionally maintained. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send a request to [Member Support](http://support.memolink.com/). 

**Special Offers and e-mail**

We send all new members a welcoming e-mail to verify password and username. We also require a new user to click on a link inserted in the initial e-mail to verify their account. Memolink does this in order to establish that the e-mail address given upon registration is not fraudulent. Established members will occasionally receive e-mails containing information regarding new offers or special promotions from Memolink or its partners if they have not opted out. "Opting-out" means the user does not wish to receive e-mails from memolink.com. The opt-out can be performed upon initial registration or later. When a member receives an e-mail from memolink.com and decides they no longer wish to receive e-mails or want to be removed from our system, they can open the e-mail and scroll to the bottom. At the bottom of the e-mail page there will be a brief description of how to have an account "opted-out". Once we receive information regarding these account changes we will make the specified changes as soon as possible. Please note that while Memolink can remove you from internal lists, if you have agreed to have your email transmitted to a 3rd party through our site in the past, removal from that list is not guaranteed. 

**Memolink Lotto**

Memolink Lotto is a service provided by Luckysurf Inc. to Memolink members. By joining Memolink, you agree to opt-in to a Memolink Lotto account. 

**Site and Service Announcements**

Under rare circumstances memolink.com may need to contact specific or all users in order to make an important announcement about the Memolink site or service changes. Members are not able to un-subscribe, or "opt-out" of these announcements, because they may contain very important information regarding their accounts. Before these measures are taken, however, Memolink will post information regarding changes directly on the web site. Memolink, Inc. reserves the right to contact users to correct account errors or to supply important information Memolink deems relevant. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

Memolink users are able to change their personal information at any time. The fastest way to change personal information is to log on to memolink.com and simply click on "change personal info". You will be prompted to enter your password again to change you personal information. If for some reason this page does not work, or there are any questions, users may contact our [Member Support](http://support.memolink.com/) Team. Users should send our support team a clear and detailed e-mail message and our Member Support Team will see to it the proper changes are made to the user's account. Unless returned to Memolink, Inc., Memolink.com will not be responsible for lost prizes due to an inaccurate address listed in members' accounts.
