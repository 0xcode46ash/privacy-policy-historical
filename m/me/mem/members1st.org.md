**Privacy Statement**  
Because information is an important part of our business, we understand the importance of the personal information you entrust to us. The following is the privacy statement of Members 1st Federal Credit Union and its affiliated companies that service or have contact with individual members. **Member Privacy Is Important To Us**  
At Members 1st FCU, we are committed to providing members with the finest products backed by consistent top-quality service. And while information is fundamental to our ability to do this, we fully recognize the importance of keeping members' personal and account information secure.

**Our Commitment to Security**  
Members 1st recognizes how important it is that sensitive information about our members remains confidential. We go to great lengths to safeguard the personal financial information they entrust to us.

We protect member information from unauthorized access, using established and thorough security standards, to ensure that account information remains secure.

We actively seek to verify the identity of our members through the use of Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) or other information before assisting them.

We are vigilant in the use of fraud protection measures (including keeping members' PINs, social security and/or Tax ID numbers in the strictest of confidence) in order to protect our members' privacy.

We permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper handling of member information, to have access to that information. Employees who violate our confidentiality policies are subject to strict disciplinary action.

We make every effort to keep member information files complete, up-to-date, and accurate. We regularly tell our members how and where to access their account information to verify its accuracy. When notified of an error, we promptly make the appropriate correction(s).
