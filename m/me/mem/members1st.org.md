# Members 1st Federal Credit Union - Privacy Statement

**Your Privacy**

|  |   
---|---|---  
  
Because information is an important part of our business, we understand how important it is to you to know what will happen to any credit or other personal information you give us.

Members 1st Federal Credit Union and its affiliated companies that serve individual members have adopted the following privacy statement: 

**Member privacy is important to us**  
At Members 1st FCU, we are committed to providing you with the finest products backed by consistently top-quality service. And, while information is fundamental to our ability to do this, we fully recognize the importance of keeping your personal and account information secure. **Our commitment to security**  
Members 1st recognizes how important it is that sensitive information about you remains confidential. We go to great lengths to safeguard the personal financial information you entrust to us.

We protect your identification from unauthorized access, using established and exacting security standards, to ensure that account information remains secure.

We actively seek to verify your identity through the use of Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) or other information before assisting you.

We take vigilant fraud protection measures (including keeping members' PINs, social security and/or Tax ID numbers in the strictest of confidence) in order to protect you.

We permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper handling of member information to have access to that information. Employees who violate our confidentiality policies are subject to disciplinary action.

**The information we collect  
**We collect and use member information - information from applications and from account usage, as well as information derived from other sources \- only to the extent needed to conduct our business and to meet our high quality service standards. We only obtain information in accordance with applicable laws and in response to your request for an account with us or for another legitimate business purpose.

We make every effort to keep your information files complete, up-to-date and accurate. We regularly tell you how and where to access your account information to verify its accuracy. When notified of an error, we promptly make a correction. **The information we share**  
We exchange member information, to the extent permissible by law, for the purposes of credit reporting, verification and risk management, but only with reputable reference sources and clearinghouse services.

From time to time, we may also allow other non-affiliated companies to offer products and services that may not be account-related but that we've determined to be of particular value to you. Whenever we hire other organizations to provide such services to you, however, we require them to conform to our privacy standards.

We never relinquish control over the confidentiality of your information for the purpose of these relationships or sell your individual member financial data \- such as personal buying habits or private details revealed on loan applications. The companies with whom we contract are not permitted to retain any information about you unless you have specifically expressed interest in their products or services.

**We respect members' personal privacy**  
Members may receive valuable product and service offers from us, from our affiliates, and other well-established companies. We carefully develop these offers to meet our standards and to assure that they reach members most likely to take advantage of the opportunity. To do so, we gather information that may indicate financing and investing preferences to create marketing and telemarketing lists.

At any time, you may contact us to remove your name from the mailing and telemarketing lists we utilize to keep you informed about products related to your account that you may find valuable in managing your finances. **To be removed from these lists**  
Send a request in writing to:
