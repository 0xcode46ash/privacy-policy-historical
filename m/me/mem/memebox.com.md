## What Personally Identifiable Information Does MemeBox Collect?

MemeBox collects the following types of personally identifiable information:

  1. User Provided Information: You may affirmatively provide MemeBox with certain personally identifiable information (such as your name and email address) when participating in various activities on the Website.
  2. Information Collected by “Cookies”: When you visit the Website, MemeBox may send one or more “cookies” to your computer. A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser, which MemeBox uses to help provide better service to you. Your browser has options to accept, reject or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. MemeBox may use cookies for many purposes, including (without limitation) to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Website, and to deliver content (which may include third party advertisements) specific to your interests.
  3. Log File Information: MemeBox’s servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit the Website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
  4. Information Collected by “Clear GIFs”: MemeBox may employ "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons), which are used to track the online usage patterns anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, MemeBox may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to users to track which emails are opened by recipients.



## How Does MemeBox Use Personally Identifiable Information?

Any personal information that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, through a User Submission, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you make a User Submission, and other users can contact you through messages and comments.

If you have not opted out from receiving emails from MemeBox, it may use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages. MemeBox also may use your email address for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Website changes or for customer service purposes). You cannot opt out of receiving emails for non-marketing or administrative purposes.

MemeBox uses aggregated information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Website and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends. In addition, MemeBox may use “cookies” clear gifs and log file information to deliver content (which may include third party advertisements) specific to your interests, and remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Website.

## Will MemeBox Share Personally Identifiable Information with Others?

MemeBox will not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

MemeBox may provide personally identifiable information to employees, consultants, affiliates or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on its behalf. In such circumstances, MemeBox requires that these parties agree to protect the confidentiality of such information and to comply in all respects with this Privacy Policy.

MemeBox may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Website.

In addition, MemeBox may release personally identifiable information: (i) to the extent it has a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with any applicable law, enforce any provision of the Terms of Use, protect itself against any liability, defend itself against any claims, protect the rights, property and personal safety of any user or protect the public welfare; or (ii) to respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.

## Third-party Advertisers

MemeBox may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Website. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Website. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. This Privacy Policy does not apply to them, and MemeBox cannot control their activities.

## Is My Information Secure?

MemeBox has implemented security measures to protect personally identifiable information collected on the Website against loss, misuse or alteration. In addition, your account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. It is important that you protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer. Moreover, despite the precautions described above, MemeBox cannot and does not guarantee that the individual user information you have transmitted will not be intercepted by others and/or decrypted or accidentally disclosed, and it accepts no liability for any unintentional disclosure.

## In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy

In the event that MemeBox is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, it reserves the right to transfer or assign the information it has collected from users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of MemeBox’s bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, MemeBox may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.

## Children’s Privacy

You must be 18 years and older to register to use the Website. As a result, MemeBox does not collect information about children.
