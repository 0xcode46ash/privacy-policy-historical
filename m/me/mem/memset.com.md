We may e-mail you from time to time regarding the services you have purchased or for marketing / promotional purposes.

We will give you the chance to refuse any marketing email from us or from another trader in the future with clear opt out instructions on mailings or contact details should they be received in any other manner.

The type of information we will collect about you includes:

  * your name
  * organisation
  * address
  * phone number(s)

We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent.

We reserve the right to pass on your personal information to any law enforcement agencies properly requesting it in connection with the commission of any offence once we are reasonably satisfied as to the circumstances surrounding the request.
