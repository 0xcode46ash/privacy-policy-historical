Use of Cookies

A cookie is a small data file that Web sites, when you visit them, often store on your hard drive. A cookie may contain information (such as unique user ID), which is used to track the pages of the sites you've visited.

MelissaAndDoug.com and our mobile sites use cookies to preserve the contents of your shopping cart between your visits. MelissaAndDoug.com and our mobile sites also use cookies to measure activity on our Sites, which allows us to determine which areas and features of our Sites are most popular. This information allows us to make improvements and updates to enhance your MelissaAndDoug.com and mobile experiences. Parts of the Sites, such as the members-only areas (for example, shopping) will not function if you do not have cookies enabled. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you turn off cookies or refuse them, though, you will not be able to make a purchase from the Site, nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information.

To enable or disable cookies on your browser, please consult your browser documentation or contact your software provider.

Security and SSL

Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the Site address will change from "http" to "https." Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you won't be able to connect to the server and therefore won't be able to place an order through a secure connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please print our shopping page and place your order by phone at (800) 284-3958.

Information Removal/Opt-Out

If you prefer not to receive marketing emails, SMS, MMS or Text Messages from MelissaAndDoug.com, our mobile sites or affiliate sites, please let us know by clicking on the unsubscribe link within any marketing email, SMS, MMS or Text Message you receive from us.

Children and Privacy

We are concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet, and understand that children may not understand all the provisions of our Privacy Policy or make informed decisions about the choices that are made available to adult users of the Site. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be familiar with the sites their children visit.

We will never request personally identifiable information from anyone whom we know to be under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a customer is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files.

Additional Information
