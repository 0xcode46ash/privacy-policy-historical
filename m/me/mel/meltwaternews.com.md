 Privacy Policy For Meltwater News US Inc.
Meltwater News is committed to satisfying your research/media needs while protecting your privacy.
We want all our clients to use our service safe in the knowledge that we are committed to their

submit any information to us.

When you visit this site your IP address is recorded. We use your IP address to help diagnose
problems with our server and to create statistical reports about usage. Your IP address is used to
help identify and to gather broader information about site usage that will not be tied to your

This site also uses "cookies", which are certain bits of information that are deposited on the hard
drive of your computer when you visit this site and sent back to this site when you visit again. We
use cookies to keep track of the number of users accessing our site and the information they access.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to notify you
when you have received a cookie, or alternatively, to refuse to accept cookies. However, you may

requested information and services to you and to help ensure that the information we provide to you
is relevant to your specific needs. We will not sell, trade, rent or lease your personal information to
others. However, if we sell or otherwise transfer all or a substantial part of our business to which
this site relates, your personal information may be considered to be an asset of our business and
may be sold or otherwise transferred to a third party as part of the sale or transfer of such business.
The acquiror’s own privacy policies will govern the use of your personal information from that
point forward.
When you purchase a service, your information will be stored on our system to complete the

us, but we will require those companies treat your personal information in accordance with this
policy. We also record information about your questions to us and your purchases so that we and
you can keep track of what you’ve asked about or ordered. Additionally, we may need to contact
you about your questions and/or your orders.
We use email addresses to send you the alerts you have requested, to answer the email we receive
and to communicate with you about publications and other services which you have told us you
would be interested in hearing about.

we will retain personal data for any minimum period required by applicable law.

variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal
information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
 Legal Disclaimer
Though we make reasonable efforts to preserve user privacy, we may in certain circumstances need
to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that
such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process
served on our Web site. We may also discloser personal information to (a) enforce our contractual
rights relating to the services we provide to you, (b) detect, prevent, or otherwise take action with
respect to fraud, security or technical issues, or (c) protect against potential harm to the rights,
property or safety of us, our employees or our customers.

The United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act took effect on April 21, 2000, and
imposes certain requirements on web sites. Our site is not directed toward children under age 13.
It is our policy not to collect or maintain personal information from any person under age 13. If we
learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information about any child under the age of 13,
we will make reasonable efforts to notify such child’s parent or guardian and erase such
information from our records.
