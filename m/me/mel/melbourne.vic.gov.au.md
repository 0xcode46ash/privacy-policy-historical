If you use your Facebook, Twitter, or other social networking sites ("SNS") account information to log in and/or authenticate with a City of Melbourne website (“CoM”), we will collect and store a unique user ID provided by your SNS.

Your SNS will provide CoM will a unique user ID which CoM can use to identify you on CoM websites.

## Collection and use of personal data

The City of Melbourne website only collects or records personal information you choose to provide through our Contact Us section, subscription to various eNewsletters, initiatives or programs updates and financial transactions. As part of our commitment to customer service, we may periodically invite you to provide feedback about your experience via a survey. Any survey is voluntary and you do not have to participate.

Where possible, you have the option of not identifying yourself when entering into a transaction with the City of Melbourne. However, there may be instances where this is not feasible. For example, there is no requirement for an individual to identify themselves if they just want to report an incident (eg a toilet block maintained by City of Melbourne requires cleaning). However, if an individual contacts the City of Melbourne because they want a new rubbish bin – we are unable to provide the new bin without knowing the person’s name and address.

City of Melbourne staff use personal information collected from email and survey sources to respond to individuals and discuss their particular enquiries. Survey results may also be shared with actioning areas within the organisation to evaluate and improve the customer service experience.

Email addresses and any other contact details you provide will not be added to mailing lists without your consent.
