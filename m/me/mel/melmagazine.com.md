MEL does not disclose personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  

Nonetheless, California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their personal information is shared with third parties or affiliated companies for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please contact us at: [Legal@melindustries.com](mailto:Legal@melindustries.com). You must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field. We are not responsible for notices that are not properly labeled or sent, or do not have complete information.

  5. **CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**



Protecting children’s privacy is important to us. We do not direct the Services to, nor do we knowingly collect any personal information from, children under the age of thirteen.  If MEL learns that a child under the age of thirteen has provided personally identifiable information through the Services, we will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from our files.

  6. **SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION  **



We use certain reasonable security measures to help protect your personal information. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You use the Services and provide us with your information at your own risk.  If we share information with a third party, as detailed in this privacy policy, we shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that they keep the information secure and only use the information consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

  7. **OTHER SITES  **



The Services may contain links to third-party websites, which may have privacy policies that differ from our own.  We are not responsible for the practices of such sites. 

The Services may also offer you the ability to interact with social plugins from social media sites, which may allow us and/or the social media site to receive data from or about you. In some cases, we may know that you clicked on a social plugin, such as a Twitter Follow button, or receive other information from the social media sites. Similarly, if you have previously provided personal information to a third-party operating a plug-in on the Services, then such third-party may recognize you on the Service. Your use of social network plugins is subject to each social media site’s privacy policy, which may be different from ours, so please read these policies carefully to understand their policies and your options. As with linked sites, we have no control over the information that is collected, stored, or used by social network plugins, and are not responsible for the practices of such sites. 

  8. **DATA STORAGE**



Your personal information may be stored on servers in the United States and is subject to the laws of the United States, where the data protection and other laws may differ from those of your country of residence. Your personal information may be disclosed in response to inquiries or requests from government authorities or to respond to judicial process in the countries in which we operate. 

  9. **CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY  **



Any changes we may make to our Privacy Policy will be posted on this page. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy.
