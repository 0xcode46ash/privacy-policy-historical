**Information Collection**  
When you browse the Melissa Data Web site, you do so anonymously. Personal information -- including your E-mail address-- is not collected. On certain pages, however, we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, including your E-mail address, name and billing address, for purposes such as newsletter sign up, making a purchase, using Lookups, or participating in beta tests, and online surveys. 

**Information Use**  
We may use information you have given us to provide a service, ensure proper billing, measure consumer interest in our various services and inform you about products and services. These offers may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us. We do not sell or share our customer information with outside sources. 

**Security**  
We use secure technology to keep your personal information-including your billing and account information-as secure as possible. Employees are educated about the importance of customer privacy, and we have procedures that limit employee access to personally identifiable information. 

**Credit Card Orders**  
When ordering through our Web site, all of your personal information and credit card details are encrypted before being transmitted to us across the Internet. None of your information is stored on our Web server or any other machine that can be accessed through the Internet. 

**Virus Free Downloads**  
We at Melissa Data go to great lengths to ensure that any product that you download from us is virus free. All our products are checked for viruses before we securely place them on our Web site.

**Changes to Privacy Policy**  
The Website Privacy Policy may be amended at any time, so please check back periodically.

**2\. APIs and Web Services Privacy Policy**

**Data Protection**  
We understand that your data is a valuable asset to your business, and we promise to keep your information secure and confidential. We safeguard data according to established industry security standards and procedures, and we continually asses new technology for protecting your information. 

**Data Collection**  
Melissa Data web service solutions collect only client IP address, customer ID and number of records processed as part of standard logging procedures. This information is used to track actual usage and compare with purchased tiers. We may occasionally enable a verbose logging mode on request from customers to capture request information used solely by our data quality engineers to troubleshoot technical issues. This information is seen on an as-needed basis by our engineers and then destroyed when the technical issue is resolved.

We do not sell or distribute any information submitted by a customer for data verification web services or processed through local data quality APIs. 

**Data Security**  
Our technology keeps your information safe. When you send us confidential or sensitive data using our site, your information is safe and secure. Every time you send us information, we mandate that a “secure session” first be established using Secure Socket Layer (SSL). After we receive your information, we process it on a secure server with firewalls.

**Changes to Privacy Policy**  
The Website Privacy Policy may be amended at any time, so please check back periodically.
