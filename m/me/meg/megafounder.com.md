# Megafounder. Privacy policy

We invite you to read this Privacy Policy: we want to ensure that you are aware of the terms you agree to before you start using any of our services.

This website is operated by Megafounder S. L (“Megafounder”) and the document you are reading contains the privacy terms for [www.megafounder.com](http://www.megafounder.com/) and any other service operated by Megafounder or redirected to this website (“the service”).

Megafounder takes the responsibility for processing your data very seriously, using it as you would yourself. By accepting these terms you are giving us your consent to collect and use your personal details, always in accordance with this privacy policy.

Megafounder reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy. We will always announce any changes we make, but it is your responsibility to check them regularly. If you continue to use the service, it is our understanding that you’ve accepted those changes.

**Data Collection.**

In agreement with Spanish Organic Law 15/1999, of 13th December, governing the Protection of Personal Data, we want you to know that all the data you supply us will be stored on a file, which is the property of Megafounder. This file is registered at the Spanish Agency for Data Protection that guarantees the security and privacy of your data. 

**Megafounder collects and processes the following information:**

  * Personal details: name, e-mail, address, telephone number, gender, country, profiles in social networks, etc.
  * Log-in information: user’s name and password.
  * Details needed for the transactions you would like to make through the service.
  * Any communication we may send you related to the service or its content: newsletters, invitations, information requests, etc.
  * Information you may provide on the service (for example, comments or contributions on the website or the projects), or which you may send us to inform us of any problem.
  * IP addresses.



The personal details you provide must be true and up to date, so if you have made any changes you must update your profile. You will be solely responsible for any direct or indirect damage or harm that wrong information may cause (false, incomplete or out-of-date data, for example).

If you wish to exercise your right to access, change, cancellation or opposition, just send us an e-mail to [hello@megafounder.com](mailto:hello@megafounder.com)

**Use of your personal data.**

**We will use the information you’ve provided us to:**

  * Identify you when you log into your account.
  * Provide you Megafounder services.
  * Send you information you’ve requested or that could be of interest to you.
  * Introduce projects that may be of interest to you when you’re using the service based on your location or your use of the service.
  * Administer your account in Megafounder.
  * Contact you for any question related to the service.
  * Analyze the use of the service to improve our contents and services.
  * For other purposes we will inform you about when we request the information.



It’s very important for you to be aware that the people responsible for each project (the "creators") will only have the e-mail and address of the founders when the project has reached the quantity requested. Creators will never ever have access to the financial details of the founders (their credit card details or the number of their bank account, for example).

**Communication: e-mail.**

We will always contact you by e-mail: we will send you one whenever you make a transaction with Megafounder, and others whenever necessary for the terms of service.

In exceptional cases, we will also send you other information, and you always have the option to stop receiving them. So don’t worry: we won’t be flooding your inbox with a lot of mails.

**Third party services.**

Your right to privacy is very important to us. That’s why Megafounder will never post anything by you on social networks or third party sites without your permission. Also, unless required in order to offer you the service, Megafounder will never give your name or personal details to third parties.

**Cookies.**

Cookies are small pieces of information that are issued to your computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the service. Megafounder uses cookies to help recognize you as a repeat visitor, to improve the quality of our service and to adapt the information to your needs.

**How do they work?**

Every time you use Megafounder our web server sends a cookie to your computer which allows us to recognize it; this way, we know which computer it is and how it uses our website, but we will never know who is using it or gather any kind of personal information (unless you are logged in).

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent this or to notify you each time a cookie is set. Nevertheless, by blocking or deleting cookies used on our Service, you may not be able to take full advantage of our service.

**Voluntary disclosure.**

Any personal information or content you disclose on the public areas of the service will be available to anybody, and it could be collected and used by other users. That’s why we ask you to be careful when disclosing that information because in such cases you will be held solely responsible.

We remind you that creators never have access to your credit card information or bank account details, even when their projects have reached the stage of requesting payment.

**Other terms.**

Megafounder reserves its right to facilitate your personal information if we are be legally required to do so, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to abide by the law.

If you wish to amend or cancel the personal information you’ve provided us, just log into your account and update your profile; we will automatically delete all your data from our system. In any case, we may have to store some of your personal details due to legal requirements.

The minimum age for using Megafounder services is 18 years old. For this reason, neither the Privacy Policy nor the Terms of use contain any reference to under-aged people. So if you’re under eighteen, talk to an adult before using the service.

The information you give us in order to provide you the service could be transferred to other countries (for example, to the server or to be used by Google Analytics). In all cases, we will take every step necessary to ensure your right to privacy remains fully protected.
