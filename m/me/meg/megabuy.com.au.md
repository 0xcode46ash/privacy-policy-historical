Hi just wanted to say, I have no idea why you guys have such bad reviews. I received my products within 3 days and the Macbook Pro was a 2 week wait but I expected that nothing would ship until after the huge sale! Awesome prices on everything. Couldn't have been happier.

Thanks again to everyone I was in contact with along the way!

  * Roger B - 24 Feb 12

Received in good order yesterday. Thankyou and congratulations to all your staff for TOP service. Will certainly recommend and use your services again. 

  * Geoffrey S - 29 Jun 12

Hello, Just to let you know that my computer monitor arrived yesterday. I am very pleased with it and I compliment your company's fast delivery time and professional service. I may purchase another monitor in the future for a spare as I desire a monitor with inbult speakers and most of the monitors available these days don't appear to have this feature. As for the BenQ monitor, I would recommend it highly for future purchasers.

Thanks Megabuy - great service!!! Ordered the item on Wednesday, it was here in Darwin on Monday, with a public holiday in between.  
Excellent prompt service, good price and realistic shipping charges (unlike others).

Well done.

I will deal with you again.

Regards  
Brad

Hi, I ordered my GS105AU switch from you guys over the phone. I just want to say how good the service was and how nice the customer service Representative was to me, even though i did not have the correct information I had at the time. So yeah, awesome service thank you Jack G! Sincerely, a returning Megabuy customer  


  * Peter M - 02 May 13

Hi, I just received my order and I am mightily impressed. The whole process from the minute I clicked onto your website for the first time yesterday right through to receipt of my item today was brilliant. I was especially impressed with your order confirmation process to ensure that my order placed using a gmail email address was in fact placed by me. I still cannot believe that I received delivery of my item in about 24hrs, though I dont know if I can hold you to that if I have to place another order :-) I will definitely recommend Megabuy to others and will use your services again in the future should the need arise. Again thank you so much for a brilliant purchase experience.  


  * Mite .T. - 08 May 13

Thanks for the ultra quick delivery guys. This is my first purchase from you guys, but definately wont be the last.. Very happy customer! 

  * U. Grebe - 22 May 13

Just letting you know was very impressed with service received. Was delivered in under 24 hrs well done. Thanks 

  * A. Karanwal - 31 May 13

Hi, Received it this arvo! Appreciate the super-quick delivery!!   
Shopped with you for the first time, inspite of the negative reviews on OzBargain, but I have no complains. Have passed on the good word and posted a link on my FB page too!  
Thanks,  


  * A.Walsh - 03 Jun 13

A BIG COMPLIMENT!!!

Late last Friday morning I ordered some software from you guys. I am in Canberra. At 11.45 this morning - Monday - it was delivered!  
Let me sum up:

1\. Best price I could find on what I was buying.  
2\. Only marginally less quick than if I had taken the trouble to go to a specialist store to buy it personally, and DEFINITELY faster than if I had bought from the developer on line.  
3\. A bonus of a local delveryman who, from experience, knew the vagaries of accessing where I live and made it simple (OK - you guys couldn't have organised that, but it was a nice and welcome extra)!

Simply put - this is my first Megabuy purchase. It is unlikely to be my last!  
Many thanks.

  * Lorraine H - 12 Aug 13

Thank you very much for your extremely efficient system. We received out order in record time. As we live in WA we are use to our orders taking a day or two longer than is written on websites but we couldnt fault your delivery time. It was super fast.  
We have ordered another product from another site who told us it would take 2-3 days and we actually ordered this before ordering from Mega Buy. We are still waiting! It is now 7 days and counting. We will be back to Mega Buy and will recommend your site without hesitation to others. Thank you.  


  * Dave - 29 Aug 13

Just wanted to give you the thumbs up for the product I recently bought. I bought a graphics card and it was delivered under 2 working days later! Pricing was competitive and service great! Will definitely be using MegaBuy again! 

  * Howard - 02 Sep 13

I am very careful buyer, especially when buying items online, I do a lot of research about the background of the sellers, and read reviews to get a good idea about the genuinity of the seller. I have bought many items from sellers, from around the world. So i talk with a conviction. I recently bought an item from "MegaBuy", and I can say for certain that this seller is one of the most genuine online sellers who handles sales in a very professional way.To anyone who is careful and not sure who to trust when buying from online, I can tell you with a conviction, buy from this seller "MegaBuy" , without having any fear of being 'ripped off'. The products are "Genuine", the packaging of the item are excellent, and everything is done in a professional way. "MegaBuy", Good on you , and keep doing the excellent good work. All the best to all at MegaBuy. You are all Awesome. 

  * Peter Wishart - 05 Sep 13

"Wow" Great Service I received my order this morning.  
I will look forward to my next megabuy purchase. 

  * Anthony Wardley - 11 Dec 13

Hi, I contacted you earlier, just letting you know Applecare has come through fine this morning. Thank you so much I really appreciate it. Loved the fast shipping and the pricing. Well done. 

  * George Oltvolgyi - 06 May 14

Thank you very much for your prompt, courteous and professional service.  
My Xtremkey turned up yesterday safely packaged and well within the anticipated timeframe.
