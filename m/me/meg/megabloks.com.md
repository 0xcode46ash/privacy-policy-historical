# Privacy Policy | Mega Brands

Effective Date: November 1, 2010

Last updated: July 11, 2014

 **Welcome!**

 **This Privacy & Cookies Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how MEGA Brands Inc. (“MEGA Brands”) and its affiliated companies (MEGA Brands Inc. and its affiliated companies are collectively referred to as the “MEGA Family”) collect, use and disclose your personal information. This Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services where this Policy is posted (collectively, the “Services”).** This policy also explains how we handle any personal information we collect offline. To learn specifically about our online information practices concerning children who are younger than 13, please scroll down to the section entitled "What information does MEGA collect from children under the age of 13?” 

Please review the information below to familiarize yourself with our policies on website privacy, so that you can take full advantage of all of the Services. Please remember that this site and the servers that make this site available are located in Canada. By using this site you agree to the transfer, collection, processing and use of data by this site as described in this Privacy Policy.

If you are under the age of majority in the state/province where you live, please be sure to read this policy with your parents or legal guardians and ask questions about things you do not understand. If you are under 13 you should get your parent’s or legal guardian’s permission before giving out your e-mail address or any personal information to us or to anyone else on the Internet. Even if you are over the age of 13, you should still get your parent’s or legal guardian’s permission before giving out any sensitive personal information (for example, date of birth, age, financial information, personal interests).

Our policy is to fully comply with applicable U.S. and Canadian privacy laws, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and the privacy guidelines of the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the U.S. Council of Better Business Bureaus. 

Note that our Privacy Policy applies only to the websites operated by the MEGA Family and not to other websites operated by other companies or organizations to which we may link, as we do not control the activities of those sites. Please note that the privacy and data collection practices of such third parties may differ from ours and such third parties may serve content and advertisements, collect information directly from visitors and place or recognize their own cookies on visitors’ browsers.  As such, we strongly encourage you to carefully review the privacy policy and terms of use of any website, online service or app that you visit, as MEGA Brands is not responsible for the actions of these third parties. 

## Who owns this website? How do I contact MEGA Brands regarding privacy?

This website is owned by MEGA Brands and is operated by MEGA Brands and/or members of the MEGA Family. The companies in the MEGA Family are the owners of the Mega Bloks®, ROSE ART® and MAGNEXT® trademarks and manufacturers of the MEGA Brands toys, activity and stationery items. The MEGA Family includes MEGA Brands America, Inc., MEGA Brands International and MEGA Brands Europe NV. If you have any questions concerning our privacy policies and use of children’s information or other user information, please write us at Privacy Officer, MEGA Brands Inc. at 4505 Hickmore, Montreal (QC) Canada, H4T 1K4, e-mail us at [privacy@megabrands.com](mailto:privacy@megabrands.com), or call us at 1-800-465-MEGA (6342). 

## Does MEGA Brands collect any personal information about me if I’m 13 or older? 

MEGA Brands doesn't require anyone to share any personal information about themselves in order to enjoy the Services. That means you can visit our sites and access most of the content and features we offer without any need to register with us. However, most of our sites contain special sections and privileges for members that register. We do not collect any personal information from you online or otherwise that you do not voluntarily provide, for instance when registering for newsletters, contests, sweepstakes, product updates, community areas, downloads, free demos or completing our online customer surveys. The personal information we request is usually limited to first and last name, mailing address, age, phone number and/or an e-mail address. 

## What personal information do you collect from children under the age of 13?

Just how important is children’s privacy to us? Plenty. In fact, we at MEGA Brands are committed to protecting the youngest and most impressionable members of our audience. This issue is vital to our mission of encouraging safe and healthy learning. That is why we follow the guidelines established by the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the U.S. Council of Better Business Bureaus. By promoting a trustful and secure environment, we can offer our youngest visitors a safe and enjoyable online experience. It's just the right thing to do. 

You can help by spending time online with your children and monitoring your children's online use. Please help us protect your child's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this site or any other without your permission. 

We do not collect personal information online or otherwise from children under 13 without consent of a parent or legal guardian except in special, limited circumstances described in this policy. Further, the Services do not enable children under 13 to make personal information publicly available.

When a child’s age indicates that he or she is younger than the age of 13, we take special precautions to protect his or her privacy. Specifically, if your child is under 13 and wants to use the Services to sign up for special features available only to registered members, including newsletters and/or access to online communities, he or she will be asked to provide us with your e-mail address so we can contact you and ask you to set up a Mega Bloks family account. 

Through your family account, your child under 13 will be able to participate in our online community and safely interact with other Mega Bloks fans in a monitored environment. In addition, through your family account, your child under 13 will also be able to access online games, contests and sweepstakes sponsored by MEGA Brands, add toys to a wish list, and more. 

Only you, and not your child under 13, will be able to edit your child under 13’s profile or change his or her account settings. You will also be able to revoke your child under 13’s access to use any Services requiring registration at any time.

We monitor and screen all messages originating from children under the age of 13 before they are displayed to other users of MEGA online communities so as to prevent children from disclosing any personal information about themselves to other users.

Children under 13 years of age may be permitted to participate in contests and sweepstakes sponsored by MEGA Brands. When your child enters a contest or sweepstakes, we will request your child to give us only his or her first name and/or screen name, province or state of residence and age. If we need more than this to enter your child in the contest, we will contact you at the e-mail address that you provide when you create your family account to notify you of this fact, explain what information we need and why, and ask that you (not your child) provide it. For example, we might ask you for your mailing address so that we can send to you, for your child, any prizes your child wins, or for your telephone number so that we can tell you when your child has won or to administer any skill testing requirement if required by law as a condition to awarding a prize. Any information you give us in the above special circumstances will be deleted from our database once the promotion, program or activity is concluded, and after any legally required period for keeping such information is complete. As permitted by COPPA, we reserve the right to collect the e-mail address of a child under the age of 13 for the sole purpose of responding directly on a one-time basis to a specific request from the child without providing the parental email notice described above. In these circumstances, we will not use the child’s e-mail address to re-contact the child and we will delete the child’s e-mail address from our records after responding to his or her request. As permitted by law, we also reserve the right to collect a child’s name and online contact information when we deem it necessary for the sole purpose of protecting a child’s safety, protecting the security or integrity of our websites or online services, taking precautions against liability, or responding to judicial process or a request from a law enforcement or public safety agency. 

## How does MEGA Brands use the personal information we collect?

We use the personal information we collect for the purposes indicated at the time that you provide such information or prior to use. For example, if you register in a contest, we will use the registration information to enter you in the contest and to notify you should you win the contest. Provided we have sought your consent to do so at the time we ask for information, we may also use the personal information you have provided to e-mail you or your child to regarding upcoming MEGA Brands products, website updates and promotional offers from us and/or our affiliates (namely, MEGA Brands America, Inc., MEGA Brands International and MEGA Brands Europe NV), including by means of direct marketing. We may also disclose your name and e-mail address to these affiliates so that they can send you promotional materials directly. If you want to stop receiving such updates and product information at any time, just follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each e-mail message you receive or contact us as described above. 

## Will MEGA share information it collects from me with others?

Except as specifically described in this policy, we will not sell, license, trade, rent or otherwise disclose personal information collected via the Services or from our customers to any company outside the MEGA Family. All of the Services operated by the MEGA Family may collect information from their visitors – personal as well as non-personal – for internal use within the different businesses of the MEGA Family and for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy. Any information we collect may be shared among companies that are part of the MEGA Family. 

In some instances, we may also need to transfer personal information about those using our Services or our customers to companies that we hire so that we may provide same with the best possible service - for example this might be a company that we have employed to fill product orders or coordinate mailings, contests or promotions or a reputable research company hired by us to conduct a survey of those using our Services or our customers. However, such companies will be under an obligation to keep confidential any personal information they receive about those using our Services or our customers and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy, and not to use such information for any purpose other than to perform the services we request. 

As permitted by law, we may also occasionally disclose personal information about those using our Services or our customers when disclosure is necessary to comply with law (for example, in response to a subpoena or court order), to comply with a specific request from a law enforcement agency, to enforce our Legal Notice, or to protect the rights, property or life, health or safety of visitors to our sites, our customers, the public, MEGA Brands or another company in the MEGA Family. 

Over time, we may buy or sell various assets or another company may acquire substantially all of the assets of MEGA Brands or of another company in the MEGA Family (or of one of our operating divisions). MEGA Brands reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession), lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance or financing of all or any portion of MEGA Brands or of another company in the MEGA Family, or of any of the business or assets or shares of MEGA Brands or of another company in the MEGA Family or a division thereof in order for you to continue to receive the same products and services from the third party. 

## What options do I have in response to a request for personal information?

You can supply the information or you can refuse to supply the information. You can also request the correction or deletion of personal information you have previously supplied to us by contacting us by regular mail to the attention of “Privacy Officer” at 4505 Hickmore, Montreal (QC) Canada, H4T 1K4, e-mail us at [privacy@megabrands.com](mailto:privacy@megabrands.com), or call us at 1-800-465-MEGA (6342).
