# Privacy Policy - MediaTek

Policy Overview

This privacy policy describes the information that MediaTek and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "MediaTek" "we," "our", "us" or the "Company") collects about you, how we use and protect this information, and the choices you can make about how we use this information. This policy applies to information, including Personal Information, collected about you by MediaTek in different methods, including via the [MediaTek.com](https://web.archive.org/en/) website.

 "Personal Information" means any information or set of information that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of MediaTek to identify an individual, such as the individual's name, address, email address, affiliated organization or company name, phone number, employer/profession or other specific types of personal information. Personal Information does not include information that is aggregated, anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public Personal Information.

MediaTek respects individual privacy and values the trust of its customers, employees, consumers, business partners and others.

  **How MediaTek Collects and Uses Personal Information**

You do NOT have to provide any personal information to us through the website. However, MediaTek may collect information about our customers, investors, business partners, vendors, job applicants, prospective employees and others in a variety of ways, including through personal contact, via our website and the internet, over the telephone, through correspondence with our employees and their attendance at industry events, when you use our products or services, when you apply for a job, and through third parties or other sources, where permitted by law. The personal information collected by us, or on our behalf, shall be limited to those details necessary for the purposes described below unless these are obvious to you or within your reasonable expectation. In general, we collect, use, and disclose information for the following purposes: to provide the products and services you request; to tell you about other products and services offered by MediaTek; to manage our sites and services; to administer and process any request for information or job application; to comply with our ethical, regulatory and legal obligations or requirements, including compliance with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process, or for the purposes of a government or regulatory investigation; or to protect or defend the rights or property of MediaTek.

In general, when browsing our website, you are not required to give us your Personal Information. However, MediaTek may collect, store, and/or use Personal Information such as your name, address,  work or business your work for,  phone number, email address, or other information, when you voluntarily submit it to us - for example, when you request information about our products or when you submit an employment application online. We may use this Personal Information to delete your requests for information or to contact you.

We rely on third-party service providers to perform a variety of services on our behalf. Examples include HR recruiting, an email service provider, and investor portals on our site. In so doing, we may need to share your Personal Information with them. We provide our service providers with only the Personal Information they need to perform their services and we require that they protect this information and not use it for any other purpose. Except under the circumstances described above, MediaTek will not share or disclose Personal Information to any third party for promotional purposes without your permission. In no even will MediaTek sell, rent, share, trade or disclose Personal Information to any third party without your permission.

In the event that we acquire an entity (such as through a merger or acquisition), we may use and/or disclose Personal Information of prospective employees to third parties in connection with the proposed transaction for the purposes of evaluating and/or performing the proposed transaction, and you consent to such disclosure. These purposes may include, for example, receiving advice on whether to proceed or continue with the transaction, fulfilling any reporting or audit requirements to such parties, and/or disclosing Personal Information as part of concluding a sale or transfer of assets. In the event a transaction is not concluded, we will require, by contract, any third parties not to use or disclose Personal Information in any manner whatsoever for any purpose, and to return or destroy such Personal Information.

  **Cookies and how we collect information**

Through our use of cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, local storage, or other similar technologies, MediaTek may automatically collect information relating to such matters as:

  * the total number of visits to this website,
  * the number of visitors to each page of this website,

  * the time spent on this website.



We may use this information, which is collected and remains in aggregate form, to understand how our visitors use this website so that we can provide you with a good experience when you browse our website, and also to improve the website. We may also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and for purposes of system administration. From time to time, we may share such aggregated information, which does not identify any individual, with our agents, business partners, consultants, or other third parties.

We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

Cookies are text files stored on a user's computer hard drive containing information about the user and are used by most major websites. Cookies can enable us to track the activity of our users to enhance their experience on this website and to deliver content specific to a user's interests. We may place a cookie in the browser file of your computer when you visit this website.

You may delete or block cookies by activating the setting on your web browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. Although you may still use this website without the cookie, some parts of the website may not work properly for you. Third parties also place cookies on our website and the data is only collected in the aggregate.

MediaTek is assessing available technology to respond to "do-not-track" browser signals; however, this website currently does not support those web browser settings.

We and our affiliates, analytics or service providers use technologies such as cookies, scripts, and tags to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregate basis. We also use software from Google Analytics for internal analytics that employs a software technology called "clear gifs" (which are also known as Web Beacons/ tracking pixels).

We use Google Analytics to collect information in an anonymous form about how visitors use the website, including the number of visitors to the website, where visitors have come to the website from, and the pages they visited. This information helps us better manage content on our website by informing us what content is effective.
