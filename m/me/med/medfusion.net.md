Medfusion (“Medfusion”) has created this privacy statement to demonstrate its commitment to privacy. The
following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for the following website:
www.Medfusion.net (“Site”). This Privacy Policy covers Medfusion’s treatment of personally identifiable and non-
personally identifiable information that Medfusion collects when users and visitors use this Site (“you”). Except as
otherwise required by law, this policy does not cover the practices of companies that Medfusion does not own or
control.
Information Automatically Logged
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer this Site. Your IP address is
only used to identify unique visitors when gathering statistics for number of visitors in a given period of time. For
each visitor to our Site, our server automatically recognizes only the end user's domain name, but not his or her
email address. We collect this information in our server logs and analyze the logs periodically for internal review
only. We make no attempt to track domain names back to individuals and store no information in our server logs
that would allow us to individually identify visitors to our site.
Cookies
We may save your Client ID and Password in a cookie so that we can verify that you have logged into our Site and
have the proper permissions to view the pages you have requested.
Personal Information
On a few areas on our Site, Medfusion may collect personally identifiable information to assist you with services
and technical support issues, online account access and payment, or when you register on our Site. In some areas we
may request personal information for verification against our records when users request a password online, or wish
to make changes to their client records. It is optional for you to receive services requiring such information.
Personal information may include, among other things, a user name, address, telephone number, and email address
or other Internet address.
The information you provide will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with
Medfusion. Agents or contractors of Medfusion who have access to your personal information are required to keep
the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing
for Medfusion. From time to time, we may disclose personally identifiable information to government entities when
such disclosure is required by law.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
In addition to personal information, Medfusion may also gather non-personally identifiable information, which may
be used by Medfusion. Generally, “non-personally identifiable information” means information that is collected
through “traffic data” and may entail the use of “cookies” or “IP addresses” to identify a computer or monitor how
or when a user accesses the Site or communications.
External Links
This Site contains links to other sites not operated by Medfusion. Medfusion is not responsible for the privacy
practices or content of websites it does not operate.
Consent
By using this Site, you consent to the collection, use and storage of your information by us in the manner described
in this Privacy Policy and elsewhere on the Site. We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy from
time to time. If this Privacy Policy changes in any way, we will place an updated version on this page. Regularly
reviewing this page ensures that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what
circumstances, if any, we will share it with other parties.
Security of Your Personal Information
Medfusion has implemented technology policies to protect personal information that we use from misuse and loss.
These policies are also designed to protect personal information from unauthorized access, modification and
disclosure. We will update these measures as new technology becomes available, as appropriate.


Privacy and Change of Control
In the event Medfusion goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or
selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
