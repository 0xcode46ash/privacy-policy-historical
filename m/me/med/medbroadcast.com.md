**OUR PRIVACY STATEMENT**  
At medbroadcast.com we are committed to protecting your privacy. Our goal is to make your online experience with us, easy, safe and secure. Wherever possible we allow you to give us as much or as little personal information as you feel comfortable providing. 

**Membership information**  
To browse through our health information content, we do not require you to provide any information. To use our unique health management tools or to post messages on our message boards, you do need to become a member. This requires you to enter your e-mail address, that you select a user name and password, and provide basic demographic information. The latter is used by us to tailor the site to our users needs, and is not shared with anyone else. 

The information you enter in "My Health Record" or "My Workbook" is password protected and can only be accessed by you, or by someone to whom you have given your user name and password. Medbroadcast.com cannot access this information through normal methods and does not use or maintain any information entered in these areas. This information is solely for your personal use. 

If you wish to change, remove, or review your membership information, simply log in, select the "change registration information" link and follow the instructions provided. 

**My Health Record**  
We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to ensure that your personal information is not accessible to any unauthorized party. 

Here is how it works:  
When you type in your personal information, medbroadcast.com establishes a secure connection with your browser so your information is ‘encrypted’, or scrambled, on a special server. This means that any third party that may view the message will not be able to read the information contained within it. All these processes take place behind a “firewall” which protects your information from unauthorized users such as hackers. 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a very small piece of text that is placed on your computer’s hard drive. The purpose of a cookie is to let us know when someone visits our website. This text, by itself, merely tells us that a previous visitor has returned; it doesn’t tell us anything about who you are, your e-mail address, or anything personal. 

Cookies help us evaluate how people use our site, what areas they frequent and what areas they don’t. In addition, cookies allow a web site to ask membership questions only once. As a result, the next time you return to the web site you will not need to enter membership information again. Cookies are incapable of doing anything to your hard drive. 

You can still access the information on our site if your browser is set to not accept cookies; however; if you wish to use My Health Record or other member services you will need to allow a cookie to be set, or access will not be granted. 

**Advertising**  
In order for us to provide health information at no charge, we display advertisements on our site. These are primarily in the form of rectangular banner or square button advertisements which are located on various pages of the site. We provide advertisers with general information about our audience which helps to provide advertisements that are relevant to the site. We do not, however, provide advertisers with any information about specific individuals. 

**The information we collect**  
We gather site usage information and traffic patterns to help us develop the design and layout of the site and to continuously improve your experience at medbroadcast.com. We may share aggregate, non-personal, statistical information regarding our customers and traffic patterns and site usage with our partners. Without your express permission, we will NEVER reveal your personal identity or preferences. 

To improve the design and layout of the site, we collect non-personal information such as IP address, ISP and Browser information. This is for internal use only, and we do not share it with any third parties. 

**e-mail**  
You may also decide to receive regular newsletters from us including updates and announcements about our health information content. You will only receive such communication if you specifically request it. You can do so by going to the Newsletter section on the home page and entering your e-mail address or selecting the “subscribe” link. To cancel your subscription, either select the “un-subscribe” link at the end of the newsletter or use the “subscribe” link from the home page and follow the instructions. 

If you elect to use our referral “send to a friend” service for informing a friend about our site, we ask for the friend’s name and e-mail address. medbroadcast.com will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. medbroadcast.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail. The friend may contact medbroadcast.com to request the removal of this information from the database. 

**Changes to the privacy statement**  
medbroadcast.com will notify its members by e-mail, of any changes to the privacy statement. Changes will also be posted on the “welcome back “ page, for returning members. 

**Links to other sites**  
We provide links to a number of other sites that we believe can offer you useful information and services. However, we are not responsible for the privacy policies of or any actions of any third parties that control the activities of such third-party sites.
