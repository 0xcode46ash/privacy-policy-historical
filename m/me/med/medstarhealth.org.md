# MedStar Health Notice of Privacy Practices

__

_Effective date: April 14, 2003_

This notice describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information. Please review it carefully. 

**Our Obligation to You**  
We value the privacy of your medical information as an important part of our "patient first" pledge. We are committed to protecting the privacy of your health information. We strive to use only the minimum amount of your health information necessary for the purposes described in this Notice.

We collect information from you and use it to provide you with quality care, and to comply with certain legal requirements. We are required by law to maintain the privacy of your health information, and to give you this Notice of our legal duties, our privacy practices, and your rights. We are required to follow the terms of our most current Notice. When we disclose information to other persons and companies to perform services for us, we will require them to protect your privacy. There are other laws we will follow that provide additional protections, such as laws related to mental health, alcohol and other substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS.

This Notice covers the following sites and people: all health care professionals authorized to enter information into your chart, all volunteers authorized to help you while you are here, all our employees and on- site contractors, all departments and units within the hospital, all health care students, all health care delivery facilities and providers within the MedStar Health system, and your personal doctor and others while they are providing care at this site. Your doctor may have different policies or notices about the health information that was created in his or her private office or clinic.

**HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE HEALTH INFORMATION  
Treatment:** We may use and disclose your health information to provide treatment or services, to coordinate or manage your health care, or for medical consultations or referrals. We may disclose your health information to doctors, nurses, technicians, medical students and other personnel who are involved in taking care of you. We may share information about you to coordinate the different services you need, such as prescriptions, lab work and x-rays. We may disclose information about you to people outside our facility who may be involved in your care after you leave, such as family members, home health agencies, therapists, nursing homes, clergy, and others. We may give information to your health plan or another provider to arrange a referral or consultation.

**Payment:** We may use and disclose your health information so that we can receive payment for the treatment and services that were provided. We may share this information with your insurance company or a third party used to process billing information. We may contact your insurance company to verify what benefits you are eligible for, to obtain prior authorization, and to tell them about your treatment to make sure that they will pay for your care. We may disclose information to third parties who may be responsible for payment, such as family members, or to bill you. We may disclose information to third parties that help us process payments, such as billing companies, claims processing companies, and collection companies.

**Healthcare Operations:** We may use and disclose your health information as necessary to operate our facility and make sure that all of our patients receive quality care. We may use health information to evaluate the quality of services that you received, or the performance of our staff in caring for you. We may use health information to improve our performance or to find better ways to provide care. We may use health information to grant medical staff privileges or to evaluate the competence of our health care professionals. We may use your health information to decide what additional services we should offer and whether new treatments are effective. We may disclose information to students and professionals for review and learning purposes. We may combine our health information with information from other health care facilities to compare how we are doing and see where we can make improvements. We may use health information for business planning, or disclose it to attorneys, accountants, consultants and others in order to make sure we are complying with the law. We may remove health information that identifies you so that others may use the de-identified information to study health care and health care delivery without learning who you are.

**Appointment Reminders and Service Information:** We may use or disclose your health information to contact you to provide appointment reminders, or to let you know about treatment alternatives or other health related services or benefits that may be of interest to you.

**Patient Directories:** We may keep your name, location in the facility, and your general condition in a directory to give to anyone who asks for you by name. We may give this information and your religious affiliation to clergy, even if they do not know your name. You may ask us to keep your information out of the directory, but you should know that if you do, visitors and florists will not be able to find your room.

**Individuals Involved In Your Care:** We may give your health information to people involved in your care, such as family members or friends, unless you ask us not to. We may give your information to someone who helps pay for your care. We may disclose information to disaster relief organizations, such as the Red Cross, so they can contact your family.

**Fundraising Activities:** We depend extensively on private fundraising to support our health care missions. We may use your contact information and the dates of your care, but not your treatment information, so that we may provide you with an opportunity to make a donation to our fund raising programs. If we do contact you for fundraising purposes, you will be told how you may ask us not to contact you in the future.

**Research:** We may disclose your health information for medical research that has been approved by one of our official research review boards, which has evaluated the research proposal and established standards to protect the privacy of your health information.

We will only disclose health information to someone reasonably able to help prevent or lessen the threat, such as law enforcement or government officials.

**Required by Law, Legal Proceedings, Health Oversight Activities, and Law Enforcement:** We will disclose your health information when we are required to do so by federal, state and other law.
