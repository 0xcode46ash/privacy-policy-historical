Advertisers, marketers, and website publishers use Mediaplex products – MOJO Adserver, MOJO Mail, and MOJO Publisher – to deliver and track advertisements and marketing messages over the Internet. Advertisements and communications sent through one of these Mediaplex products belong to the sender, with Mediaplex acting as the delivery agent. Mediaplex stores data received from these processes on behalf of our clients. Mediaplex does not retain, use, or sell the data collected for our own purposes other than for aggregate statistical reporting, such as the total client advertisements served or emails sent.

Mediaplex is dedicated to providing our products and services in a way that best assures the privacy of Internet Users. Mediaplex is a subsidiary of ValueClick, Inc., operating under the distinct privacy policies described below. 

In this privacy discussion, there are three parties: 

1.)    Mediaplex

2.)    Clients: Companies that use Mediaplex products, including MOJO Adserver, MOJO Publisher, and MOJO Mail to deliver advertising, marketing messages, and email over the Internet.

3.)    Internet Users: Computer users who receive email or use a browser to access websites.

Mediaplex markets MOJO Adserver and MOJO Publisher application service provider (ASP) products for advertisers and marketers to send advertisements to Internet Users. Advertising and marketing provide revenue for websites, the same way advertising subsidizes television, magazines, and newspapers.

Mediaplex does not collect personally identifiable information in the process of providing online advertising. Mediaplex does not know or retain personally identifiable information (PII), such as the names, telephone numbers, home addresses or email addresses of Internet Users to whom we deliver banner advertisements on behalf of our clients. The only personal information Mediaplex may have is the information an Internet User volunteers, such as in an email inquiry.

Mediaplex does collect general data on the performance of our advertising campaigns so we can provide aggregated results reports to Clients. This data may include the total number of advertisements delivered or the number of clicks resulting from banner advertisements. Mediaplex calculates the success of advertising campaign by correlating advertising results, such as a purchase made later on an advertiser’s website, by using cookie data. These results calculations are done anonymously. The user’s privacy is maintained while Mediaplex can report the campaign’s result to our Client.

## Cookies

A cookie is a small text file sent to your PC that lets Mediaplex identify your browser without violating your personal privacy. Mediaplex cookies do not contain personally identifiable information. Mediaplex uses cookies to the most effective advertising possible. For example, a cookie allows Mediaplex to ensure that you do not see the same ad over and over, ensuring delivery of diverse offers and promotions. 

## Web Beacons

A web beacon is an invisible 1x1 pixel GIF included in a Client web page. When the Internet User’s browser loads the Client web page, a request is sent to Mediaplex for the 1x1 clear GIF, signaling that the page was displayed. Using the cookie, Mediaplex can then correlate that the same anonymous Internet User saw or clicked an ad, and subsequently visited the Client’s web page, and can report a correlation back to the Client.
