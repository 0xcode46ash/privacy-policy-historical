# Online Marketing & Internet Advertising - Mediaplex Media Services

  
last updated 8/29/01

Mediaplex is the leader in providing advertising technology that protects Internet users’ privacy. Our mobile Java objects architecture was designed in anticipation of privacy concerns, and was engineered from the ground up to be compliant with the world’s most stringent privacy standards. For this reason, we do not maintain, share or sell any personally identifiable data or anonymous user profile information.

We have always contended that the significant portion of the focus of online advertising campaigns should be on the advertiser’s business information rather than reliance on a viewer’s profile. Our company is built on a proprietary technology called MOJO (for mobile Java objects) that can dynamically configure ad messages based on an advertiser’s internal data, such as pricing and inventory levels, for the products or services they are promoting online. As a result of this focus, we use non-personally identifiable information provided by the Web sites, pursuant to their privacy policies, about their viewers’ general demographics and interests in order to target appropriate advertising to the sites.

In addition, if our clients have databases of their customers, we can use this data on behalf of those clients, again pursuant to their privacy policies. The premise is that both the site providing the ad space and the advertiser (1) have a relationship with the customer, (2) have an opportunity to share their privacy policy with their customers, and (3) provide an opportunity to opt out. As a third-party ad server, Mediaplex does not always have a relationship with the user, and therefore it would be inappropriate to build user profile information when such a relationship does not exist.

Strict Anonymity  
Other than instances where we have a relationship with a Web user, Mediaplex does not know or maintain the names, telephone numbers, home addresses or email addresses of Internet users to whom we deliver banner advertisements on behalf of our clients. We collect data for reports on clients’ campaign performance (e.g., aggregate number of impressions delivered, number of click-throughs, etc.) to enable Mediaplex and our clients to analyze and optimize their online campaigns. For general reporting purposes on Mediaplex’s overall ad serving performance and capacity, we may report the total number of advertisements delivered on behalf of all clients for a specific time period, with no reference to individual clients or campaigns. 

Client Website Privacy Policies  
Our clients retain the sole and exclusive right to use any data, which they have obtained through explicit permission from an Internet user, for example, if a customer provides an email address to receive information and updates. We rely on our clients' consumer privacy policies, as well as the privacy practices of the publisher sites included in each campaign.

We urge consumers to check the privacy policy of a site before they do business with that site regarding:

  1. What personal information is collected about a Web user
  2. How that information is used
  3. With whom the information may be shared
  4. What options are available to Web users regarding the accumulation, use and distribution of the information
  5. What security procedures are in place to protect the data
  6. How a Web user can correct inaccuracies in the data

Mediaplex MOJO Mail Privacy Policy  
**MOJO Mail is Mediaplex's Opt-In email Program**  
Mediaplex is a leading provider of advertising technology that deeply respects and strives to protect Internet users' privacy. Our mobile Java object (MOJO™) architecture allows marketers to dynamically configure and customize outbound email messages at the time the email is opened, thereby ensuring communication of timely, relevant content and offers based on up-to-the-minute business data such as price, inventory levels and customer purchasing history. This technology enables our clients to provide the most current information and offers to their customers and prospective customers who have opted-in to receive promotional and other communications.

**MOJO Mail Requires Consent**  
Mediaplex's MOJO Mail is an opt-in email product used only to deliver email to Web users who have opted-in to receive promotional offers through an online relationship-marketing program. Mediaplex's client contracts require that each client comply fully with Mediaplex's privacy policy and specifically with the MOJO Mail opt-in requirement. Mediaplex does not send, participate in or condone the use of unsolicited commercial email (commonly referred to as "SPAM"). 

**Type of Information used by Mediaplex's MOJO Mail**  
Our advertisers provide us with Web user information such as a name, email address, and other information that has been provided, on an opt-in basis, by the Web user to the advertiser, or through an accredited email list provider for the purpose of sending email communications. Additional data can include information on transactions that the participant has made with the advertiser. The purpose of this data is to help the advertiser provide relevant, targeted messages and offers to customers who have opted-in to receive such messages.

**Use of this information by Mediaplex**  
Mediaplex uses the opt-in email addresses that it receives from its clients or collects on behalf of clients to send client communications, including product updates, discounts and other pertinent information to the opt-in participants of our clients' email initiatives. Any available information about the participants' interests or previous purchases can be used to personalize the email. Mediaplex does not share, sell or otherwise use Web user profile data in any manner other than intended by the Web user and our clients.

**Optimization of campaign performance**  
We collect data for the purpose of reporting clients' campaign results (e.g., aggregate number of emails delivered, number of click-throughs, etc.) and to enable Mediaplex and our clients to analyze and optimize their MOJO Mail campaigns. For general reporting purposes on Mediaplex's overall serving performance and capacity, we may report the total number of emails delivered through our system on behalf of all email clients for a specific time period, with no reference to individual Web users, clients or campaigns. 

**Security of the MOJO Mail program**  
Mediaplex may store the data associated with clients' MOJO Mail campaigns at our data centers. We have strict security measures to ensure that the data is not lost, shared, sold or in any other way misused. Access by Mediaplex staff and clients is password-protected and limited to certain individuals.

**Email and children**  
Our clients must ensure that they will comply with all laws and regulations concerning any email addresses that are protected by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). If our clients have email programs for children under 13 years old, the clients must guarantee that they have verifiable, parental consent that is in full compliance with COPPA regulations.

**We urge consumers to check the email privacy policy of a company before they participate in that company's program regarding:**

  * What personal information is collected about a Web user 
  * How that information is used 
  * With whom the information may be shared 
  * What options are available to Web users regarding the accumulation, use and distribution of the information 
  * What security procedures are in place to protect the data 
  * How a Web user can correct inaccuracies in the data 



**You may opt-out of a client's MOJO Mail program at any time**  
Mediaplex believes that it is paramount for participants to have the opportunity to opt-out of opt-in email programs at any point in time. 

A Web user may opt-out of the MOJO Mail opt-in email program in either of two ways:

  * Follow our client's opt-out procedures which are posted on the client's Web site 
  * Provide notification of his/her wish to opt-out of the client's program by clicking on the unsubscribe link that it placed at the bottom of every MOJO Mail email.
