# Medical Information, Forums And Communities

An ancient precept in the field of medicine says, _"Primum non nocere",_ or "First of all, do no harm."

Med Help is dedicated to protecting the privacy of our visitors and to ensuring that our information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. To be useful we must gain and earn the trust and confidence of our members and visitors. Therefore, with the help of the Med Help membership, we strive to maintain the highest possible level of integrity. Our principals are based on the best codes of practice and ethical standards. We invite suggestions on how we can do better.

We understand that health is a very personal subject and we want our Members and Visitors to be as comfortable as possible while visiting our website and using our services.  This policy tells you, among other things, what information we gather from you, how we may use or disclose that information and our efforts to protect it.

We will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without parental consent.

Participation on our site is purely voluntary and you may **_opt-out_** at any time by notifying us via an email message to [ unsubscribe@medhelp.org](mailto:unsubscribe@medhelp.org). Upon receipt of your request to "opt-out", we will remove you from all future mailings and not contact you.  In addition, we will not send unsolicited messages to users of our site who indicate that they do not wish to receive such messages. If you do not wish to receive unsolicited email messages from us, please   
[ contact us](https://web.archive.org/ContactUs.htm).

We have structured our websites so that, in general, you can visit Med Help on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information if you so choose. Your access may be limited to browsing and searching our medical libraries.

Please remember that any information (including personal and medical information) that you reveal in a public forum (such as a medical forum, bulletin board, mail list, chat room/event) is not subject to this Privacy Policy and will be seen by third parties not related to Med Help and our subsidiaries and may be used by them to contact you or for unauthorized purposes. Also, if you leave our site via a link to a third party site, any information you reveal on that site is not subject to this Privacy Policy -- you should consult the privacy policies of each site you visit.

**_Security_**

Security is a matter of protecting data from unintended use, loss, misuse, counterfeit, and accidental or unauthorized alteration. It extends from data collection through storage, retrieval and processing through transmission. It includes backup and recovery procedures. We have installed a number of security measures to protect the confidentiality of your personal information. These include:

  * Your personal information lives in a separate database that is not available on the Internet. 
  * We use industry-standard encryption methods when transmitting credit card information over the Internet. 
  * You are identified on our website by your **Member or Nickname** and **Password** only. 



However, please remember that you play an important part in security as well. Your password should never be shared with anyone and should be changed frequently. Remember that any information you voluntarily disclose on-line in any news or message postings, discussion groups or chat rooms may be collected and used by others without your permission. Furthermore, if you provide any information to parties who operate Web sites that are linked to or from our site, different rules may apply to their collection, use or disclosure of your personal information. We encourage you to review these sites' policies before revealing any sensitive or personal information. 

Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk. 

**_IP Addresses_**

An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. We collect IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, report aggregate information to sponsors and advertisers, and to conduct site analysis. If a visitor requests pages from Med Help, the Med Help servers enter the visitor's IP address into a log. To maintain visitor anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information. 

**_Third Party Advertising_**

Sponsors, partners or advertisers on our site may also use their own cookies when you click on their advertisement or link to their site or service, or even if the advertisement simply appears on a page that you are viewing. Third party advertisers are used to serve their ads on our site and these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect non-personal information through the use of cookies. We do not control these third parties' use of cookies, or how they manage the non-personal information they gather through them.  You should review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or link to from our site to understand how these other sites use cookies and how they use the information they collect through the use of cookies on their own sites. Med Help explicitly identifies sponsors and advertisers on our site as much as is possible.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please [ contact us](http://www.medhelp.org/ContactUs.htm)

**_Changes to this Privacy Policy_**

It may be necessary from time to time for us to modify this policy to reflect changes in the way we collect and use information or changes in privacy-related laws, regulations, and industry standards. Accordingly, we reserve the right to change this policy at any time by posting the revised policy on this web site. Please visit this site frequently in order to be informed of any such changes. This policy was posted on November 8, 2006.  Data will be handled in accordance with the policy in effect at the time the data is collected.
