# Media UK: tv, radio, newspapers and magazines; contacts, news and discussions

Media UK takes your privacy very seriously. Here, we explain what information we get from you, and what information we use. 

_This was last updated 4 November 2005; graphical reworking only. No changes since July 2004._

### Webservers and automatically-captured information

Media UK runs www.mediauk.com. This automatically collects information about which pages are visited, browsers used, the domain name (e.g., aol.com) of visitors, and information about where the user has come from. We use this to dynamically write the site so that it's relevant to you, and we also use it for internal review and for traffic audits. 

### Cookies

To help your surfing experience, Media UK uses cookies. Cookies are small files which help identify you to us when you ask for pages from our site.   
In the Media UK cookie, which is available to all servers on the Media UK domain, we keep your userid, username, e-mail address, password, plus your session id, player preferences, and time of your last visit.   
You can see this information in your cookies directory: it will be called (your computer login name)@mediauk[1].txt   
If you do not accept cookies, you can still use the site, though access to some areas may be curtailed. 

### Email addresses and personal details

To passively use our site, we do not need your e-mail address.   
The Media UK discussion area is protected by a username and password, which is activated through e-mail. To use these services, you must supply us with a valid e-mail address.   
We may use the e-mail address you have given us to e-mail you limited, low-traffic, information, not exceeding two e-mails a calendar month. To unsubscribe from these messages, please request closure of your account. 

When giving us feedback, in order for us to give you a reply we need your e-mail address. We also, generally, ask for your name. Both of these pieces of information are not required, obviously if you do give us them, then we know who you are!   
We hold IP details for your discussions account.   
When using the contact-us function, your full e-mail address will not be seen by Media UK staff: only the site administrator has access. 

### Release of personal details

By posting messages which could be considered as defamatory or libellous under English law, you are putting both yourselves and Media UK at risk. We reserve the right to release all available details to aid identification in case of legal action. We will not disclose them at any other time, and you will be notified if we wish to release them, and given every reasonable opportunity to settle the matter without recourse to release of information.   
**YOU CANNOT USE MEDIA UK TO POST LIBELLOUS, DEFAMATORY OR OTHERWISE ILLEGAL POSTINGS.**

### Advertising

Our advertising is supplied by Google AdSense. They have a separate privacy policy which you may wish to review. 

### Agreement

By using this site, you signify your assent to this policy, and also to our copyright restrictions. If you do not agree, please do not use the site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
