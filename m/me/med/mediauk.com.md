# Privacy Policy

_This was last updated December 2012, adding details of use of LinkedIn and Media UK Accounts._

**Data Protection Act 1998 (UK)**   
This website is hosted in the UK, and run by [Not At All Bad Ltd](http://notatallbad.ltd.uk/). Not At All Bad Ltd is registered in the UK under the Data Protection Act 1998. Our registration number is Z1084808. Our Data Controller is James Cridland - you can contact him at james.cridland@mediauk.com. 

**Webservers and automatically-captured information**   
Not At All Bad Ltd runs the server that hosts www.mediauk.com. This website automatically collects information about which pages are visited, browsers used, the domain name (e.g., aol.com) of visitors, and information about where the user has come from. We use Google Analytics to assist us, who have a separate privacy policy: no personally-identifiable information is kept by Google Analytics. 

**Cookies**   
To help your surfing experience, this site uses cookies. If you do not accept cookies, you can still passively use the site. This cookie is essential, however, if you want to log in. Our [cookies](https://web.archive.org/cookies) page details what cookies we use and what they contain. 

**Email addresses and personal details**   
To passively use our site, we do not need any personal information. 

To get Media UK email alerts, you must supply us with a valid e-mail address: we check this is valid before using it. When logging in to our site via a third party like Facebook, Google or LinkedIn, if you grant permission we get personal information from your account provider with your name, email address, and other basic information, including a photograph where you have this set. We copy this information using a secure link between our website and theirs; and update it every time you log in. We don't store your password. 

When creating a Media UK Account, we require a valid email address, and we also ask for your real name and a password. We store the password encrypted in our database, using a relatively slow encrypting mechanism. 

In all of the above cases, we may use the e-mail address you have given us to e-mail you important information regarding your account and new services by Media UK, not exceeding one e-mail a calendar month. These messages have a clear unsubscribe link where appropriate. We never share your details with any third party. 

When giving us feedback, in order for us to give you a reply we need your e-mail address. We also ask your name. Both of these pieces of information are not required. Your full e-mail address will not be seen by Media UK staff: only the site administrator has access. 

**Email lists, unsubscribing, and measures against spam**   
Media UK never sends [spam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28electronic%29). 

Our email alerts and Media UK Accounts require a valid email address. You will be asked to check your email address and click on a URL we send you to ensure you're posting from a valid email address and that you have access to that email address - or you'll need to log in using a third party (like Facebook) which has already verified your email address. This is called [confirmed opt-in](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt_in_e-mail), and universally recognised as best practice. 

Our daily email alerts come from alerts+(....)@mediauk.com (each email address is different to identify and remove bounces and other problematic addresses). We want to make it easy to unsubscribe from these daily emails. Every one contains clear unsubscribe links. These trigger an 'unsubscribe' link in systems like Gmail and other email services, which we honour. Administrative and discussion alert emails come from admin@mediauk.com, and similarly have unsubscribe links at the bottom where appropriate. 

To protect the health and reputation of our service, and ensure that all user details are correct, we monitor and agressively remove bouncing email addresses. If your email address bounces, your account or alerts may cease without warning or notification. 

While a UK company, we abide by the principles of the US 'CAN-SPAM' laws, and comply fully with the EU Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC. We do not give any of your information to any third party without your consent. 

**Release of personal details**   
We do not give your details to any third party without your consent. However, by posting messages which could be considered as defamatory or libellous under English or European law, you are putting both yourselves and this website at risk. We reserve the right to release all available details to aid identification in case of legal action. We will not disclose them at any other time, and you will be notified if we wish to release them, and given every reasonable opportunity to settle the matter without recourse to release of information. 

**Advertising**   
Our advertising is supplied by Google AdSense. Both companies use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit this website, and use cookies. These companies may use your visiting behaviour on this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you (rather than just giving you irrelevant advertising). Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet. You can read more about this, and opt out of this cookie, by visiting [Google's privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

**Information held, and EU regulations**   
This website is hosted in the EU by Amazon Web Services. Email to @mediauk.com, and some feedback from the website, is held on Google's email servers, which are both inside and outside the EU. 

**mediauk.net**   
The website at www.mediauk.net is stored on Amazon S3 and Amazon Cloudfront. We do not collect logfiles for this service. All other services accessed through these pages have their own privacy policies which are linked clearly from all pages. 

**muk.fm**   
The short-link server at muk.fm is governed by these privacy policies. It uses no cookies, nor Google Analytics, and contains no advertising. This website automatically collects information about which pages are visited, browsers used, the domain name (e.g., aol.com) of visitors, and information about where the user has come from in the form of logfiles, which are regularly erased. 

***.mediauk.com and *.muk.fm**   
Subdomains of mediauk.com (except www.mediauk.com) and *.muk.fm are stored on Amazon S3 and Amazon Cloudfront, and are used to store static files. They use no cookies, nor Google Analytics. We do not collect logfiles on these domains. 

**Agreement**   
By using this site, you signify your assent to this policy, and also to our copyright restrictions. If you do not agree, please do not use the site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
