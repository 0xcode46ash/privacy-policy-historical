# Privacy Policy, and terms of use - Media UK

Media UK takes your privacy very seriously. Here, we explain what information we get from you, and what information we use. 

_This was last updated 23 May 2008: adding information about third party ad vendors as requested by Google AdSense. There have been no material changes since July 2004._

### Data Protection Act 1998

Media UK is run by Not At All Bad Ltd, which is registered under the Data Protection Act 1998. Our registration number is Z1084808. Our Data Controller is James Cridland, who you can contact at james.cridland@mediauk.com. 

### Webservers and automatically-captured information

Media UK runs www.mediauk.com. This automatically collects information about which pages are visited, browsers used, the domain name (e.g., aol.com) of visitors, and information about where the user has come from. We use this to dynamically write the site so that it's relevant to you, and we also use it for internal review and for traffic audits. We use Google Analytics to assist us, who have a separate privacy policy: no personally-identifiable information is kept by Google Analytics. 

### Cookies

To help your surfing experience, Media UK uses cookies. Cookies are small files which help identify you to us when you ask for pages from our site. 

In the Media UK cookie we keep your userid, username, e-mail address, password, plus your session id, player preferences, and time of your last visit. Google Analytics also stores information here to assist in its analysis. 

If you do not accept cookies, you can still use the site, though access to areas requiring registration won't work. 

### Email addresses and personal details

To passively use our site, we do not need your e-mail address. 

Media UK registrations are protected by a username and password, which is activated through e-mail. Media UK email services (like our jobs or news alerts) are activated through email. To use any of these services, you must supply us with a valid e-mail address. 

We may use the e-mail address you have given us to e-mail you important information regarding your account and new services by Media UK, not exceeding one e-mail a calendar month. To unsubscribe from these messages, please request closure of your account. 

Discussion services store your IP address next to each posting you make, for our review only. 

We do not give any of your information to any third party without your consent. 

When giving us feedback, in order for us to give you a reply we need your e-mail address. (and we also ask your name). Both of these pieces of information are not required. You should also know that your full e-mail address will not be seen by Media UK staff: only the site administrator has access. 

### Email lists, unsubscribing, and measures against spam

Media UK never sends [spam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28electronic%29). 

Our daily email alerts, discussion registrations and job postings all require a valid email address. You will be asked to check your email address and click on a URL we send you, to ensure you're posting from a valid email address and that you have access to that email address. This is called [confirmed opt-in](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt_in_e-mail), and universally recognised as best practice. 

We want to make it easy to unsubscribe from our daily email alerts. Every one contains an unsubscribe link at the bottom, and a further unsubscribe link in the List-Unsubscribe header, conforming with RFC2369. 

To protect the health and reputation of our service, and ensure that all user details are correct, we monitor and agressively remove bouncing email addresses. If your email address bounces, your subscriptions to our email alerts, or discussion membership, may cease without warning or notification. 

While a UK company, we abide by the principles of the US 'CAN-SPAM' laws, and comply fully with the EU Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC. We do not give any of your information to any third party without your consent. 

### Release of personal details

By posting messages which could be considered as defamatory or libellous under English law, you are putting both yourselves and Media UK at risk. We reserve the right to release all available details to aid identification in case of legal action. We will not disclose them at any other time, and you will be notified if we wish to release them, and given every reasonable opportunity to settle the matter without recourse to release of information.   
**YOU CANNOT USE MEDIA UK TO POST LIBELLOUS, DEFAMATORY OR OTHERWISE ILLEGAL POSTINGS.**

### Advertising

Our advertising is supplied by Google AdSense. Google AdSense uses some third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit this website. 

These companies may use your visiting behaviour on this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. For more information, see Google's privacy policy. 

### Information held, and EU regulations

Email to @mediauk.com is held on Gmail (admin@); other @mediauk.com addresses forward to email addresses held on a variety of systems. 

### mediauk.net
