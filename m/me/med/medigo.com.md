# Terms and Conditions - MEDIGO Medical Travel

##### General Terms and conditions for the use of MEDIGO's website

Last updated: 30 January, 2014

Welcome to the website of MEDIGO and thank you for using our services (" **Services** "). The Services are provided by MEDIGO GmbH (hereinafter " **MEDIGO** "), Rosenthaler Stra√üe 13, 10119 Berlin, Germany. 

By using our Services, you as the user (" **User** ") are agreeing to these General Terms and Conditions the " **Terms** ". Please read them carefully.

Some of our Services are subject to additional terms. Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services and those additional terms become part of your agreement with MEDIGO if you use those Services.

  1. ##### 1. Scope of MEDIGO's Services

  2.     1. 1.1.

MEDIGO provides information about medical services in Germany and abroad on its website. The User can see profiles of medical service providers (hereinafter " **Providers** ") on that website. The Providers alone are responsible for the content, accuracy and updating of these profiles. MEDIGO is not obligated to and does not check the profiles.

    2. 1.2.

The information provided on MEDIGO's website including the information provided by the Providers and other third parties cannot replace a medical consultation or a medical examination. The information shall not be used to independently decide whether to commence or terminate a medical treatment.

    3. 1.3.

The User is furthermore permitted to contact Providers. MEDIGO only provides the platform for this purpose. For this purpose, it is necessary to collect, process and use personal data and a special category of personal data in the meaning of the German Federal Data Protection Act ( _BDSG_ ) which requires the prior consent of the User. The User can select Providers and enquire about medical services using a pre-prepared form. MEDIGO is not involved in contractual relationships between Users and Providers and also in no way influences the conclusion or the content of the contracts. MEDIGO does not assume any rights, obligations or liabilities vis-a-vis the User out of a contract concluded between a Provider (or another third party) and the User. 

    4. 1.4.

Certain types of forums are set up on MEDIGO's website enabling the User (i) to provide information in order to review the services of Providers and to exchange experiences and opinions with other users, (ii) to evaluate Providers by way of a rating system and (iii) to give recommendations to MEDIGO, other users or Providers. Contributions reflect personal perceptions, experiences and assessments of the Users. Only when MEDIGO becomes aware or is made aware by third parties of a contribution that is not permitted by law or which is not in accordance with MEDIGO's policy regarding fairness in dealing with business partners, the respective contribution will be deleted.

**The User agrees to the long-term storage and publishing of his or her contributions made in forums.**

    5. 1.5.

The use of MEDIGO's website and the Services thereon is free-of-charge for the User.

    6. 1.6.

The User is entitled to set up a user account containing his or her personal data for using the Services. For this account, the Privacy Policies apply. The User may terminate the account at any time. In compliance with the Privacy Policies MEDIGO will delete or block the personal data and specific personal data of the User as soon as the User has terminated the account. However, for the purpose of being able to trace and document the history of inquiries of the User or Providers in the event of any legal disputes related to Providers contacted by the User via MEDIGO's platform, MEDIGO will keep the first and the last name of the User and his or her email address. MEDIGO will not use this data for any other than the aforementioned reason, in particular not for any promotional purposes, after the termination of the user account.



  1. ##### 2. User's Obligations

  2.     1. 2.1.

The User is obligated to protect login data (user name, password) carefully and against unauthorised access by third persons. The User alone is responsible for all activities on or through his or her account. The User shall inform MEDIGO immediately if he or she has knowledge of an unauthorized use of his or her account or of any other security risk. 

    2. 2.2.

The User shall only provide true and up to date information to MEDIGO, Providers or other third persons on this website or in connection with Services rendered by MEDIGO. 

    3. 2.3.

The User shall only rate services of Providers or other third persons that he or she has personally used. The User is prohibited from making any ratings or contributions in a user forum provided by MEDIGO, if they contain untrue facts, are defamatory or if they are not permitted by law (e.g. because they are of an abusive or disparaging nature). 

    4. 2.4.

In the event of a violation of User's obligation pursuant to clauses 2.2 and 2.3, MEDIGO is entitled to delete the respective information and contributions and - while taking into account the relevant User's legitimate interests - to block the User's account temporarily or permanently.

    5. 2.5.

If a claim is made by a third person against MEDIGO due to a culpable violation of User's obligation pursuant to clauses 2.2 and 2.3, the User is obligated, upon the first written request, to indemnify MEDIGO against third parties' claims as well as against costs which may be incurred by MEDIGO as a result of an appropriate legal defense (e.g. court and lawyers' fees). The right to claim further damage compensation remains unaffected.



  1. ##### 3. Liability of MEDIGO for own services

  2.     1. 3.1.

Other than as expressly set out in these Terms or additional Terms, MEDIGO does not make any promises or quality declarations about the Services rendered by it and does not grant any guarantees regarding those Services. 

    2. 3.2.

MEDIGO is liable without limitation in the event of deliberate act or gross negligence. MEDIGO is likewise liable without limitation in the event of a negligent breach of a duty, insofar as claims arising from injury to life, body or health are at issue.

    3. 3.3.

In addition, MEDIGO is only liable in the event of simple negligence if a material contractual duty has been breached. Such a material duty, which endangers the performance of the purpose of a contract, is involved if the orderly execution of the contract is only possible by fulfilling the respective duty and if the User may routinely trust that those duties will be filfilled. The User's claim for damages in the event of a breach of material duties on the basis of simple negligence is, however, limited to damages that are foreseeable and typical for this type of contract.

    4. 3.4.

MEDIGO's liability due to a deliberate act to deceive or a granted guarantee remains unaffected.

    5. 3.5.

Clauses 3.1 to 3.4 shall also apply to MEDIGO's legal representatives, employees or any other of MEDIGO's agents.



  1. ##### 4. No Liability for Services of Third Persons

  2.     1. 4.1.

MEDIGO accepts no liability for the correctness, completion and up-to-dateness of any information provided by Providers or any other third parties on MEDIGO's website. As a service Provider, MEDIGO is, according to sec. 7 paragraph 1 of the German Telemedia Act ( _TMG_ ), only responsible for its own content that is held for use on MEDIGO's website. However, in accordance with sec. 7 paragraph 2 TMG, as a service provider in terms of sec. 8 through 10 TMG, MEDIGO is not obligated to monitor transferred or stored external information or check said information for circumstances that point to unlawful activity. Irrespective of this non-responsibility under the TMG, MEDIGO's obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with other legal provisions shall remain unaffected.

    2. 4.2.

MEDIGO's website contains cross references (so-called links) to websites belonging to third parties (e.g. Providers, hospitals, travel agencies or certification bodies) over the content of which MEDIGO has no influence. The relevant owner or operator of the websites alone is responsible for the content of linked sites. MEDIGO does not assume any liability for this external content. The linked sites were superficially checked for possible violations of the law when they were first linked to; there was no obvious violation of the law of the content discernible at that time. However, MEDIGO does not constantly check the external content for changes which could form a new basis for a liability. However, MEDIGO will remove a link to a third-party-website if it becomes apparent that the content of the linked website is unlawful and might result in any liability of MEDIGO. 



  1. ##### 5. User's Liability

  2.     1. 5.1.

The user is obliged to indemnify and compensate MEDIGO for any damages due to User's culpable violation of the applicable law or the Terms in connection with the use of Services.

This applies to the following Specific Services: 

    1. 4.1.

We provide a platform enabling the User to get in contact with further service providers (e.g. travel agencies or hotels) whose services might be useful in connection with a medical treatment.

As far as required and permitted by law, we will share personal data with companies, organisations or individuals outside MEDIGO if we believe that the passing on is reasonably necessary to enforce applicable terms of service (including investigation of potential violations), address security or technical issues or protect against harm to the rights of MEDIGO.

  6. 6.

You have the right at any time to oppose the collecting, processing and use of personal data and specific personal data with effect for the future.
