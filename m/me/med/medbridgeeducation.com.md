**_III. Automatically Collected Information_**

**A. Information Collected Via Technology**  
As you use MedBridge, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on MedBridge you clicked. This type of information is collected to make MedBridge and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the experience with LivingSocial to meet your special interests and needs.  
We engage in remarketing to market our sites across the web. When a user visits our site, a cookie is dropped on the user. Users with this cookie may be targeted across advertising networks to receive relevant advertisements. You may opt out of this ad serving using the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out page (http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. For example, we, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access MedBridge to assist with ad targeting.  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with MedBridge. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. 

We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on MedBridge. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies and/or "Web Beacons" (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.

**_IV. Safety Measures_**

**A. Internet Security**

We use a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or access your personal information: (i) A secure server. (ii) All sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then entered into our Payment gateway providers database accessible only to  those authorized who are required to keep the information confidential. (iii) All data stored on the MedBridge Site server(s) is stored in a database “behind” a secure firewall. (iv) There is no permissible access to the database outside of the hosted environment. (v) After a transaction, your private information (credit card information) will not be stored on our servers.

**B. Security Limitations Disclaimer**  
MedBridge cannot and does not guarantee that Personal Information you post on the MedBridge Site will not be accessed by unauthorized persons. Despite MedBridge’s efforts to safeguard your  personal information, there is always a risk of security breach. MedBridge is not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures of the MedBridge Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of Personal Information on User Profiles may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your Personal Information.
