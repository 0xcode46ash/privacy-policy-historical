# Medical Connections Inc. - Privacy Statement

Medical Connections is committed to protecting your privacy. You can visit most pages on our site without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request. This privacy statement explains data collection and use in those situations. This privacy statement only applies to Medicalconnections.com; it does not apply to other online or offline Medical Connections sites. 

### Collection of your Personal Information

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are registering before entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, signing up for an event or training, or when purchasing and/or registering for a Medical Connections produce to service. Personal information collected by Medicalconnections.com often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested. 

### Use of your Personal Information

We use your personal information for the following purposes: 

  * To ensure our site is relevant to your needs. 
  * To deliver services, such as newsletters, events, training or software that you request. 
  * To help us create and publish content most relevant to you. 
  * To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from Medical Connections, if you so request. 
  * To allow you access to limited-entry areas of our site as appropriate. 



We will merge site-visitation data with anonymous demographic information for research purposes, and we may use this information in aggregate to provide more relevant content. In some limited-entry sections of Medicalconnections.com, with your approval, we will combine site-visitation data with your personal information in order to provide you with personalized content. If you decline permission, we will not provide you the personalized service and won't merge your personal information with site-visitation data. 

Medical Connections may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Medical Connections or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Medical Connections, or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Medical Connections employees, users of Medical Connections products or services, or members of the public. 

### Control of your Personal Information

When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, Medicalconnections.com will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above. 

### Security of your Personal Information

Medicalconnections.com is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide in computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit sensitive information (such as a credit card number) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. 

### Use of Cookies

When someone visits the site, a cookie is placed on the customer's machine (if the customer accepts cookies) or is read if the customer has visited the site previously. One use of cookies is to assist in the collection of the site visitation statistics described above. 

We also use cookies to collect information on which newsletter links are clicked by customers. This information is used to ensure we are sending information customers want to read. It is collected in aggregate form and never linked with your personal information.
