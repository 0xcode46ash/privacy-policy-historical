# MedCalc Software's privacy policy

At MedCalc Software we recognize that privacy is important. This document outlines the types of information we receive and collect when you visit our websites.

## Personal information and other data

  * When you purchase a software license, we collect personal information such as your name, postal address and email address. This information is stored to provide services such as automatic retrieval of your sofware product keys. 
  * When you visit our website, our web servers automatically record information such as the URL, browser type and language, and the date and time of your visit.

MedCalc Software never shares this information with third parties.

All data are stored on our servers located in different countries in the European Community. All communication to and from these servers is encrypted (TLS, Transport Layer Security).

**How long do we keep personal data?**

  * We save your data up to 2 years after your license expires or is terminated. 



**Can I review and correct my personal data you have on file?**

  * Yes, you can. Please visit [Review personal data](https://www.medcalc.org/reviewpersonaldata.php) for more information.
