## General security advice

Before submitting any personal details online, such as a password, you should make sure your computer has the latest operating system security updates installed. This will help protect your computer against online security threats.

You should be aware of the following issues.

### Malicious code

Malicious code can exist in the form of a virus, trojan, worm or other variant. There are a number of steps you can take to reduce the chances of your computer being infected by malicious code. Anti-virus software lets you detect, and in some cases remove, malicious files from your computer. However, there will always be a risk that your computer may become infected as there is a delay between the release of a new virus or trojan and the time it takes the anti-virus vendors to update their software.

If you suspect your computer has been infected by a virus, trojan or other malicious program, you should contact your IT service provider or anti-virus vendor.

### Anti-virus software

You should make sure your anti-virus software is up-to-date by installing the latest available patches or signatures. Patches are generally provided to close security holes that may be exploited by malicious attackers. While these are often available from your anti-virus vendor, you may need to subscribe to receive these updates. Patches may be applied manually or automatically and this is dependent on the type of anti-virus software you use. Ideally you should configure your software to automatically install any new updates as soon as they become available.

### Configure your anti-virus software

You should configure your anti-virus software to scan all inbound and outbound emails to make sure you do not send or receive any malicious content. It is also important to configure your software to scan any files you download from the internet. Contact your anti-virus vendor for specific information on configuration settings.

### Spyware

Spyware is software that gathers information such as internet browsing habits or personal information from email and internet chat services. The information is usually used for advertising purposes. Most internet browsers can be configured to reduce the likelihood of your privacy being invaded by spyware or other malicious programs. For more information contact your IT service provider.

### Update your software and operating system

You should update your other programs and operating systems with patches or updates provided by software vendors. You should regularly check vendor websites for notification of any new patches or service packs applicable to the software on your computer.

### Be suspicious of strange email attachments or hyperlinks

You should be cautious of the email attachments you receive as they may contain malicious content. Configuring your anti-virus software to scan your email is important, but your computer may still be vulnerable to new viruses or trojans hidden in attachments. If you are suspicious of the content of an email attachment, simply delete it. Alternatively, you may want to call the company to confirm the email's authenticity.

'Phishing' scams attempt to deceive you into divulging information that should not be disclosed. The most common phishing scams are unsolicited email made to look like they have originated from a legitimate company or financial institution. You may be encouraged to click on a hyperlink in the email to enter your personal or financial information into a website. While a website may seem legitimate, it may have been created by the scammer for the purpose of gaining your personal information such as passwords and credit card details. Your information could also be used for identity theft for the scammer's financial gain.
