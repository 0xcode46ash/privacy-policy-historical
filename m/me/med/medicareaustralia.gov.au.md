# Clearing house privacy | Australian Taxation Office

  * The information you provide to the Small Business Superannuation Clearing House (the clearing house) will be used for the purpose of administering the clearing house program.

The ATO is a government agency bound by the Privacy Act 1988 in terms of collection and handling of personal information and tax file numbers (TFNs). For further information about privacy law notices please go to ato.gov.au/privacy.

The collection of this information is authorised by the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_.

This information may be disclosed to the relevant super funds and financial institutions in relation to payments under the clearing house program, and relevant government agencies, or as authorised or required by law.

To ensure that your business's employees are made aware of how we intend to use and disclose the information collected by the clearing house, we ask that you print and provide your business's employees with the following Employee privacy note.

**Employee privacy note**

> The information you have provided to your employer will be used by the Small Business Superannuation Clearing House program to facilitate superannuation payments to you.

> The collection of this information is authorised by the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_.

> While it is not compulsory for you to provide your tax file number (TFN) to your super fund, if you choose not to:

    * your super fund may have to pay extra income tax on contributions your employer makes for you (including salary sacrifice) and may take this extra money out of your super account
    * your super fund may not be able to accept some contributions
    * you may miss out on super co-contributions even if otherwise eligible.
