# MedPage Today: Breaking Medical News + CME

  
MedPage Today is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of visitors to our Web site. MedPage Today requires that you provide us with personally identifiable information in order to have ongoing access to our Web site and to participate in the continuing medical education activities that we provide.

By accessing our Web site, you expressly consent and agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy, including our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, then please do not use or access our Web site.

**About this Privacy Policy**  
www.medpagetoday.com is our Web site for physicians and allied health care professionals, although it is available to non health care professionals as well.

MedPage Today is the name we use to refer to our entire company, even though our formal corporate name is MedPage Today, LLC. When we refer to ourselves as "we" or "MedPage Today," we mean our company, MedPage Today, LLC., including any subsidiary that we control. We may share information among our subsidiaries that we own or control, but it is always protected under the terms of this privacy policy.

This privacy policy applies only to the MedPage Today Web site. You should read the privacy policy at each Web site that you visit after you leave our site. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of other Web sites, including without limitation, sites that link to or from our site, once you leave www.medpagetoday.com.

**Privacy Policy Changes**  
If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page. Users should check this policy to keep abreast of any changes. Your access or use of our Web site after the posting of such changes shall constitute acceptance of any such changes.

**Information We Collect from Unregistered Visitors**  
Visitors to our Web site can access the Web site's home page and browse the site without disclosing any personally identifiable information. We do track information provided to us by your browser, including the Web site you came from (known as the "referring URL"), the type of browser you use, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you.

**Information We Collect When You Register**  
Visitors registering on our Web site are asked to provide us with personally identifying information, such as name, contact information, and other identifying information. On our registration screens, we label which information is required for registration, and which information is optional and may be given at your discretion.

**Changing Your Information**  
You may review and change your personally identifiable information by logging onto our Web site and entering in the new information. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.

Upon your written request, we will deactivate your account and remove your personally identifiable information from our active database, but we can maintain your personally identifiable information in our records to be used for purposes such as verification of CME or CE credits (for CME or CE program participants), fraud protection and to resolve disputes.

**Use of Cookies**  
Cookies are a technology used by the MedPage Today Web site to identify a user as the user moves through the Web site. Your browser allows us to place some information on your computer's hard drive that identifies the computer you are using. We use cookies to track your usage throughout our Web site.

Your Web browser can be set to allow you to control whether you will accept cookies, reject cookies, or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to you. If your browser is set to reject cookies, Web sites that are cookie-enabled will not recognize you when you return to the Web site, and some Web site functionality may be lost. The Help section of your browser will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies.

Although cookies do not normally contain personally identifiable information, if you are a registered user we may associate your registration information with cookies our Web site places on your computer's hard drive. Associating a cookie with your registration data allows us to offer increased personalization and functionality. For example, you can elect to have our Web site "remember" you. Without cookies, this functionality would not be possible.

We may use your personal information to provide to you advertisements, promotions and information relevant to your use of the Web site. If you do not want to receive email communications, you should update your profile.

**We do not control the use of cookies by third parties with respect to certain pages of our Web site that are placed by third parties.**

MedPage Today uses technology provided by a third-party to serve ads when you visit this Web site. This technology may use information about your visit to this Web site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. We customize the advertisements that you see based upon: (i) the information that you knowingly provide; (ii) geographic location which we determine through your IP address; (iii) data we receive from third parties and (iv) your behavior on this Web site or other sites. In the course of serving advertisements to this Web site, such third-party advertising technology may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used to target ads to you, please visit <http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/opting_out.aspx>. In addition, you have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser.

MedPage Today may also use a third party ad network provider, Collective, to help present advertisements on this Web site. Third party network advertisers, along with other advertisers and sponsors on the Web site, may use cookies, web beacons (also called single pixel gifs or action tags) or similar technologies (and, in the case of cookies, access them on your computer if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser), (i) to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, (ii) to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, (iii) to avoid sending you duplicated advertisements and (iv) to understand the usage patterns of people who see advertisements. In doing so, the provider collects non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed and other clickstream data. Ad networks may connect information about your visit on our Web site with information about your visit on other sites and show you advertising based on this combined information. The advertisement may appear when you are visiting a different section of this Web site or any other sites on the Internet if such other sites also have a relationship with our ad network provider.

The use of third party cookies, web beacons and similar technologies by these ad network providers is governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. Please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp> to learn more about the information collection practices and if you wish to "opt-out" of participating in advertising programs conducted by Collective and third party ad network providers.

**Children's Privacy**  
MedPage Today's Web site is designed and intended for use by adults, and is not intended for, nor designed to be used by children under the age of 18. Persons under the age of 18 should not submit any personal information to us.

**Uses We Make of Information**  
In this section of our privacy policy, we identify the ways we may use information about you that we have collected.

**Aggregate Data**  
We create aggregate data about visitors to our Web site for activity development and improvement. We also use it for market analysis. We may provide information from our Web site in aggregate form, with no identifying information, to third parties. For example, we may tell a third party what percentage of our registered users reside in a particular geographical area. When aggregated information is provided, we pool it from many individual records and strip it of any data that could be used to identify an individual before it is used. Any third party that receives aggregated data must agree not to attempt to re-identify the people it belongs to. MedPage Today will not sell any user data to any third party for commercial purposes, without permission from the user. 

**CME Participants**  
Participants in the CME program on this Web site must agree to permit their personally identifying information to be disclosed to our CME accredited sponsor, the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Office of Continuing Medical Education to ensure that participants receive proper CME credit. **If you do not wish your personally identifying information so disclosed, then you must not participate in the CME Program, and by choosing to participate in the CME program you are thereby agreeing to the disclosure of your personally identifying information for the purposes outlined herein and on the CME page of this Web site.**

**Third Parties**  
In addition to aggregate information (discussed previously), we may share some information with third parties as described below. If we transfer a business unit (such as a subsidiary) or an asset (such as a Web site) to another company, we will require them to honor the applicable terms of this privacy policy.

**Protection of Information**  
In this section of our privacy policy, we discuss the security measures we take to protect information that we have collected about you. 

**General Policies**  
We have implemented technology and security policies, rules and other measures to protect the personal data that we have under our control from unauthorized access, improper use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction, and accidental loss. We also protect your information by requiring that all our employees and others who have access to or are associated with the processing of your data respect your confidentiality. In addition, we have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss or misuse of information at our site that we have collected from you. 

**MedPage Today Employees**  
MedPage Today employees are required to keep user information confidential, as a condition of their employment with the company. Only selected, authorized MedPage Today employees are permitted to access your registration information.  
Employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement. All employees and contractors must abide by our privacy policy, and those who violate that policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of their employment or contract and legal action.

**Law Enforcement**  
We also provide your personally identifiable information in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity. We also can release your personally identifiable information in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity.
