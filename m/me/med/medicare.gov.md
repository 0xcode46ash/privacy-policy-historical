The privacy of our customers is important to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). We understand that visitors to _**hcfa.gov**_ and _**medicare.gov**_ need to be in control of their personal information. Therefore, the following is HCFA's Internet Privacy Policy:

  * You do not have to give us personal information to visit our sites. If you choose not to provide personal information, you can still visit _**hcfa.gov**_ and _**medicare.gov**_ pages. 
  * We may collect personally identifiable information (name, e-mail address, physical address, and other unique identifier) only if specifically and knowingly provided by you. 
  * Personally identifying information collected will be used only in connection with _**hcfa.gov**_ , _**medicare.gov**_ , or for such purposes as are described at the point of collection. 
  * Information collected is for statistical purposes only. HCFA performs analyses of user behavior in order to measure customer interest in the various areas of our sites. HCFA also uses listserves to send out information and change notices to subscribed users of our sites. 
  * HCFA will protect the personal information that you share with us. HCFA does not disclose, give, sell, or transfer any personal information to third parties. If we share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only. 
  * While HCFA will make every attempt to protect the personal information that you share with us, electronic mail is not secure against interception. If your communication is very sensitive, you may want to send it by postal mail instead. 
  * HCFA would like to receive your comments and questions about this Internet Privacy Policy. Visit our [Customer Service Page](https://web.archive.org/custserv/customer.htm) to address your comments or questions regarding HCFA's Internet Privacy Policy. 
  * HCFA may occasionally update this policy. Notice of revisions will be posted here. 



**We want to be very clear: We will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless _you_ choose to provide such information.**
