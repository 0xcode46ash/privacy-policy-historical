## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") covers the websites at www.medialets.com (the "Sites"), owned and operated by Medialets, Inc. (the "Company", "we", "us", "our") and any products and/or services provided on or through the Sites.

Your privacy is important to us. You can trust that we will share information about you in both carefully and responsibly. 

This Policy describes our practices with respect to you or your company’s personally identifiable information ("You"). In particular, it defines: 1) what personal information we collect, 2) how we collect personal information, 3) how we use personal information, 4) how we protect personal information, 5) who, if anyone, we share personal information with, and 6) how you can access or correct personal information.

By visiting the Sites and/or using any products or services provided on or through the Sites, you agree to the terms of this Policy in full and without modification. If you do not agree to the terms of the Policy, you do not have the right to access the Sites or to use any of the products and/or services provided on or through the Sites. If you visit the Sites, your visit and any possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Policy and any applicable Terms of Service, including limitations on damages and the application of New York State law.

### What Personal Information is Collected

We collect and store personal information you choose to enter on the Sites, or provide to us by telephone or by electronic mail, or in any other way. For example, when you register for our products or services, we collect personal information about your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, user name, password and social security number or tax identification number. We may combine this information with other information about you that we receive from other sources, both on and offline, to improve the quality of our products and services and enhance your experience.

Certain products or services offered by Medialets may require that we collect the phone number and/or other unique identifiers of your users for their device. Some mobile phone service providers are required to record the physical location of all devices that use their service. It is possible that Medialets will receive this information, depending on the mobile phone service provider policies.

### How Personal Information is Collected

To serve you better, we use "cookie" technology. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers, usually stored on a user’s computer hard drive, which enable us to "personalize" the Sites for each user. They also tell us how and when pages in our Sites are visited and by how many people. We generally use cookies to help with customer tracking and to reduce the time it takes for pages to load into your browser. Our cookies do not collect personal information.

When you visit our Sites, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends, including things like your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language and the date and time of your request. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how well the Sites are working so we can continue to improve our product and services to benefit our customers.

When users of your applications connect to Medialets services on their mobile devices, we may receive the unique identification of their device or their phone number if provided by their mobile phone service carrier. 

When you contact us via contact forms on the Sites, send e-mails or other communications to Medialets, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.

### How Personal Information is Used

We use the information we collect from you and your users to:

  * Provide our products and services to users, including the display of customized content, identification, contact information and authentication;
  * Ensure the technical functioning of our products, services and network;
  * Improve upon our products and services;
  * Better understand the products and services that are of interest to our users.



We may use personally identifiable information in an aggregate form to gain a broader perspective of what preferences our users have, and to measure interest in the various areas of the Site. In some cases e-mail addresses or phone numbers may be used to contact users regarding service updates, confirmations, opt-in surveys and select partner offers. You may opt-out of receiving marketing messages regarding partner offers.

If users of your applications connect to Medialets services on their mobile devices, Medialets may use the unique mobile device identification or phone numbers provided by carriers to offer users extended services and/or functionality. In some circumstances, Medialets may associate phone numbers or unique identifiers to other information we have collected from and about these users. Medialets will not use phones or unique identifiers for purposes of telemarketing.

### How Personal Information is Protected

Medialets takes all reasonable measures to protect the security of your personal information during transmission, including the use of Sockets Layer (SSL) software that encrypts the information you input. We also take reasonable measures to safeguard personal information and to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of such information through our data collection, storage and security practices. You should take further precautions to protect personal data by safeguarding your user name and password and by limiting the use of shared computers.

All personal information is stored on our secure servers in the United States of America.

### How Personal Information is Shared

Medialets does not share your personal information except as provided in this Policy or approved by you. Medialets restricts access to personal information to employees, contractors and agents who need to know the information in order to operate, develop or improve our services and to service our customers. Wetake all reasonable steps to ensure that these parties comply with confidentiality obligations. They may not use such information for any purpose other than providing such services to Company.

Medialets may share personal information if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

  * Comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request,
  * detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues,
  * enforce or investigate violations of applicable Terms of Service,
  * protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Medialets, its employees, its users or the public, as required or permitted by law, or,
  * allow service providers, vendors, contractors and other agents to fulfill their obligations on behalf of Medialets.



Medialets may sell all or certain of our assets or business or Sites. In the event there is an acquisition or sale of some or all of the assets of Medialets, or any product or service thereof, personal information may be shared with relevant buyers or proposed buyers. Medialets will work in good faith to ensure these privacy rights or similar will be conveyed through any such purchase.

Medialets may share aggregate personal information about you with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.
