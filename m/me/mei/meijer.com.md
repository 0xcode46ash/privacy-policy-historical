# Meijer: Privacy & Security

### Plain Talk About Internet Privacy

We collect personal information on this web site. The following privacy policy applies to Meijer’s web site ([www.meijer.com](http://www.meijer.com/), the “Site”), but it does not apply to the web sites linked to the Site operated by our retail partners: the online photo center (LifePics), school uniforms (French Toast), and specialty foods (Kehe Food Distributors). This privacy policy also does not apply to our partners providing Meijer credit cards and charge cards (GE Money Bank), college savings (Upromise), the Meijer Extended Protection available for certain customer purchases (N.E.W.), and text messaging services (MeijerConnect). These web sites are not owned or operated by us and not under our control. They have their own privacy policies. You may want to review the privacy policies of these sites and how they collect and use personal information.

Please note that the Pharmacy portion of our Site is subject to [different privacy regulations](https://web.archive.org/content/content_leftnav_manual.jsp?pageName=pharmacy_privacy_notice) required by the federal government.   


**Online Privacy and Security  
**Meijer makes every effort to create an online environment that is safe, easy, and respects your privacy. Except as required by law, we won't sell, rent or give information which identifies you personally to anyone if you've directed us not to in the manner described below. Personal information is information about you that is not publicly available and can identify you, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number. 

We do not partner or have a special relationship with any ad server company.   


**What Personal Information Do We Collect?**

  * When you visit the Site, our web server automatically recognizes your domain name, your computer's operating system, browser type, the address of the web page you're coming from and of those pages you visit on our Site. We use this data in the aggregate to determine how much our customers use parts of our Site so we can improve it. We may also match user information with offline data available from other sources in order to carry out our services and conduct target advertising and promotions more effectively. But we don't automatically recognize or collect your name, email address, home address or telephone number. 
  * We do collect personal information consisting of the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, the email addresses of those who make postings to our chat areas, and information that customers volunteer, such as survey information and the information provided to enter an on-line sweepstakes. 
  * When you order goods available for purchase on our Site, we collect additional personal information consisting of your name, address, phone number, credit card or other payment information, and “ship-to” name and address, if different than your name and address. 
  * We collect billing and shipping information for purchases of Meijer Gift Cards made with a debit or credit card. This may include your name, billing address, the card type, number and expiration date. We also collect information that allows us to ship your order, including the name, address, and telephone number of the intended recipient. All purchases of Meijer Gift Cards are also subject to the [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/content/content.jsp?pageName=giftcard_terms) **.** ****
  * We use “cookies” to store and sometimes track information about you when you visit the Site. A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to remind us who you are and enable us to access your information (including what is in your shopping cart) so you do not have to re-enter it; gather statistical information about usage by registered or unregistered users; research visiting patterns; help target advertisements based on user interests; assist our retail partners in the tracking of visits and the processing of orders; and track the progress and participation in promotions. In some instances, our retail partners and advertisers appearing on our Site may use their own cookies. Preference and options configurations in your browser determine if and how a cookie will be accepted. You can change those configurations on your computer if you desire. By changing your preferences, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a cookie is set, or you can reject all cookies. If you do so and cookies are disabled, you may be required to re-enter your information more often and certain features on our Site may be unavailable. 



**How Do We Use Your Personal Information?**

  * All personal information that we collect is used to improve our Site, used to customize the content or layout of our Site pages for individual visitors, used to notify customers about updates to the Site, shared with other reputable organizations to help them contact customers for marketing purposes, used by us to contact customers for marketing purposes and used to communicate with our customers about their orders or accounts (transactional and administrative messages). 
  * We may also share your personal information with our strategic partners and other third parties that perform services or functions on our behalf, but their activities are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations. We may also share aggregated data with these parties. Aggregated data is gathered from many different customers and does not contain any personal information. 
  * From time to time, we may use your personal information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice.  If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes to our Site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.  If you are concerned about how your personal information is used, you should check back at the Site periodically.   




**What About the Privacy Rights of Children?**

  * Just like you, we're especially aware of children's privacy issues. We know that parents are justifiably concerned about their children's activities online and what's being done with the information they reveal. That's why we will never intentionally collect information from children under 13, with the exception of email addresses used only for reply purposes.
