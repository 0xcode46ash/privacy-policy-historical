Information We Collect

None. We're not Big Brother. The only stuff we keep is if you subscribe to the magazine, send us an email or sign up for our email newsletter. And then, we keep it in a very safe place and don't let anyone else see it, not even our mothers.

We love cookies, particularly chocolate chip. We don't, however, use Web cookies on our site. At least not yet.

Policy Modifications

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time on a whim, for our own amusement. We have to have fun somehow.
