# MenuPalace.com Corporation Privacy Statement

MenuPalace.com ("MenuPalace") is committed to upholding fundamental principles of honesty and integrity in our relationship with visitors to our web site. Our objective is to build an enduring relationship between MenuPalace and our users based on a foundation of integrity and trust. 

To that end, MenuPalace has adopted rigorous standards of privacy and makes the following promise to every visitor to our web site: 

**1.** When a visitor to MenuPalace is required to submit registration information as a prerequisite for accessing any content area of MenuPalace or to use any of its interactive services, contests or newsgroups, or e-commerce applications, MenuPalace will not share or sell that personal information about our users to any outside agency, advertiser or other third party unless the user was made aware of this possibility prior to submitting their personal information. 

**2.** Although MenuPalace will use "cookies" to track user patterns on its web site, MenuPalace will not use cookies to learn the identity of its users, nor attempt to track users after they leave the MenuPalace site. Further, cookies will not be used by MenuPalace to gather specific personal information about individual users. The usage patterns tracked by individual cookies will remain confidential, and MenuPalace will not participate in any external site tracking programs. Nor will we share any cookie-generated information about individual users or user patterns with outside agencies or advertisers. A MenuPalace advertiser may be given summaries of collective user patterns. For example, an advertiser might be told their ad was viewed by 10,000 users on a particular day and 100 clicked on the ad. But an advertiser will never be given information about individual users or their browsing habits. 

**3.** MenuPalace will not send unsolicited email to its users without their consent. Nor will the use of cookies by MenuPalace result in a MenuPalace user receiving unsolicited email from MenuPalace or its advertisers, without their consent. MenuPalace will not supply email addresses to any third party without having obtained the consent of a user. 

**4.** When MenuPalace asks its users to supply optional, personal information for contests, survey, e-commerce applications, or for any other purpose, that information will remain private and not be shared with any outside agency, advertiser or third party unless the user was made aware of this possibility prior to submitting their personal information. 

**5.** MenuPalace will compile site-wide demographic information that it will share with advertisers, but it will not compile profiles of individual users, including the gathering of names, addresses, email addresses and other personal information, to be shared with an advertiser unless the user has consented to the compilation of this material and submitted it freely in a registration form or survey. 

**6.** MenuPalace tracks user IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, demographic profiling and traffic logging, but MenuPalace will not use IP addresses to try to identify individual users of MenuPalace. 

**7.** MenuPalace will abide by all court orders, valid search warrants and subpoenas.
