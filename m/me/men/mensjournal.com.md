**Your California Privacy Rights (As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)**

A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.

However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its Privacy Policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure or gives customers a mechanism to opt out of having their personal information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise the right.

We have opted for this alternative approach.  As stated in our Privacy Policy, we give customers a mechanism to opt out of having their personal information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of third parties that received your personal information for marketing purposes.

If you wish to opt-out of sharing your Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please click [here](mailto:letters@mensjournal.com?subject=re:Opt-Out) and mark your request “Re: Opt-out.”

California customers may request further information about our approach to this law by writing to us at the address provided in the “Contact Us” section above or by email by clicking [here](mailto:letters@mensjournal.com) and requesting further information.
