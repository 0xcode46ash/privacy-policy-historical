We respect the privacy of the information you provide to us. This summary of our online information practices demonstrates our commitment to protect your privacy. We do not sell, rent, share or in any other way use personally-identifying information collected during your use of our Website without your permission. 

At the time you register on our site, we collect and store your name, address, email address, and other personally-identifying information. We need this information to contact you to discuss terms of sale. We may also ask you for personally-identifying information at other times, such as if you communicate with us, or complete a survey. 

As part of our service, we may use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to remind us who you are and enable us to access your account information so you do not have to re-enter it; gather statistical information about usage by registered or unregistered users, research visiting patterns, and help target marketing efforts based on user interests. Preference and options configurations in your browser determine if and how a cookie will be accepted. You can change those configurations on your computer if you desire. By changing your preferences, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a cookie is set, or you can reject all cookies. If you do so and cookies are disabled, you may be required to re-enter your information more often and certain features of our site may be unavailable. 

In addition, we automatically gather general statistical information about our Website and visitors, such as IP addresses, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors, goods and services purchased, etc., but in doing so we do not reference you by individual name, e-mail address, home address, or telephone number. We use this data in the aggregate to determine how much our customers use parts of our site so we can improve our site. We may provide this statistical information to third parties, but when we do so we do not provide personally-identifying information without your permission. 

We use your personally-identifying information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's content, layout, and services. We use your e-mail address, your mailing address, and phone number to contact you regarding administrative notices, new product offerings and communications relevant to your use of the site. If you place a request for products or services, we use information to further process your request. We may also use or disclose information to resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our User Agreement. At times, we may review status or activity of multiple users to do so. We may disclose or access information whenever we believe in good faith that the law so requires or if we otherwise consider it necessary to do so to maintain service and improve our products and services.   
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to manage our Website and to enhance our site based on the usage pattern data we receive. 

**Security**  
We employ reasonable and current security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information. Your account information and profile are password-protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Our personnel will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your session. This is to help ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place where others may have access to it   
Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others.   
No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure. As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 

**Your consent**  
By using our Website, you consent to the collection and use of this information in the manner we describe.
