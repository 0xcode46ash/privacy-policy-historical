## Choices for personal information

When you sign up for mention, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. 

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features or Services may not function properly if cookies are disabled. 

You can decline to submit personal information to any of our Services, in which case mention may not be able to provide those Services to you. 

## Information sharing

mention only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of mention in the following limited circumstances: 

  * We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for sharing any sensitive personal information.
  * We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
  * We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of mention, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.



If mention becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular hyperlink. Such information does not identify you individually. 

## Information security

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. 

We restrict access to personal information to mention employees, contractors and agents who need to know this information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are also bound by confidentiality obligations. 

## Data integrity

We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. 

We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. 

## Accessing and updating personal information

When you use mention services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at any time, if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. 

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
