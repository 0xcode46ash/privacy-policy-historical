# Mental Help Net - About - Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**  
 **by Mark Dombeck, Ph.D.**

Last updated on July 22th, 2002 

**Information Gathered:**

Mental Help Net gathers information from the people who use our site so that we can offer our users a better, more fulfilling experience. We gather this information in a manner that provides for protection of personal privacy, and with an eye towards maintaining the security of all gathered information. This document details how we go about collecting, maintaining and storing your information. 

**General Information Gathering**

  * Web Server Logs  
Like most sites, we keep a running record of what pages are requested on our site. Our web server logs contain information about what pages are most popular, and how many pages are viewed in a given time period. 
  * Search Engines  
We do not track search engine usage. No records are kept of any searches you might perform on Mental Help Net. 
  * Community Database  
We use Webboard software (O'reilly and Associates) for our community. This software mandates users create accounts which are stored in a database. Users need not supply any identifying information upon creating accounts, although they are free to do so if they wish. See notes below concerning the Professional Community for additional data gathering. 



**Specific Site Resources Where Information Is Collected**

  * Community Registration  
Collection Point: on the Community Registration page  
Registration Information is maintained: On Site  

    * We require that you complete a registration process before you can gain entry into our forums and chats (our community area). We require that you give us your name and a valid email address where you may be reached. You may provide additional optional information if you wish. 
    * We maintain a professional community that is closed to lay users. We ask that potential users of this system submit information concerning their professional backgrounds to aid Mental Help Net staff in determining eligibility for this professional resource. 
  * Email Newsletter  
Collection Point: on home page at the bottom of the screen or at the NewsLetter Signup page  
Registration Information is maintained: On Site  

    * Persons desiring to receive our Monthly Newsletter must first provide us with their Email address. Registration for the Newsletter is completely optional 
  * Yellowpages Registration  
Collection Point: on the Yellowpages Signup page  
Registration Information is maintained: On Site  

    * Clinicians who wish to sign up for our free clinician listings must register by completing a form listing information about their practice. Placing information into the Yellowpages database is completely optional 
  * JobLink Database  
Collection Point: on the JobLink Signup page  
Registration Information is maintained: On Site  

    * Users may submit job listings and resumes to our site. This service is completely optional. 



**Use Of Cookies On Mental Help Net**

  * Session Cookies  
All CenterSite websites (Mental Help Net included) save a session identifier (a long random string of letters and numbers) as a cookie on site users' computers. This session identifer uniquely identifies the user for the duration of each session and then expires. No identifying information can be tied to this identifier once the session has ended (sessions expire after approximatly 20 minutes of inactivity, or when a client closes his or her browser completely). 
  * Automatic Logon to the Community Areas  
Frequent visitors to our community area may optionally have our server 'remember' their user name and password by saving references to this information on to the users' computer in a "cookie" file (a text file that allows web sites to store and read information on your computer relevant to your web accounts). Mental Help Net does not place any personally identifying information into this cookie file. Your Mental Help Net User ID automatically identifies your computer -- but not you -- to our servers when you visit our site. Unless you specifically tell us, Mental Help Net will never know who you are, even though we assign your computer a cookie. Cookie use is completely optional. 
  * Third Party Cookies Embedded In Ad Banners  
Advertising on helps us to bring our services to you at absolutely no cost. The price of this free service is that companies placing ad banners on our site have the ability to assign your computer a cookie that uniquely identifies your computer. The ad cookies identify your computer and not your personal identity. The banner cookies are used by the ad companies to keep track of which ad banners you click on. The ad companies are interested in building up a profile of what you purchase so that they can send you ads that you are likely to be interested in when you visit in the future. Mental Help Net does not share any information with the ad companies that would allow them to link your personal identity to the cookie ID number they may have assigned you. 



**Use Of The Information**

Mental Help Net uses the information we gather from you for several purposes: 

  * We analyze what our customers like and don't like about our current offerings so that we can design better services. 
  * Mental Help Net does not engage in profiling (e.g., matching your computer with your interests). 
  * We develop summary -- not individual -- reports for our advertisers. An example of a summary report might be "200 people clicked on your advertisement "X" today." Advertisers use this information to track the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. We never tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements. 
  * The community registration information is used in several ways. First, registration serves as a means of allowing you to be uniquely identified, so that users can keep track of who said what. Second, you may optionally have our forum software place your email address into messages you send so that people can mail you personally in response. Third, we use the registration information to identify and communicate with persons who post inappropriate messages in the forums and chats. The registration also serves as a means of blocking known abusive users from entering the community. Fourth, we use information gathered by prospective applicants to our professional community to determine eligibility (to aid in our discrimination between lay persons and professional clinicians). 
  * Subscribers to our newsletter receive monthly email newsletters including information about new products and services from Mental Help Net. 
  * Mental Help Net clinicians can post listings describing their services to our databases. This information is made available to the public for searching. 



**Information Removal**

  * We regularly remove outdated postings from our discussion forums. We will also remove any posting to our discussion forums or mailing list archives from any individual author if they let us know (contact the Webmaster). 
  * We regularly remove community user accounts from our computer systems when their accounts have become inactive (no usage for longer than 6 months) or their e-mail address expires. 



**User Control Over The Information**

In most cases, you have the ability to view and modify your information: 

  * Community Registration  
You may view, modify, and/or control the use of most of your registration information. For instance, you can tell us if you don't want to be listed in service directories, such as user listings in our chat rooms. Access the form for controlling your forum experience by selecting "options" from the navigation bar at the top of the screen while you are viewing a message in the forums. You will need to be logged into the forums in order to access this feature. Click on "Profile" in our chat rooms to update your user information there. If you would like your account completely deleted, please drop us a note and we'll take care of it for you. 
  * Newsletter  
You can tell us if you don't want to receive communication from Mental Help Net such as our e-mail newsletter. You can remove yourself from the newsletter distribution list at any time by either following the directions included at the bottom of the newsletter, or by going to the bottom of our homepage, entering your email and pressing the remove button. 
  * Yellowpages  
You may edit your account provided you can supply the system with the username and password you were assigned when you created your listing. (Lost your password? Contact the Webmaster). 
  * JobLink  
Contact the Webmaster directly concerning deletion of materials from the JobLink Databases. 



**Special Security Considerations**

Mental Help Net employs uniform security measures (which are not here disclosed in order to protect the safety of your information) across all information collection points. In general, we do not ask you for highly sensitive information (e.g., medical status, etc.), so there is little need for a special class of high security information collection procedures. Where credit card information is taken (e.g., in the job listings portion of the website), that information is in our custody for the duration of the time it takes to process your transaction. Credit card information is _never saved_ on any Centersite computer 

**Distribution Of The Information**

Mental Help Net will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its users to any third party without first receiving that individual's permission. 

  * The individually identifiable information that you provide will be used for Mental Help Net purposes only. 
  * Mental Help Net does not share information with third parties except as identified below in "Appendix A: Third Party Partners" 
  * Where sharing does occur it is in the interest of making your experience of Mental Help Net a more pleasant and cohesive one. We do not form alliances with companies who will misuse or compromise the security of your information. 
  * Other companies which place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising or content. Mental Help Net does not control this ad-related collection of information. You should contact these advertisers or content providers directly if you have any questions about their use of this information. 



**Privacy Policy Appendices**

**Appendix A: Third Party Partners**

Mental Help Net has formed relationships with the following third party companies in order to bring you a more compelling web experience. We share some degree of information with these services (full details below). 

We do not and will not do business with Third Party Partners who do not guarantee the safety and security of your information. Our Third Party Partners have explicit privacy policies that guarantees the security and safety of your information. However, we do not bind Third Party Partners to meeting every standard of our own privacy policy.
