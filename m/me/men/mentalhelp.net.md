However, you should keep in mind that this might prevent you from taking full advantage of the Site by removing or altering access to some of its pages and features, now or in the future. 

Another website traffic analysis tool that we use are web beacons; tiny graphic images that provide information about your Site visit, such as the pages you viewed, whether or not you open and/or act upon one of our emails, notifications or advertisements and other features you use on your visit.

Additionally, we may collect the URL of the website you visited immediately prior to coming to our Website. We reserve the right to work with other service providers that help us track, analyze and collect this information.
