# Mental Health Net - Privacy Statement

How Mental Health Net values your privacy and security. 

Our privacy statement was the result of Mental Health Net's [participation](https://web.archive.org/archives/editor26.htm) in the [American Association for the Advancement of Science's](http://www.aaas.org/) _Anonymous Communications on the Internet_ conference, November 21-23, 1997 in Irvine, California. |  |

Mental Health Net gathers information about our customers that allows us to offer compelling and easily accessible online content in a manner that provides personal privacy protection as well:   
**   ** | Occasionally we ask you to provide us information such as your name, your gender, or your e-mail address. You never have to answer these questions, although this may limit what services are offered to your through MHN (e.g., you may not be able to participate in our community functions).   
**   ** | We catalog traffic patterns throughout the site.  
**   ** | We use an _optional feature_ of your browser called a "cookie" to assign a "User ID"  when you visit our community areas -- our discussion forums or our chat rooms. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. Your Mental Health Net User ID automatically identifies your computer -- but not you -- to our servers when you visit our site. **Unless you specifically tell us, Mental Health Net will never know who you are, even though we assign your computer a cookie. Cookie use is completely optional.**  
**   ** | Other companies which place advertising on our site also have the ability to assign a different cookie to you in a process that Mental Health Net does not control. But since cookies aren't usable for identifying individuals (you'll be just a number to them), these advertisers will never know who you are - **and Mental Health Net will never tell them!   **

Mental Health Net is trying to always provide you with a compelling reason to come back and visit our site again:  
**   ** | We analyze what our customers like and don't like about Mental Health Net's current offerings so that we can design better services.  
**   ** | We **do not** use information about what you are searching for to help focus the advertisements we present to you. We also **do not** track search engine usage.  
**   ** | We regularly **remove** outdated postings from our discussion forums. We will also remove any posting to our discussion forums or mailing list archives from any individual author if they [let us know](https://web.archive.org/rateus.htm).  
**   ** | We regularly **remove** users and all of their identifying information from our computer systems when their accounts have become inactive (no usage for longer than 6 months) or their e-mail address expires.   
**   ** | We develop summary -- not individual -- reports for our advertisers.  An example of a summary report might be "200 people clicked on your advertisement "X" today." Advertisers use this information to track the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. Advertising on MHN allows us to bring our services to you at absolutely no cost. We **never** tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements.  
**   ** |  If you are a subscriber to our monthly newsletter, twice monthly we will send you an e-mail newsletter to provide information which we think you will find useful, including information about new products and services from Mental Health Net. Mental Health Net uses the services of [Postmaster General](http://www.postmastergeneral.com/) (a separate company from MHN) to help with the mailing of our newsletter. Postmaster General's [privacy policy](http://www.postmastergeneral.com/privacy.html) protects the privacy and security of your email address on our subscription list. 

It is our policy only to send our newsletter to individuals who give us permission to do so. In every such e-mail, we have instructions on how to unsubscribe so that you will not receive any future e-mails from Mental Health Net if you do not wish to. You are **not subscribed** to this newsletter automatically -- you must voluntarily ask to receive it.  
  
**  Distribution of the Information**  
  
---  
The individually identifiable information that you provide will **only** be used within Mental Health Net. We do not share **any personal information** you provide to us (including, but not limited to, your name, e-mail address, and related information) to **any** outside party for any reason whatsoever. Let us make this absolutely clear:  
   
  
**Mental Health Net will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its users to any third party without first receiving that individual's permission.**  
  
   
Other companies which place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising or content. Mental Health Net does not control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers or content providers directly if you have any questions about their use of this information. Additionally, Mental Health Net does not control the information collection and distribution policies on sites off of Mental Health Net, although we do encourage our other sites to adopt privacy policies similar to this one.

Mental Health Net works with a third party that serves ads to this site. To find out more about how flycast manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, please go to <http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html>.

Mental Health Net puts control over communications directed to you where it belongs: **In your hands**. Every time we collect name and address information about you:   
**   ** | You can tell us if you don't want to be listed in service directories, such as user listings in our chat rooms.  
**   ** | You can tell us if you don't want to receive communication from Mental Health Net such as our e-mail newsletter.  
**   ** | And, of course, you can always decline to provide the personal information to us in the first place.  
  
**  Correcting & Deleting Your Information**

You can currently update your information in our discussion forums and chat rooms. Choose "Options" in any [discussion forum](http://forums.mentalhelp.net/) to change your user information there, and "Profile" in our [chat rooms](http://mentalhelp.net/chat/) to update your user information there. 

We regularly **remove** users and all of their identifying information from our computer systems when their accounts have become inactive (no usage for longer than 6 months) or their e-mail address expires.
