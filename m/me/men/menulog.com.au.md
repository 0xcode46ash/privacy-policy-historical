**The information we collect**  
When You lodge a booking, place a takeaway order, purchase a restaurant voucher or rate/review a restaurant via the Menulog web site, we need to collect information about You in order to enable us to deliver our service. This information includes, but is not limited to, details such as your name, your contact details, your delivery address, your requirements and relevant booking information. 

**How we use the information**  
If You decide to complete an on-line form, the information that you enter into the on-line form will be collected and saved by us. The information You supply to us is used to assess your requirements and to enable the relevant restaurant or takeaway delivery partner to contact You in response to your enquiry. 

It is a condition of your use of the Menulog website that you agree to allow your data to be disclosed to these third parties and for them to establish contact with you. If at any point in time you would like your saved data to be deleted from our system, please contact us and we will arrange to have your records deleted from our database. 

As a user of our service, You may occasionally receive email or SMS updates from us about new products or services being offered by Menulog, along with newsletters, noteworthy changes to the website and any other material we deem relevant. You can always unsubscribe and opt out from receiving these messages. 

Unless otherwise prohibited by law or our contractual obligations, we may disclose personal information if required to do so by law, court order, or as requested by a governmental or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable. Such situations may include: to perform, maintain or enforce contracts with our users or suppliers; to protect the rights or properties of Menulog, our business affiliates, our users, or others; or when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing, or who may be threatening to cause, interference with or damage to our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise; or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. 

Like most websites, there is certain information we automatically track, including the URL that You just came from, the browser You are using and your IP address. This data is utilised to improve the services of Menulog and does not include any personally identifying information. 

**O ur commitment to data security**  
All user details captured by Menulog are stored securely at all times and will never be provided to any unauthorised third parties. While being transmitted over the Internet, all credit card details are protected using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. Menulog has been verified for security and compliance to SSL standards by Comodo, an independent third party. Credit card details are handled using DPS, a leading provider of secure credit card processing solutions. For the avoidance of doubt, Menulog will not in any circumstances be liable to You, or third parties, for loss or damage arising from credit card fraud or identity theft.

 **Cookies**  
We may, from time to time, use "cookies" to store your preferences, record session information and collect information on how You visit and access our Web pages. We collect information on the Web pages visited by our customers in order to help us to continue improving our services. 

"Cookies" are pieces of information that our Web page transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard and many Web sites use them to provide useful features for You. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify You, only your computer. 

**Opting out of promotional information**  
We at Menulog work hard to provide our clients with the best possible service at all times. From time to time, we will send our members newsletters, updates and other useful information. We hope that you will find these items informative and useful. However, should you choose to not receive them in the future, you will have the ability to unsubscribe from the mail database by following the Unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email. 

 **How to contact us**  
This policy may be revised from time to time, as new features are added to the site or the legislation changes. Please check back periodically for updates and additions.
