# Men's Health I Privacy policy

  


The MensHealth.co.uk website (the "Site") is owned by Rodale Limited and is committed to safeguarding your privacy. This statement explains what happens to the information you supply on our website and the control you have over it. 

EMAIL NEWSLETTERS 

When signing up for our weekly emails we typically ask that you provide us with your first and surname, age, gender, postcode, country and email address. We will send you an email to confirm that we have received your details. 

The information you supply is used to send out news by email and to get in touch with you where necessary. You may opt out of these mailings at the sign up stage. 

Instructions to securely remove yourself from our mailing list can be found at the end of every email you receive from us. 

Occasionally, mailings prepared several months in advance may include a customer's name, even after a customer has asked to be removed from our mailing lists. 

As a result, the customer may receive mail for one or two months after the request. We apologize for this inconvenience, and we will make sure that mailing lists prepared after such a request will reflect a customer's preference not to receive our mail.
