# Men's Health I Privacy policy

  


Men's Health is committed to safeguarding your privacy. This statement explains what happens to the information you supply on our website and the control you have over it. 

MEN'S HEALTH WEEKLY 

We typically ask that you provide us with your first and surname, age, gender, postcode, country and email address. We will send you an email to confirm that we have received your details. 

The information you supply is used to send out news by email and to get in touch with you where necessary. 

Sometimes Men's Health makes its list of customer names and addresses available to carefully screened organizations. Outside of these organizations, we will not disclose any information unless required to do so by law or other regulatory authority. We will advise all our readers of the general intended use of such information upon request. 

While we require partner organisations to follow appropriate privacy policies, we are not responsible for their actions. 

You may opt out of these mailings at the sign up stage. 

Instructions to securely remove yourself from our mailing list can be found at the end of every email you receive from us. 

Occasionally, mailings prepared several months in advance may include a customer's name, even after a customer has asked to be removed from our mailing lists. As a result, the customer may receive mail for one or two months after the request. We apologize for this inconvenience, and we will make sure that mailing lists prepared after such a request will reflect a customer's preference not to receive our mail. 

IF WE ASK FOR MORE INFO... 

Sometimes we require for more specific information from you, for example when you enter a competition or purchase a product. 

You may be asked for your name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, type of computer. And we may request more details about your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, the types of jobs you are interested in, for example, in an effort to deliver to you the best possible site experience. 

The information we gather may be used to make you aware of additional products and services, which may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding site changes. 

We do not make personal information such as telephone number, email address and credit card details available to outside parties, except when we believe the law requires it. But we may record and share aggregated information with our partners. 

WHO CAN ACCESS MY DETAILS? 

Men's Health will limit access to reader information on a 'need to know' basis and to only those employees responsible for conducting business with our customers. We recognize the responsibility that comes with handling information and will apply stringent security measures to safeguard information about our customers. 

AUTOMATICALLY LOGGED INFORMATION 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. 

EXTERNAL LINKS 

Our sites contain advertisements and links to other sites which allow users to leave our pages. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, policies or the content of such Web sites. 

SECURITY 

Our site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. All user databases are password protected. 

CHILDREN 

We do not specifically collect information about children. We believe that children should get their parents' consent before giving out personal information. All sensitive areas of the site require confirmation that you are 18 before continuing. Internet Explorer users can block access to such pages by turning 'ratings' on in the 'Preferences' menu of the browser. 

CHANGES TO THIS POLICY 

Any changes to our privacy commitment will be posted here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
