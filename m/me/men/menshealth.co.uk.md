Men's Health is committed to safeguarding your privacy. This statement explains what happens to the information you supply on our website and the control you have over it. 

If you have any questions our policy, or your dealings with this site you can contact our internet editor, Will Callaghan. 

Men's Health weekly 

  * On signing up to our weekly email newsletter we ask that you provide us with your first and surname, age, gender, postcode, country and email address. We will send you an email to confirm that we have received your details.
  * The information you supply is used to send out news by email and to get in touch with you where necessary. 
  * Sometimes Men's Health makes its list of customer names and addresses available to carefully screened organizations. Outside of these organizations, we will not disclose any information unless required to do so by law or other regulatory authority. We will advise all our readers of the general intended use of such information upon request.
  * While we require partner organisations to follow appropriate privacy policies, we are not responsible for their actions.
  * You may opt out of these mailings at the sign up stage.
  * Instructions to securely remove yourself from our mailing list can be found at the end of every email you receive from us.
  * Occasionally, mailings prepared several months in advance may include a customer's name, even after a customer has asked to be removed from our mailing lists. As a result, the customer may receive mail for one or two months after the request. We apologize for this inconvenience, and we will make sure that mailing lists prepared after such a request will reflect a customer's preference not to receive our mail. 



If we ask for more details 

  * Sometimes we require for more specific information from you, for example when you enter a competition or purchase a product. 
  * You may be asked for your name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, type of computer. And we may request more details about your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, the types of jobs you are interested in, for example, in an effort to deliver to you the best possible site experience. 
  * The information we gather may be used to make you aware of additional products and services, which may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding site changes. 
  * We do not make personal information such as telephone number, email address and credit card details available to outside parties, except when we believe the law requires it. But we may record and share aggregated information with our partners.
