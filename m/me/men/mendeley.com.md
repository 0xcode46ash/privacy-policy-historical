### MENDELEY PRINCIPLES

Our mission is to help you manage and share your research data. Besides the data which you openly disclose on our website (e.g. public profile information, comments in public discussions), you can also back up your research library to your individual account on Mendeley Web. When you do so, this means that information about the articles on your computer will be stored on our servers. We understand that this data contains private and confidential information, and we will do everything to preserve this privacy.

In treating your data, Mendeley follows three core principles:

**1\. Data is only uploaded when you are signed in.**  
Data is only uploaded to your Mendeley account when you have entered your account details into the Mendeley Desktop software. 

**2\. You decide which data to share, and with whom.**  
Mendeley will never publish private or personally identifiable data. No one will ever know what you are currently researching or reading, unless you explicitly decide to share this data with other researchers. In addition, it is your decision whether to share this data with selected colleagues only, or with the entire Mendeley community. 

**3\. Your data and your content is owned by you.**  
Whatever personal data and original content you upload to your Mendeley account is owned by you. We do not claim any ownership rights over your research. Of course, you can delete your data at any time. 

From all registered and signed-in users' individual accounts, we anonymously aggregate document details, tags and statistics, some of which will be made available to the Mendeley community. Nothing about you personally can be inferred from the aggregated statistics. One example: The Mendeley community will be able to see that a certain paper had 7,153 readers and was the most popular paper in Biology last week. However, nobody except you will know whether you were one of these 7,153 readers.

Mendeley also uses information extracted from files imported into signed-in users’ Mendeley software to help improve the discovery of published research on the Mendeley service. Snippets of documents in signed-in users’ Mendeley software may in the future form part of the search and recommendation results displayed by Mendeley. Mendeley does not display the full-text of such documents without the user’s or the publisher’s permission. If you do not want snippets of documents to appear in such results on Mendeley, you should not import these documents into your Mendeley software while you are signed in to the service.

We believe that aggregating the data in this way benefits both you and the academic community at large, because it

  * improves the automatic document recognition in Mendeley Desktop (see [Automatic Document Details Extraction](https://web.archive.org/faq/#automatic-metadata-extraction "Automatic Document Details Extraction")),
  * allows you unprecedented insights into the statistics and research trends of your academic discipline,
  * gives you a better understanding of your own research habits and document collection,
  * enables us to provide you with a research paper recommendation engine,
  * lets you evaluate your impact on the research community,
  * enables you to discover the most interesting people in your academic discipline,
  * helps to create the world's largest academic database, open and accessible to everyone.



We hope you find these principles useful, understandable, and acceptable. For the full-length "legal language" version, please have a look at our Privacy Policy below. If you have questions, ideas, or concerns, please send them to .
