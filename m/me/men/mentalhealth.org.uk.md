###### About text donation

Text donation is an easy and simple way to donate. If a service is advertised as a text donation service then the money is taken from your mobile phone account or pre-pay balance and paid to us by your network.

If you make a text donation Mental Health Foundation (registered charity number 801130) will receive 100% of your donation(s). You may also be charged for one text message each time you text us at your network’s charity or network rate. Always get the bill payer's permission.  

If you contact us by text and subsequently wish to change your mind about future contact, please reply NO INFO to any future text from us.

If you access the Internet from a mobile phone you may incur data charges. Please ensure that the connection you use is secure and take reasonable security precautions when clicking any URL or filling in any mobile web form that we might send to you.

We use a company called Vir2 to provide a text helpline for dealing with any issues related to text donation services. Call 0330 660 0425. Please do not use this number for contacting the charity – it is purely for any issues that you may have about our text donation services.
