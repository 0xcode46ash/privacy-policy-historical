## Privacy Notice for hue

Philips believes strongly in protecting the privacy of the personal data you share with us. We also believe it is important to inform you about how we will use your personal data, and to give you choices about how those data will be used. Therefore, we encourage you to read this Privacy Notice carefully, before you make your choices and give us the right to use your data as stated in this Privacy Notice.

#### Scope of this Privacy Notice

Please note that you can use the Products from within your home via the App “Local Access”. In order to also use the Products from outside your home you will need to have a hue account, which you can create on the Web Site “Remote Access”. With a hue account you will be able to control your Products from within and from outside the home, via the App and via the Web Site. It is important for you to know that once you have created a hue account you will always access the Products via the Remote Access mode also when using the Products within the home, unless you reset your bridge.

#### Do we share information on the Products with third parties?

If you choose to use a product, application or other services from a third party that can be connected to our Products Philips will share information on the configuration of your Products to these third parties. Note that these third parties often have their own privacy policies that apply to the way they use your personal data. These privacy policies sometimes differ from the Philips Privacy Notice.

We may share this personal data with service providers, business partners and others, consistent with applicable law.

For example, Philips may sell you a product or offer you a service in a joint marketing effort with another company (Business Partner). We will let you know that such relationship exists and who these companies are, prior to processing your data for such joint marketing efforts.

If we are required by law to obtain your consent, or otherwise believe that your consent is appropriate in the circumstances, we will obtain your consent before we share your personal data.

Our agreements with these Business Partners will limit the purposes for which your personal data can be used and disclosed, and will require your personal data to be adequately safeguarded.

Philips will disclose personal data only under this policy and/or when required by law.
