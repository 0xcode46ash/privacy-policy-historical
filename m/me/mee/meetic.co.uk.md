## 5.3. Who has access to your information?

The information gathered about you when you register with Meetic and subscribe to our Services is used to offer you our different Services. All precautions have been taken on our databases to archive your information in a secure environment. Only a small number of our employees have access to your information, which is only accessible in case of necessity. The personal information you provide at the time of registration which does not comprise your personal ad and your profile will not be accessible by third parties, nor passed on, sold or exchanged, except in the cases named below and subject to your prior information and agreement, or in assumption of your non opposition hereto.

We may send you promotional offers from some of our partners, subject to your explicit and informed consent given during registration, unless you oppose to it during your registration or at any moment thereafter. If you do not wish to recieve any special offers from Meetic or our partner companies let us know when you subscribe, or alternatively at any time through the area entitled "My Account" on the Meetic site, or by post.

Meetic may occasionally share general socio-demographic information that does not include names with selected partners to allow them to target their announcements (by age category, gender, etc.). In this case, we will not send these partners any information that would allow them to identify you.

The information contained in your personal ad, your search criteria and your profile can be accessed on Meetic, on the web, by email (newsletters), by cellular telephone or on Meetic's Audiotel Service (a value-added telephone Service). In addition, these information may be broadcasted directly by Meetic or via our partners to persons interested in Meetic, through newsletters or third-party websites, or by all other electronic (email, SMS, etc.) or audiovisual (radio, television, etc.) communication tools, or by written press (newspapers, magazines, etc.), in order to increase your chances of meeting someone by promoting your person ads, search criteria and profile.

Consequently, the Member explicitly authorizes Meetic to reproduce and broadcast the information contained in his/her personal ad, search criteria or profile (personal information, description, images, videos, etc.) on all or part of the Meetic Services (on the Meetic site, on the Web, by email, Audiotel) and/or in a general manner, on all distribution media, in particular audiovisual communication (press, radio, analogue television, digital television, cable or satellite) or electronic communication (email, Internet), throughout the entire world and for the length of time established in these Terms of Use between the Member and Meetic. Furthermore, the Member explicitly authorizes Meetic to transfer the benefits of the above mentioned rights to its partners and eventual successors of Meetic.

If you no longer wish for Meetic or its partners to reproduce or broadcast the information comprised in your personal ad, your search criteria, or your profile, you can terminate your Meetic account following the conditions foreseen in the Article "Termination". Since this information is comprised of your personal ad, your search criteria and your profile, the termination will only take effect upon the next update or version of these communications (printed, press, audiovisual, or electronic) containing your personal ad, your search criteria and your profile information.
