# MeetEdgar Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to Roeder Studios, Inc., the owner and operator of the Edgar application, and we are committed to protecting your personal information. In this policy, we are letting you know about the ways we collect and use your information, so you can make an informed choice regarding whether you will use Edgar.

By using Edgar, you consent to the terms of this policy.

This privacy policy was last changed on July 23rd, 2014.

 **What Information Do We Collect?**

When you sign up to use Edgar, we collect your name, email address, IP address, credit card information, and other information necessary to process your transaction.

When you link your Edgar account with supported Social Media Platform such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, we may have access to information regarding your Social Media Platform accounts, and you will be notified at that time regarding what information we can access.

We collect non-identifiable personal information through the use of “cookies.” A cookie is a small data file that a Web site can transfer to your hard drive through your browser. The cookie is then stored on your computer as an anonymous tag. You can set your browser to notify you if cookies are received. If you choose to set up your browser to not accept cookies, you will not be able to use Edgar.

We may collect some other personally identifying information about your transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information, to be analyzed only at an aggregate level. We will use anonymized data from your account to improve the service for all customers. We will not use the content you post except to internally improve our systems.

 **How Do We Use Your Information?**

We use your name and email to send you periodic emails, including email newsletters and occasional business announcements and updates.

We use your credit card to process your transaction. We may use your email to contact you about your account.

We use cookies to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so we can optimize our website and create a better user experience for you.

 **Do We Respond to Do Not Track Signals?**

Do Not Track is a privacy setting you can change in your website browser, so your activities cannot be tracked from website to website. We do not respond to Do Not Track signals in browsers, because we do not track your activities across different websites.

 **How Do You Unsubscribe?**

You must maintain a working email adderss associated with your Edgar account, so you can receive email regarding your Edgar account. However, if at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving promotional emails, you can opt-out by unsubscribing at the bottom of any email we send to you.

 **How Do We Protect Your Information?**

We use various security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information, including hosting your data on a secure server and/or a third-party password-protected, secure service. Any third-party secure service we use will keep your information confidential, will not sell or share your information, and will not contact you directly. Billing and payment data are encrypted whenever transmitted or received online.

We share your information with specific third parties who assist us in taking care of you (such as the password-protected, secure service above), who agree to keep your information confidential. We will also release your information as required by law or if necessary to protect our legal rights, to comply with a judicial proceeding or court order, to prevent abuse of Edgar, or to prevent threats to others or illegal activities.

We have no control over how the various Social Media Platforms collect or use your identifying information that you supply to them. Please refer to the privacy policies of those companies for more information about how they use your information.

Circumstances may arise where we may decide to sell, buy, merge, or otherwise reorganize our business in the United States or elsewhere, or where we may decide to share, rent, buy, or sell business assets for the purpose of reorganizing, developing, or expanding our business. It is our policy to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions. In the event that our entire company or the Edgar application asset is acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.

 **Information Regarding Children**

We do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. This website, products, and services are not directed to people who are under 13 years of age. Please notify us at support@meetedgar.com. if you are a parent whose child has provided us with personally identifying information, and we will delete such information from our files.
