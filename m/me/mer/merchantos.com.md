We may use “persistent state” files ("cookies", "flash local storage", "HTML5 local storage", etc. - collectively "persistent cookies") to collect information on our websites. Persistent cookies are data that we transfer to your computer's storage system(s) for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes.

Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by visitors and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Services. We may use third party services including, but not limited to, Google Analytics, to help understand your use of our Services. These services collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address, and their use of this information is governed by their Privacy Policy. 

We anonymously aggregate user data to understand and report on geographic areas of activity (e.g. top cities). In the future we may also anonymously aggregate user-generated content and present this data to our user community. We may use this information to create market trend reports that can be used by our users, their clients and the market at large. We will use this information to develop the product and improve service to our users. We may use this information to market the services of LightSpeed to prospective clients.
