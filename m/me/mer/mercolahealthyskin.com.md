# Mercola Policy on Security, Privacy and Website Terms of Use - Mercola.com

## Effective Date: 4/2/2014

[](https://privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/Mercola-com/validation?rid=25d2a2d6-712e-4176-8b4f-67002e042b9f "TRUSTe online privacy certification")

This policy sets forth the type of information [Mercola.com](http://www.mercola.com/) collects from you via this website: [www.mercola.com](http://www.mercola.com/) (the "Website"), the way we use such information, and the procedures we use to keep such information confidential.

[Mercola.com](http://www.mercola.com/) takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users' personal information. When users submit sensitive information via the [Mercola.com](http://www.mercola.com/) website, their information is protected both online and off-line.

By using the Website, you consent to the collection and use of certain information in the manner we describe and agree to be bound by the terms of use as set forth herein. By logging into your cart, you consent to periodic email notifications regarding the status of your check-out process. You may opt out of these any time after your initial notice.

The practices and policies contained in this Policy are subject to change at any time without prior notice. If we decide to change our policies, we will post those changes on this Website. Information collected before changes are made will be secured according to the Policy in place at the time such information is collected notwithstanding future changes to this Policy. The practices and policies in this Policy replace all previous notices or statements with respect to the same subject matter. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

## Opt-out or Termination of User Accounts

If users have opted out of all communication with the Website, or deleted/deactivated their account, [Mercola.com](http://www.mercola.com/) will not contact such users again nor will their personal information ever be used by us in any manner.

If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please [contact us](http://shop.mercola.com/pages/ContactUs.aspx).

You may also contact us at:

Hoffman Estates, IL 60169

We are committed to preventing others from unauthorized access to the personal information you provide to us, and we maintain commercially reasonable procedures and technology designed for this purpose. The Website has reasonable technical and organizational security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those security measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information, such as credit card number, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry, 128-bit SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.

While we use 128-bit SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.

## The Information We Collect

We request information from the user on our secure order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. We may store this information securely on our server. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. This information is only shared with other companies who work on behalf of [Mercola.com](http://www.mercola.com/) to provide a product or service to you. Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us. We may also use this information to inform you of additional goods and services about which you might be interested or to customize your experience and use of the Website.

We may ask you for personally-identifying information in connection with a promotion or survey. Any email you receive from us, or third parties authorized by you to send email, will contain additional opt-out or unsubscribe options in the email with instructions on how to unsubscribe from receiving future emails.

If you want to send an item to your friend, like a gift card, we will ask for your friend's first name, last name, and email address. We will only use this information to complete your order and send the item to your friend. [Mercola.com](http://www.mercola.com/) stores this information for the sole purpose of processing this order and tracking the success of your order. Your friend may contact us at <http://shop.mercola.com/pages/ContactUs.aspx> to request that we remove this information from our database. 

We may automatically gather general statistical information about our website and visitors, such as IP addresses, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors, goods and services purchased, transactions completed, etc. To do this, we use action tags and cookies provided by our site analytics and marketing partners. Although these partners log the information coming from our site on our behalf, we authorize how that data may and may not be used.

We do not knowingly collect or use personal information from children under 13 without containing verifiable consent from their parents. We have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who address our website, and so we carry out the same Privacy Policy for individuals of all ages. If a child has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the information and opt out of promotional opportunities. For more information about the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), visit <http://www.coppa.org/>.

Like most standard website servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

## Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. These are used to keep track of your shopping cart, as well as track activity around the site so that we can better tailor our layout to your needs. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. These are used to remember you when you come back to the site, and to serve advertisements that apply to you and the products that you have shown interest in. You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" directory. For more information, please visit: <https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/61416?hl=en>

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. 

We also use clear gifs (a.k.a. Web beacons), that help us better manage the content of our site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personal information. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”

The use of cookies by our partners is covered by our privacy policy. We do have access or control over these cookies. Our partners use session ID and persistent cookies to ensure that our advertisements are relevant to your interests. 

Our third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our site. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers' or Users' personally identifiable information.

## The Way We Use Information

Our goal is to provide products that best meet your needs, therefore we evaluate your personal interactions with us in an effort to bring you the products which best suit your tastes. In addition, we use your information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's content, layout, and services.

We may use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, new products, services and promotions. At times we may ask you to provide us voluntarily with additional information regarding your personal or business interests, experience or requests, which we may use to customize our products and services for you.

If you place a request for products or services, we use your personal information to ship your order; if the products or services are from a retail partner, we may provide your relevant information to that retailer for purposes of the transaction. If you establish a credit account with us or our providers, we collect additional information, including billing information, credit card number and expiration date, and tracking information from checks or money orders.

If [Mercola.com](http://www.mercola.com/) is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

We may also use or disclose information to resolve disputes or investigate problems. We may disclose or access information whenever we believe in good faith that the law so requires or if we otherwise consider it necessary to do so to maintain service and improve our products and services.

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, to manage our website and to enhance our site based on the usage pattern data we receive.

If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend or delete it by making the change on your [member information page](https://web.archive.org/profile/myaccount.aspx), or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.
