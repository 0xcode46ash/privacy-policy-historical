# Mercury Insurance - Privacy Statement

Mercury and its affiliated companies appreciate the trust you place in us when you ask us to help protect you and your assets. You trust us with your private, personal information when you purchase insurance from us, and we are committed to protecting this information. Mercury does not sell information about you to others.

## Mercury's Use Of Your Personal Information

We treat your information with respect and concern for your privacy. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted or required by law.

For example, we may share any or all of your information with our affiliated companies. We may also disclose any or all information we have collected about you to companies that perform services on our behalf.

When we make this type of disclosure it is done to service your Mercury account or policy, or to inform you about Mercury products and services. Before disclosing your information, we require these companies to agree to keep it confidential and use it only for the transaction we request.

## Independent Mercury Agents and Brokers

The Independent Insurance Agents/Brokers authorized to sell Mercury products and services are not Mercury employees and are subject to Mercury's Privacy Policy only insofar as they sell or service our products. Because they have a unique business relationship with you, they may have additional personal information about you that Mercury does not have. They may use this information differently than Mercury. Contact your Mercury Agent/Broker or advisor to learn more about their privacy practices.
