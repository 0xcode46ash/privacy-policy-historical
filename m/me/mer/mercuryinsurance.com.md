**Mercury's Sources of Information About You**

We collect personal information about you from:

  * The information you provide on applications or other forms (such as your name, address and Social Security number)
  * Your transactions with us (such as your payment history and claims information)
  * The information we receive from a consumer reporting agency (such as your credit history, except in California)

**Mercury's Use of Your Personal Information**

We treat your information with respect and concern for your privacy. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law.

For example, we may share any or all of your information with our affiliated companies. We may also disclose any or all information we have collected about you to companies that perform services on our behalf.

When we make this type of disclosure it is done to service your Mercury account or policy, or to inform you about Mercury products and services. Before disclosing your information, we require these companies to promise to keep it confidential and use it only for the transaction we request.

**Independent Mercury Agents and Brokers**

The Independent Insurance Agents/Brokers authorized to sell Mercury products and services are not Mercury employees and are subject to Mercuryâ€™s Privacy Policy only insofar as they sell or service our products. Because they have a unique business relationship with you, they may have additional personal information about you that Mercury does not have. They may use this information differently than Mercury. Contact your Mercury Agent/Broker or advisor to learn more about their privacy practices.

**Information About Mercury's Web Sites**

**Information collected**

Mercury collects personal information (for example, name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or social security number) on our web site only when you voluntarily provide it to us. Only your Internet domain is recognized when you visit our website; your individual e-mail address is not.

**Information sharing and use**

Mercury does not sell information about you to others. If you only browse our web site and do not supply any information, you will not receive unsolicited e-mail, telephone calls, or other marketing materials from Mercury as a result of your visit.

When you make changes to your account or request more information about our products we may forward information you supply to us to your Mercury Independent Insurance Agent/Broker. We do this so they can service your account or contact you with additional information about our products.

**Protecting Your Personal Information from Unauthorized Access**

We limit employee access to customer information to those employees with a legitimate business reason for such access. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information from being accessed by unauthorized persons. We also conduct regular risk assessment, risk management and control, and oversight of our service providers to assure the effectiveness of these safeguards.

**Your Medical Information**
