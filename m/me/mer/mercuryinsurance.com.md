The information collected through these web beacons is used to find out more about our users, including user demographics and usage patterns, for more accurate reporting and to improve the effectiveness of our marketing. Information recorded through the use of these web beacons is aggregated and then shared with us.

Mercury and its affiliated companies appreciate the trust you place in us when you ask us to help protect you and your assets. You trust us with your private, personal information when you purchase insurance from us. We are committed to protecting your private information. Mercury does not sell information about you to others.

**To learn more about how Mercury collects and uses your personal information, please read the following notice.**

We collect personal information about you from:

  * The information you provide on applications or other forms (such as your name, address and Social Security number) 
  * Your transactions with us (such as your payment history and claims information)
  * The information we receive from a consumer reporting agency (such as your credit history, except in California)
  * Your insurance Agent/Broker (such as updated information pertaining to your account)



We treat your information with respect and concern for your privacy. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law.

For example, we may share any or all of your information with our affiliated companies and independent Mercury representatives and Independent Insurance Agents/Brokers authorized to sell Mercury products. We may also disclose any or all information we have collected about you to companies that perform services on our behalf with whom we have joint marketing agreements.

When we make this type of disclosure it is done to service your Mercury account or policy, or to inform you about Mercury products and services. Before disclosing your information, we require these companies to promise to keep it confidential and use it only for the transaction we request.

The Independent Insurance Agents/Brokers authorized to sell Mercury products and services are not Mercury employees and not subject to Mercuryâ€™s Privacy Policy. Because they have a unique business relationship with you, they may have additional personal information about you that Mercury does not have. They may use this information differently than Mercury. Contact your Mercury Agent/Broker or advisor to learn more about their privacy practices

Mercury collects personal information (for example, name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or social security number) on our web site only when you voluntarily provide it to us. Only your Internet domain is recognized when you visit our website; your individual e-mail address is not.

**Information sharing and use**  
Mercury does not sell information about you to others. If you only browse our web site and do not supply any information, you will not receive unsolicited e-mail, telephone calls, or other marketing materials from Mercury as a result of your visit.

When you make changes to your account or request more information about our products we may forward information you supply to us to your Mercury Independent Insurance Agent/Broker. We do this so they can service your account or contact you with additional information about our products.
