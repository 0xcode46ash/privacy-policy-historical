[Mercury Center](http://www.mercurycenter.com/) is a part of the [Real Cities Network (RCN)](http://www.realcities.com/), a national network of Web sites in the United States. Mercury Center, along with the Real Cities Network, is committed to protecting your privacy. The following FAQ for both Mercury Center and the entire Real Cities Network should answer most of your important questions. However, if you still have concerns, please send email to [sjm_passport_feedback@realcities.com](mailto:sjm_passport_feedback@realcities.com).

In order to provide convenient and personalized service to our Web site visitors, Mercury Center uses a variety of systems to collect and store customer information. You can take advantage of these systems by signing up for a Passport. As a Passport holder, you will enjoy a growing range of interactive features, including community sites, free email, chat rooms, shopping guide, email news dispatches, valuable promotions and sweepstakes, premium content, and more. 

In addition to improving your online experience, knowing a bit more about you allows _us_ to display advertising to you in a more intelligent fashion.  Targeted advertisements are probably more interesting for you, and they are definitely more productive for our advertisers. 

For all these reasons, Passports are an exciting development for Real Cities sites. We understand how important your privacy is to you, and we hope that the following answers will reassure you that the information you have given us will not be misused.

**Does Mercury Center ask for personal information?**   
Yes. A Real Cities Passport consists of four basic elements: a login name, a password, an email address, and a postal code.  Over time, however, your Passport will grow with you. For example, when we introduce the ability to share Passport information, you may wish to create a public profile in order to let other Passport holders get to know you better. When we introduce interactive features, such as personalized news or classified agents, you will be able to add these preferences to your Passport as well, so you don't have to keep retyping them. Also, any time you take advantage of special promotions or sweepstakes for Passport holders, we will add any additional data collected to your Passport record.

**What other information does Mercury Center collect?**   
In order to determine what the most popular areas of our site are, Mercury Center also keeps track of on-site traffic, i.e. page views and ad impressions. Over time, in order to anticipate your needs and to improve the product, we may link these usage patterns with individual customers or groups of customers.

**How does Mercury Center use this information?**   
Mercury Center uses customer information in non-intrusive, common sense ways. First, storing user identity and preference information allows Mercury Center to greet you when you return to the site as well as to keep track of your onsite preferences, such as Email News subscriptions. Second, Mercury Center writers and product managers review our customer information in aggregate in order to better understand who our audience is and what you want. Finally, tracking customer information allows us to sell targeted advertising. While we may not always get it right, we think that you will be more interested in banner ads that have something to do with your news interests and/or home Zip Code. Targeted ads are also far more efficient for advertisers. This is especially good because advertising dollars pay the bills and allow us to provide Mercury Center to you for free.

**How does Mercury Center target advertising?**   
When a Passport holder makes use of one of our services, such as a dispatches of sports stories delivered via email, we "remember" that the user is interested in sports. Then, when an advertiser wants to reach an audience of sports fans, we simply serve the advertisements to those users who we have been flagged as sports fans. Alternatively, if a local grocery market wants to inform its customers of an upcoming sale, we can display that advertisement to Passport holders with relevant Zip Codes. It is important to note that in such cases it is our policy NOT to share the details of your Passport information with the advertiser. We act as the middleman between you and the companies that want to reach you.

**Will Mercury Center disclose any of my personal information?**   
Mercury Center will disclose personal information in some limited circumstances. When Mercury Center intends to disclose information, the purpose will be explained to you beforehand:  
\- From time to time, Mercury Center will run sweepstakes or promotions for Passport holders. In most cases, you will be required to provide additional information on in order to participate in the event, and some of this data may be provided to the sponsor of the promotion. Of course, we will explain the nature of the promotion, and you will always have the option not to participate in it. Also, you will not be signed up without your express consent.  
\- Mercury Center does disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, 55% of our users come from the Southwest) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. However, aggregate data is not traceable to a specific user.  
\- When Mercury Center decides to integrate 3rd party services which depend upon customer information, such as online email or personalized stock quotes, we may share some elements of our customer records (such as an email address) with the third party. Such partners, as well as Internet sites and services accessible through Mercury Center, may have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of Mercury Center. It is our policy to notify you of any differences between their policies and our own. However, Mercury Center has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or the actions of non-affiliated third parties.  
\- It is important to note that although Mercury Center will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your personal information, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. Mercury Center will have no liability for disclosure of data due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties.  
\- Finally, Mercury Center will cooperate fully should a situation arise where we are required by law or legal process to provide information about a customer.

**Will Mercury Center use my information for direct mailings?**   
Only with your permission. With your express consent, we will send you information about our products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. Only Mercury Center (or agents working on behalf of Mercury Center) will send you these direct mailings. At any time you can easily update your Passport such that you no longer receive such offers and mailings. 

Back to questions | Top  


**Does Mercury Center use Cookies and IP Addresses?**   
Yes. If you choose "Automatic Login" when you sign up for a Passport, Mercury Center stores a scrambled version of your Passport login name in a permanent "Cookie" file on your hard drive so that we can remember who you are from one visit to the next. If you do not choose "Automatic Login", we will use a temporary Cookie after you log in (which expires after each visit) to keep track of you as you move from page to page during a given visit to our site. Without these Cookies, it is impossible for us to provide any level of personalized service or to target advertising. In addition, some of our sites and advertising systems may set additional cookies which contain no personal information whatsoever. 

In order to enable automatic log in as well as fast entry to our various services, Passport keeps three key data elements in your Cookie: your Passport Login Name, Zip Code, and Email Address. To protect your privacy, each cookie is scrambled using a proprietary encryption algorithm. Think of these Cookies as "claim checks". Like a coat room clerk, we use the Cookie to help us keep track of your information on our systems. To anyone other than us, the information stored in your Cookies is meaningless. 

You might wonder if another Web site or online user would be able to steal your Passport login name from your cookie? The answer is no. Only Mercury Center or other Real Cities sites can read the information about your Passport Login Name. Due to the design of Web servers and browsers, no other Web site has access to your Mercury Center Cookie and vice versa. However, if you have chosen Automatic Login, anyone who sits down at your computer can log on to the site using your Passport information. 

Mercury Center may also collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.

**Does Mercury Center collect credit card information or other billing data?**   
Signing up for a Mercury Center Passport is free, as are most of the services that come with the Passport. In the future, we may add new features and services which will carry a charge. If you are interested in making use of these, you may be asked to supply credit card information or other billing data. In such case, Mercury Center will provide a secure means of transferring the sensitive data back and forth across the Internet.

**Can I get rid of my Real Cities Passport?**   
Yes. If you want us to disable your Passport or remove it from our records, you may notify us by sending email to [sjm_passport_feedback@realcities.com](mailto:sjm_passport_feedback@realcities.com). Please include your Passport Login Name. We will send you an email to confirm your request. When you have responded, we will remove your information from our database.

**What else should I know about my privacy?**   
Please remember that the protection of your privacy begins with you. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your Passport password, and you should always be careful and responsible whenever disclosing information online.
