**Privacy Policy**

_Website Visitors_

Like most website operators, meredosto.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Meredosto’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how meredosto.com visitors use its website. From time to time, meredosto.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

meredosto.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. meredosto.com does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

_Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information_

Certain visitors to meredosto.com websites choose to interact with meredosto.com in ways that require meredosto.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that meredosto.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and email address. In each case, meredosto.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with meredosto.com. meredosto.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. meredosto.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
