# MerchantWords | Privacy, Terms of Service

## MerchantWords Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how and when MerchantWords LLC (the "Company") collects, uses, and shares your information when you use MerchantWords, including our mobile applications and websites (the "Services"). MerchantWords receives your information through our mobile applications, websites, email notifications, and other interactions with our Services. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize MerchantWords to use your information in the United States and any other country where MerchantWords operates. 

Information Collection and Use 

We use your personal information to help us efficiently operate the Service, to contact you in connection with your transactions and other activities on the Service (including, but not limited to, confirmation emails or important news that could affect your relationship with the Company), and to forward messages to you from other Service users. These types of communications are known as "Operational Communications." In some cases, Operational Communications may also contain commercial messages, such as banner ads and special offers. By registering with the Company, you agree to receive Operational Communications. 

**Creating a MerchantWords Account and Profile Information:** When you create a MerchantWords account, you must provide access credentials in the form of an email address and password. You must also provide your credit card number. You may update or modify your profile information and contact information at any time. 

**Contact Information:** In addition to using your contact information to create your account, we may use this information to send you information about our Services, respond to your requests and facilitate your use of the Services. 

**Links:** We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, for example to provide relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on. 

**Cookies:** The Services employ "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. MerchantWords may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. If you do not want cookies from MerchantWords or other websites, you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies. 

**Third-Party Services:** MerchantWords uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services. These third-party service providers may use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of our Services and other websites and services, including your IP address, device ID, pages viewed, and links clicked. 

Information Sharing and Disclosure 

**Service Providers:** We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States and abroad. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. Our service providers include [Stripe](https://stripe.com/us/privacy). 

**Law and Harm:** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect MerchantWords's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's, including a government's, request to disclose your information. 

**Business Transfers** : In the event that MerchantWords is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. 

**Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:** We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did). 

Modifying Your Personal Information 

If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access or modify the profile information you provided to us and associated with your account. You can also permanently delete your MerchantWords account by contacting us. 

Our Policy Towards Children 

Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account. 

Children under 18 years of age are not authorized to use the services of MerchantWords without written permission from a parent or guardian. 

Changes to this Policy 

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at www.merchantwords.com/privacy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an email to the email address associated with your account or through the Services. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy. 

California Privacy Rights 

California law entitles residents to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal information we share with third parties or with corporate affiliates for those entities' direct marketing purposes. The Company does not provide any personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. If you want to request a notice or have any questions about our privacy practices, please contact us at contact@merchantwords.com.
