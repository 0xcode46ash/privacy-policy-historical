In the registration process you may be required to provide the following information: your age or birthday (for age screening and/or to better understand who our users are); your first and last names; your e-mail address; a password and other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your account.

Your user profile may include: a profile photo; one or more usernames; your gender; biographic details that you provide; links to your profiles on various social networking sites; and a Merchbar user ID number that is created by Merchbar and used to identify your profile.   
The Merchbar user ID number used to identify your account and profile will be public and will appear in the URL of your profile page, but will only permit access to information that is considered public or that you have designated as public in your settings.   
Your first and last names and profile picture are considered “public” on Merchbar websites and search engines may index this publicly available information. When we offer profiles, we may also offer functionality that allows you to opt-out of public indexing of your public profile information.   
2.2 Information We Receive or Collect When You Use the Service on a Mobile Device   
If you access the Service from your mobile telephone or other mobile device, including iPads and tablets, we collect mobile device identifiers, including MAC Address, and IP Address. We may create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number. We may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name or e-mail address. We may also collect geo-location information each time you access the Service from a mobile device unless you have disabled the geo-location feature in the device settings. 

2.3 Payment Information 

If you make a purchase in connection with the Service, we will collect the billing and financial information necessary to process your charges, which may include your postal and e-mail addresses.

We will also store the correspondence and any information contained within. 

2.5 SMS Notifications, Push Notifications & Local Notifications We receive and store the information you provide, including your telephone number, when you sign up to have SMS notifications sent directly to your mobile phone.

When you access our websites or the Service, we collect (i) certain technical information about your mobile device or computer system, including MAC Address, IP Address and mobile device ID; and (ii) usage statistics about your interactions with the Service. This information is typically collected through the use of server log files or web log files (“Log Files”), mobile device software development kits and tracking technologies like browser cookies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information. Some of the cookies the Service places on your computer are linked to your user ID number(s). For more information on how we utilize cookies and other tracking technologies please review the “Cookies and Automated Information Collection” portion of Section 3 (“How we Collect Information about You”). 

3\. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU 

We may collect information about you in any one or more of the following ways: 

3.1 Information about Users 

When you use the Service, Merchbar collects and stores certain information that you provide directly or through a third party website. We may also collect information about your interaction with other users of the Service. The bulk of this information is collected and stored through the use of Log Files, which are files on our web servers that record actions taken on our websites. 

3.2 Communications Features 

You may be able to take part in certain activities on our websites or by using the Service that give you the opportunity to communicate or share information not just with Merchbar, but also with other users of our Service. We may record and store archives of these communications on our servers to protect the safety and well being of our users and our rights and property in connection with the service. You acknowledge and consent to the recording and storage of such communications for these purposes. 

3.3 Cookies and Automated Information Collection 

When you access the Service, we collect certain technical information in order to (i) analyze the usage of our sites and services; (ii) provide a more personalized experience; and (iii) manage advertising. We and service providers acting on our behalf, such as Google Analytics, use Log Files and tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information, including cookies, IP addresses, device type, device identifiers, browser types, browser language, referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of activity on our websites, and other similar information. In some cases, we will associate this information with your user ID number for our internal use.   
We may also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to prevent fraud, remember your in-Service preferences and speed up load times.   
You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of the Service, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your activities within the Service. 

4\. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

9\. PRIVACY POLICIES OF LINKED SITES AND ADVERTISERS Our websites may contain advertisements from companies other than Merchbar that may link to their own websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. If you have any questions about how these other websites use your information, you should review their policies and contact them directly. 

10\. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION Merchbar implements reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information both online and offline, and we are committed to the protection of customer information. For user accounts registered with Merchbar, profile information is protected by the password each member uses to access their online account. It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your Merchbar account, the website allows you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password. When you sign into your account or enter payment information (such as a credit card number when purchasing virtual currency), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”). While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our websites and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorized access. 

11\. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY 

We may make P3P – compact machine-readable – policies and headers available. If we do so, we will try to ensure that they are consistent with this human readable policy. However, in the event of a conflict between a machine-readable policy and this policy, this (human readable) policy will control. If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you and other users by placing a notice on our website or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address we have on file for you. You should periodically check www.merchbar.com and this privacy page for updates.
