# Privacy Policy | Mercy Corps

We are committed to respecting the privacy rights of all donors and visitors to our website. The following information details Mercy Corps' collection, protection, and use of the data we receive from donors and visitors to this website.

**Our General Policy**

Mercy Corps recognizes the importance of protecting information we may collect from donors and visitors to our site. We maintain appropriate security measures to keep this information private. 

Users can visit the site without revealing any information about themselves. If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet for the purposes of correspondence, processing a donation or subscribing to our email newsletter, then it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information.

Mercy Corps will remove your name from our mailing list, email list or telephone solicitation list at any time, at your request. **We will not sell, rent or trade your email address to a third party.**

**Email Updates**

We use a third-party email marketing party to deliver emails. This company employs techniques for tracking open rates and click-thrus that use email address as an identifier.

You will be given the option to remove your name from our email list at the bottom of each email update. And, again, we will not sell, rent or trade your email address to a third party.

**Online Donations**

Our online donation processor hosts our secure giving pages on PCI Compliant servers and uses high-grade encryption and the industry-standard https security protocol to ensure secure transactions.

Independent external and internal audits ensure the privacy, security and appropriate processing of your information on our site.

**Use of Third-Party Software and Advertising Services**

Web browsers tell us the type of computer and operating system our site visitors are using. We're also able to learn the domain where our visitors come from. We analyze this data for trends and insights.

We also use [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/), [Quantcast](http://www.quantcast.com/) and [Clicktale](http://www.clicktale.com/) to examine data about our site visitors. These services tell us information about technical aspects of our visitors' computers and some demographic information. We use this information to improve our content and structure, leading to a better user experience. 

We do not receive or request any personally identifiable information from you unless you provide it.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)

**Spam filter**

To help us filter out spam we use a service called [Mollum](http://mollom.com/web-service-privacy-policy), a web service that tries to determine the quality of messages posted to a website, and particularly tries to determine whether these messages are to be considered as unsolicited messages. Mollom temporarily stores data you provide us when you add a comment -- which could include your message, name and IP address -- to perform complex statistical computations in order to assess the quality of your message (i.e., if it constitutes spam, abuse, etc.). You have the right to gain access to, correct and/or remove all personal data we store about you on Mollom's servers.

**Donations by Mail**

In order to increase our base of support and keep our costs low, Mercy Corps sometimes exchanges a segment of our mailing list with other carefully selected organizations. Donors who make their first gift to Mercy Corps in response to an appeal letter may be included on this exchange list; all other donors are automatically excluded from the exchange. All donors who made their first gift to Mercy Corps before January 31, 2004 are also excluded from the exchange. At least once a year, we will inform all donors who are eligible to be included on the exchange list, and give them an opportunity to opt out of future exchanges. Donors who wish to have their names removed from the exchange list can call 1-888-842-0842 or email [donorservices@mercycorps.org](mailto:donorservices@mercycorps.org).

**If you would have additional questions about our privacy policy, please feel free to contact us via email at[donorservices@mercycorps.org](mailto:donorservices@mercycorps.org) or 1-888-842-0842.**
