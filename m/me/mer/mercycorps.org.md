We use a third-party email marketing party to deliver emails. This company employs techniques for tracking open rates and click-thrus that use email address as an identifier.

You will be given the option to remove your name from our email list at the bottom of each email update. And, again, we will not sell, rent or trade your email address to a third party.

In order to increase our base of support and keep our costs low, Mercy Corps sometimes exchanges a segment of our mailing list with other carefully selected organizations.
