The Merchant Transact collects and stores information required to conduct business transactions requested by our users. By way of example, we collect product pricing and quantity information to process orders. We also collect information required to properly conduct communication between our customers. By way of example, we collect information from purchasers to properly direct business to the supplier(s) identified by the purchaser.

Merchant Transact automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address.

(Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.);

We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or

When Merchant Transact has reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who, intentionally or unintentionally, may be causing injury or harm to Merchant Transact users or other persons or violating the Terms and Conditions of use for this Web Site.
