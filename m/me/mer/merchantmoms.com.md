# Merchantmoms Privacy Policy

## How we use your data

In an effort to protect our clients' and site visitors privacy and rights, we have established a Privacy Policy which explains what information we gather on visitors and what we do with information that we gather.

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which we collect, use, maintain and disclose information collected from users of this Web site (each, a "User").

#### __Privacy

Users' privacy is very important to us. We are committed to safeguarding the information Users entrust to us.

#### __Data Collection

We collect personally identifiable information from Users through online forms for ordering products and services.

We may also collect information about how Users use our Web site, for example, by tracking the number of unique views received by the pages of the Web site or the domains from which Users originate. We use "cookies" to track how Users use our Web site.

#### __Data Usage

We may use personally identifiable information collected through our Web site to contact Users regarding products and services offered by us and our trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business partners, and otherwise to enhance Users' experience with us and such affiliates, independent contractors and business partners.

At no time will our database of users ever be sold to any entity for the purpose of marketing or mailing lists. Personal information will not be sold or otherwise transferred to our business partners without your prior consent, except that we will disclose the information we collect to third parties when, in our good faith judgment, we are obligated to do so under applicable laws.

We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone. 

We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization.

Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

#### __You Are In Control

You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by looking in your client area or contacting us via the email address or phone number given on our website:

-See what data we have about you, if any. 

\- Change/correct any data we have about you.

\- Have us delete any data we have about you. 

\- Express any concern you have about our use of your data.

#### __Security is Priority

We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.

Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. 

The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

#### __Updates

We may make updates to this Privacy Policy periodically without notification. Please refer to this policy when necessary to check for updates.
