We will only ever disclose personal information to other parties not listed above if we are required by law to do so.

**How we protect your personal information**

MGP safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic and managerial procedures. MGP requests that you take reasonable steps to safeguard and protect your own personal data when you are on the internet. Change passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers and make sure that you use a secure browser.

When you visit [www.mercedes-amg-f1.com](http://www.mercedes-amg-f1.com%3C/) ("Website"), you are able to do so anonymously. However, the web server may automatically record your IP address and the date and length of time you spent on our Website. We will only collect personal information that is volunteered by you.

**Links to other sites**

MGP will endeavour to only provide links to other sites that are from a trustworthy source. However, once you leave the Website, you should be aware and take note that we have no control over any other website. We cannot, therefore, be responsible for the protection of privacy of any information, that you provide on any other website. Those websites, will not be governed by this Policy. If you use any of the links provided to you from our site, you should read their applicable privacy statement.

When you visit the Website, these Buttons will be deactivated by default. To activate these Buttons you must click on them. Once they have been clicked they will remain active until they are deactivated by you or you delete your cookies. 

When the Button is activated, the social network can extract data independently, whether you interact with the Button or not. If you are logged on to a social network, the network can assign your visit to the Website to your user social network account. 

MGP has no control on the data retrieved by social networking websites and you must consult their relevant social network privacy policy, or data protection policy, to find out how they use your data. For the avoidance of doubt this Policy only relates to the Website.
