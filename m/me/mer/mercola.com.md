# Security/Privacy Policy

**Security**

> This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.
> 
> When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information, such as credit card number, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry, 128-bit SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.
> 
> While we use 128-bit SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.

**Ordering**

> We request information from the user on our secure order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. This information is only shared with other companies who work on behalf of Mercola.com to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.).

**Third Party Advertising**

> We do not accept any paid advertisements on Mercola.com. Any services or products recommended and/or offered in the newsletter or elsewhere on Mercola.com have gone through extensive review before such recommendations, and based on that review were recommended and/or offered. Mercola.com's powerful search capability is provided by Google, however, and so it should be noted that when Mercola.com visitors use this search functionality and see outside websites/products/services advertised in the search results, those are part of Google's program, not Mercola.com's.

**Log Files**

> Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Newsletter**

> Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instructions on our [unsubscribe page](https://web.archive.org/forms/unsubscribe.htm).

**Email-A-Friend**

> If a user elects to use our E-mail to a friend service for informing a someone about an article, we launch the default email program on the users computer. We do not know who you send the article to and therefore we could not collect and store that data.

**Notification of Changes**

> If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, they will not be contacted again nor will their personal information ever be used by us in any manner.

**Contact Information**

> If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/forms/contact.htm).
