# Security/Privacy Policy

**Mercola.com's Policy on Security and Privacy**

As a doctor I take patient privacy issues very seriously and these same philosophies extend to my website. I will explain my policies in detail below but let me state up front that in general I will do not believe in using any data for any reason without the persons permission in advance. In addition I take great care in protecting any information that is collected on this website against outside access.

**Security**

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information, such as credit card number, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry, 128-bit SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.

While we use 128-bit SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.

**Ordering**

We request information from the user on our secure order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. This information is only shared with other companies who work on behalf of Mercola.com to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.).

**Profile**

We do not use any information that we collect to create a profile of our users. 

**Cookies**

We do not use cookies on our site nor do we have any third party company placing cookies in your browser.

**Third Party Advertising**

We do not have any advertising on our website. We also try not have any advertising in our newsletters but we use a third party to provide this service so we have less control over what they add. If we notice any advertising in our newsletters, other than a link to the company provideing the service for us, then we will find an alternative as quickly as possible.

**Log Files**

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Clear Gifs** (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

We do not use clear gifs or web bugs.

**Newsletter**

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instructions on our [unsubscribe page](https://web.archive.org/forms/unsubscribe.htm).

**Email-A-Friend**

If a user elects to use our E-mail to a friend service for informing a someone about an article, we launch the default email program on the users computer. We do not know who you send the article to and therefore we could not collect and store that data.

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
