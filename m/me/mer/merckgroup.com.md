# Privacy Statement - The Merck Group

**General**

Thank you for your interest in the Merck KGaA Web site (referred to briefly as “Merck” in this letter). The issue of data protection and confidentiality is a topic we take very seriously by us, and we follow the applicable national and European data protection regulations. With this statement on data protection measures, we would therefore like to provide you with information on the kind of data which we – that is, Merck and its subsidiaries – may wish to save and how we use such data.

 

**Storage and use of data**

As a visitor to our Web site, you will remain anonymous. The data we save and analyze is used for statistical purposes only, for instance to ensure the continuous improvement of our services. The data we save to our servers comprises the name of your internet service provider, the Web site from which you have visited us, the Merck Web pages you have looked up, your IP address and the date and duration of your visit.

 

**Collection, processing and use of personal data**

We only collect and process personal data if you make use of specific services and if you have voluntarily given us your express consent. You may do so, for instance, as part of a registration procedure, by completing a form or by sending an e-mail, ordering products or services, sending us a query or requesting materials. Unless we are subject to other legal commitments, we only use your personal data for the purposes for which you have given your consent.

Your personal data will not be shared by us with third parties unless you have given your consent (e.g. permission for use by Merck subsidiaries) or unless we are instructed to do so by the authorities. If you have given permission for use by Merck subsidiaries, then these subsidiaries are obliged to treat your personal data as specified in this Data Protection Statement. The same commitment is given by Merck on behalf of other third parties, to ensure that they process your personal data as specified for their original recording purpose. This concerns, for instance, deliveries, analyses and technical services.

If data has been released for use by Merck subsidiaries and if such permission involves data transfer to other countries, Merck will ensure that the data importer is placed under a suitable level of data protection commitment.   


 

**Data storage**

We only store data for the period of time that is required to conduct the service you have requested.

 

**Right of access, correction and objection**

You are entitled to review and correct any of your personal data we have saved, and you may withdraw your consent to the use of your data at any time, affecting all future use. All you need to do is send a message by e-mail, telephone or letter to the Corporate Privacy Officer (postal and e-mail addresses see below).

 

**Data protection and security**

All our staff and all third parties involved in data processing are subject to commitments under the Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (German Data Protection Act) and are obliged to confidentiality in the use of personal data. Our data protection measures are continually updated, reflecting technical developments.

 

**Contact**

If you have any problems, questions or suggestions, please feel to contact our Corporate Privacy Officer.
