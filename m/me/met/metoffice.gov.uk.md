# Met Office: Privacy policy

The Met Office takes the privacy of its customers very seriously. Any personal information that you provide through this site will be dealt with in accordance with this policy. We also comply fully with the Data Protection Act 1998.  
  
What personal information do we collect?  
  
  
We will keep a record of the data provided by customers on registration, together with the details necessary to administer your account.

For customers, we may also keep a record of those parts of the service or parts of site you use most often, to enable us to monitor and improve our service and to know which parts of the service are of most interest to you. 

We may also keep track of pages visited by non-customers, in order to monitor which parts of the site are most popular.

How do we use your information?  
  
  
Registration details and customer information will be used to administer your account, to keep a record of which services you have subscribed to and to deliver the services you have requested. 

Except where you have opted out of such use, we may also use your information to send you information about the Met Office and other Met Office offers or services which we believe may be of interest to you. If at any time you wish to opt out of such use then you may contact our Data Protection Officer at the address below.

We do not sell or rent out personal information to any other organisations. 

Non-customers' site viewing information will be used to monitor and improve the layout of the site and the service we offer via these pages.

Who has access to your data?  
  
  
The Met Office is responsible for the processing of your data and is the 'data controller' for all information. Access to your data is limited solely to the Met Office and authorised employees. 

Our technology services provider, Wireless Information Network Ltd, or other contracted service providers, may also have access or store data for us, but solely for use on behalf of the Met Office in accordance with our instructions and under our control. Secure credit card and payment authorisation is handled by our payment provider. 

You may also access your registration details through the relevant customer administration page, using your customer password. Access is strictly controlled and password-protected.

The Met Office takes great care to ensure the security of this site and your personal information. Where credit card information is collected, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or equivalent secure technology. 

SSL is the industry standard method of encrypting personal information and credit card details so that they can be securely transferred over the internet. This means that you can purchase on-line with complete peace of mind. Further information is available on our security policy.
