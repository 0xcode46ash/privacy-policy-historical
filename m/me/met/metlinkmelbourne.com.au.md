# Privacy - Public Transport Victoria

Public Transport Victoria (PTV) will collect, use, store and disclose personal information and health information in accordance with Information Privacy Principles (IPPs) set out in the Information Privacy Act 2000 (Vic) and the Health Privacy Principles (HPPs) and the Health Records Act 2001 (Vic).

This policy outlines how PTV manages Personal Information and Health Information, and is designed to assist people to understand how Personal Information and Health Information is managed by PTV

Information is also provided about how people can seek assurance that their Personal Information and/or Health Information is maintained in accordance with the Information Privacy Act 2000 and the Health Records Act 2001.

This policy applies to all employees of PTV when dealing with Personal Information or Health Information. Where PTV enters into a contract with another organisation for the provision of goods or services relevant to the functions and powers of PTV, those organisations will be required to manage all Personal Information and Health Information in accordance with the Information Privacy Act 2000 and Health Records Act 2001 too, but may have their own relevant privacy policies.

This policy may be varied from time to time and will operate consistently, and in conjunction, with customised privacy policies and collection statements developed by individual business or work units within PTV to explain their particular privacy management practices.

## Types of Information

**Personal Information**

Personal information means information or opinion about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from that information or opinion. Some examples of Personal Information are your name, sex, date of birth, address, financial details, marital status, education and employment history. Some Personal Information is called Sensitive Information and is given extra protection under the law. This includes information about an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, political views, sexual preferences, membership of unions and criminal record.

In this policy, the term Personal Information will refer collectively to Personal Information and Sensitive Information, unless otherwise specified.

**Health Information**

Health information means information or an opinion that can be linked to an individual, whether living or deceased, that is about their physical, mental or psychological health, disability status; expressed wishes about the future provision of health services to him or her; a health service that has been provided, or will be provided.

**What is not Personal Information?**

Information contained in publications which are generally available is not Personal Information. Publications which are generally available include magazines, books, newspaper articles, annual reports and the Victorian Government Gazette.

## Collecting Information

PTV will only collect Personal Information or Health Information from an individual if it is necessary for the provision of services to that individual, or to carry out PTV’s functions. PTV will always take reasonable steps to collect Personal Information or Health Information directly from the individual the information concerns.

PTV’s principal functions are to plan, coordinate and provide public transport services across Victoria.

Some reasons that PTV may collect Personal Information or Health Information from a person are if they:

  * are employed by, or apply to be employed by PTV;
  * request to be placed on a mailing list maintained by PTV;
  * contact PTV directly, or contact the Victorian Government about a matter relevant to PTV’s function or services;
  * are provided with products or services by PTV; or
  * make a request for access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Vic);



**Collection statements / notices**

At or before the time PTV collects any Personal Information or Health Information from a person (or if that is not practicable, as soon as practicable afterwards), PTV will take reasonable steps to ensure that they are given a collection statement setting out the purpose for collecting the information, how the information will be used and the consequences, if any, for not providing the information requested.

Whenever it is lawful and practical, PTV will provide people with the option of not identifying themselves.

**Examples of information which may be collected, used, stored or disclosed by PTV**

#### Correspondence

Correspondence (including email) or complaints addressed to Victorian Government Ministers or agencies, or queries made through PTV’s call centre regarding matters related to the functions of, or service provided by PTV may be referred to PTV advice and response. Such correspondence, as well as correspondence addressed directly to PTV may include Personal Information or Health Information, and may be accessed by PTV staff, subject to operational need.

Copies of correspondence, applicable responses and details pertaining correspondence received by PTV which contains Personal Information or Health Information may be retained by PTV for certain periods of time, in accordance with the Public Records Act 1973 and other applicable legislation.

Some of this information may be disclosed to third parties, where legally required.

## Use and disclosure of information

PTV will only use or disclose Personal Information or Health Information for the purpose which was either specified or reasonably apparent at the time of collection unless the individual in question has consented to, or would reasonably expect that the information was put to another related use.

PTV will only use Sensitive Information or Health Information for another purpose if the secondary purpose directly relates to the primary purpose for which it was collected. In some circumstances PTV may be authorised by legislation to use or provide Personal Information or Health Information to another organisation for a particular reason. For example, PTV may not have to comply with IPPs when exercising responsibilities directly related to law enforcement or where the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) or CentreLink have requested the disclosure of your Personal Information or Health Information.

PTV will only transfer your Personal Information or Health Information to another individual or organisation in limited circumstances, including that the recipient is subject to a law which upholds similar principles to the IPPs or HPPs, or if the transfer is consented to.

PTV may also provide your Personal Information or Health Information to public transport operators and authorities for the purposes of providing feedback and answering queries. “public transport authorities” are: the Transport Ticketing Authority, Transport Safety Victoria and the Department of Transport.

PTV will also take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your Personal Information or Health Information if it is no longer needed for any purpose, unless, in the case of Personal Information, it is subject to the Public Records Act 1973, in which case it will be retained or disposed of in accordance with that legislation.

  * adopt, use or disclose a unique identifier assigned to any person by another organisation except in limited circumstances; or

## **myki **

The following information refers to privacy and myki. Most cardholders may choose whether they want to register their myki. Find out the benefits of [registering your myki](http://ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki/registering-your-myki/).

The full myki Privacy Policy can be found [here](http://ptv.vic.gov.au/assets/PDFs/myki-Privacy-Policy-May-2013-updated.pdf "Download the full myki Privacy Policy").

### **Personal information will be collected if you choose to do any of the following things:**

#### **Registering a myki**

Registration will require at least minimum contact details. For some concession cardholders, it is mandatory to register and personalise their card (with name, or name and photo), dependent on the category of concession entitlement. Registered cardholders can choose to personalise their myki with their name if this is requested at the time of purchase.

Personal information provided by or about the account holder or cardholder or generated by using the Card is collected by PTV to issue and administer the Card and relevant entitlements. The account holder or cardholder will generally be able to access his/her personal information. PTV requires personal information to provide the Card and related services, such as registration.

#### **Setting auto top up**

If you choose to register for auto top up (a direct debit facility from your credit card or bank account), PTV will need to hold relevant details required for payment processing.

#### **Topping up by credit or debit card**

If you choose to add value to your unregistered myki by using a credit or debit card, your credit card details are provided to PTV's bank and not retained by PTV.

#### **Ordering an unregistered myki via the PTV website or PTV call centre**

If you order an unregistered myki via the website or call centre, your contact details will be required temporarily to issue the myki. These details will be deleted about 30 days after the myki is mailed to you.

#### **Making a query or complaint**

PTV may require personal information (contact details) in order to respond to queries or complaints.

### **Use and disclosure**

Use of the myki will generate a record, which will include the location, time and date of the transaction. If a cardholder has provided personal details, PTV will have the ability to link these with cardholder's transactions. However, PTV or its agents will not normally need to do so in connection with the operation of the payment system.

Personal information held by PTV and public entities may be used or disclosed (including to each other) for the operation of myki; to verify entitlement to concession travel; for ticketing enforcement; in emergencies; otherwise as required or authorised by or under law; or with your consent. The full PTV Privacy Policy explains these circumstances.

### **Security**

PTV and its agents will take all reasonable measures to secure personal information.

### **Accessing or correcting your information**

To view or correct information that PTV holds about you, log into your account (if you have set up online access) to change your details directly or contact the call centre on **1800 800 007** 6am – midnight daily.
