# Privacy Policy - Metlink

### Respecting your privacy and the law

The privacy of your personal information has always been important to us at Metlink Victoria Pty Ltd ('Metlink'). We are committed to respecting your right to privacy and protecting your personal information. We are bound by the National Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth), the Information Privacy Principles in the Information Privacy Act (Vic), as well as other applicable laws and codes affecting your personal information. Our staff are trained to respect your privacy in accordance with our standards, policies and procedures. 

### About this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy outlines how we manage your personal information. It also describes generally the sorts of personal information held and for what purposes, and how that information is collected, held, used and disclosed. 

This Privacy Policy applies to all your dealings with us whether using the Website, in writing, in person or through our Call Centre. We encourage you to check our Websites regularly for any updates to our Privacy Policy. 

### Collecting your personal information

(a) Website 

It is intended that the Metlink Website can be used anonymously. However, for some functions of the Metlink Website the collection of personal information is necessary or unavoidable. You will know if Metlink is collecting personal information from you because you will be requested to provide it. The only exception to this is where someone else provides Metlink with your personal information. Metlink cannot prevent this. When you visit our Website, we may collect general information that will not personally identify you, such as: 

  * Internet browser
  * Operating system
  * Date of visit
  * Time of visit
  * Path taken through the site 



This information alone does not identify an individual and we will not combine it with information that does identify you as an individual. It provides statistics that we use to analyse and improve the Metlink Website. Through this statistical data, we are able to gain insights and a greater understanding of how people use our sites. 

Our website will use "cookies" to gather statistical information that helps us understand what you find interesting and useful on our Website. These cookies are known as your "Unique Visitor Cookie" and identify you only by random number (e.g. #12489). You can decline our cookies by adjusting the "accept cookies" setting on your browser, however this may affect the functionality of the Website on your browser. 

Our website contains embedded code. This gives us statistical site usage information about the pages visited, duration of page view, location previous to accessing the Metlink Website, the navigational habits of users, and browser and operating system. We do not use this code to collect any personally identifiable information. 

Metlink requests you to provide personal information only for the purposes of responding to your feedback, answering queries that you may have in respect of a particular site or the information you are trying to obtain, or to provide you with a subscription to “My Way”. 

(b) Concessions and Travel Passes 

Certain categories of people may be eligible for discounted or special travel passes for public transport. If you are eligible for any of these types of travel passes, it will be necessary for you to provide us with your personal information to enable us to issue a travel pass to you. The terms of these specific privacy requirements and obligations are set out in the "Travel Pass Privacy Policy" which is available from our website and office. 

(c) Call Centre 

When you phone our Call Centre, our operators may request that you provide your name, address, contact details or other personal information in order to identify you and to attend to your query or enquiry effectively. You do not have to provide us with this information, however failure to do so may mean that we are unable to assist you or respond to you in relation to your enquiry or complaint. 

### Use of your personal information

Metlink will only use your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or the Travel Pass Privacy Policy (if applicable to you). Metlink may also provide your personal information to the Victorian State Government's Department of Infrastructure, the Victorian Public Transport Ticketing Body (PTTB), its agents and contractors, other Victorian transport operators or Metlink's sub-contractors, solely for the purposes of issuing or renewing special travel passes and later a myki card, providing feedback and answering your queries, or to provide you with future updates about Metlink services or the new myki card. If you indicate that you do not wish to receive these updates we will not send them to you. 

It is our intention that this policy will protect your personal information from being dealt with in any way that is inconsistent with applicable privacy laws in Australia 

Metlink reserves the right to use or disclose any information as necessary to comply with any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of our Website or our services, to fulfill your requests or to cooperate with any law enforcement investigation or an investigation on a matter of public safety.
