MetroPCS understands that your privacy is important, and we have adopted this privacy policy to inform you of the steps we take to protect information about your use of our Service. In offering and providing Service to you, we collect certain information relating to your use of our Service, including information that identifies you, such as your name, address or credit card, as well as other information that you provide to us (“Personal Information”). Personal Information also includes information about you that is available to us solely by virtue of your customer relationship with us, such as information regarding your payment history with us, and other information relating to the quantity, type, technical configuration, destination, and amount of your use of the Service. In addition, Personal Information includes information provided to us by third parties, such as consumer reporting agencies and vendors, or that we collect from our interactions with you, for example when you visit our web page. 

We protect the privacy of your Personal Information in accordance with applicable federal law. 

For example, we may collect, use, and disclose your Personal Information for the following reasons:

  * to market or provide handsets, related equipment, or information services to you;
  * to provide services necessary to, or used in, the provision of Service, including the publishing of directories;
  * to protect our rights or property or to protect customers or other telecommunications carriers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, our Service;
  * to provide information regarding products or services, referrals, or administrative services to you when you contact us and approve of our use of the information during the course of the call;
  * to provide call location information about wireless subscribers in emergency situations; and

MetroPCS is constantly striving to enhance the quality and selection of the products and services that we offer to you as our customer. As a result, we also may share information, including Personal Information, about you with others such as retailers and direct marketers that we select in an effort to make you aware of additional products and services that may be of interest to you. 

You have the right to opt out of our use and sharing of Personal Information for these marketing purposes. If you choose to opt out of this use and disclosure of Personal Information, however, it will make it more difficult for us to offer you products and services tailored to your needs. You can direct us at any time: 

  * not to use Personal Information to inform you of MetroPCS product and service offers (other than those related to your Service, handsets, information services, or related equipment) that we believe would be of interest to you;
  * not to use Personal Information to inform you of product and service offers from third-parties that we believe would be of interest to you; and/or
  * not to provide Personal Information about you to non-affiliated third-parties for marketing purposes,



by writing to: MetroPCS, P.O. Box 601119, Dallas, Texas, 75360-1119. Your request to opt out of disclosure of such information will continue to apply until you notify us that you would like to revoke or limit it. Your decision to opt out will not affect our provision of Service to you. 

In addition, you can direct us to disclose Personal Information about you to any person by writing to: MetroPCS, P.O. Box 601119, Dallas, Texas 75360-1119. 

Personal Information, as defined above, does not include aggregate customer data (collective data about our customers from which customer names or other identifiers have been removed), and we may create and share reports containing aggregate data about our customers or otherwise use or share aggregate data about our customers. Personal Information also does not include your name, address and telephone number to the extent you have directed us to make such information available for directory service.
