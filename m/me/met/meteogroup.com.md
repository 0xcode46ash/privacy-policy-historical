If you have any requests concerning your personal information or any queries with regard to our processing please contact us by sending an e-mail or write to us at: The Data Protection Officer, Legal Department, PA Group, 292 Vauxhall Bridge Road, London SW1V 1AE.

Whenever you supply personal information to any MeteoGroup company we are obliged to deal with that information in a lawful way in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

We may request information from you in order to process your transaction, fulfil your order or provide you with the services and products you expect. This information may include, but is not limited to, details such as your name, your address, your e-mail address, telephone number and bank account details. If you subscribe to any MeteoGroup service or product we will use your personal information to provide you with the service or product you select (e.g. sending you password reminders or notices about the relevant service or product being suspended for emergency or routine maintenance). In addition, we may collect information from you, for example, in order to reply to any enquiry you make of any MeteoGroup company. We may use the information you provide for our own internal statistical purposes.
