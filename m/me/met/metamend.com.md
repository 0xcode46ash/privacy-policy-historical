Metamend is committed to protecting your privacy. Metamend uses information collected through our analytic tools to provide your SEO and SEM services. 

Metamend may, from time to time, use your contact information to inform you of changes in services, to provide you updates about the search engine industry, or to inform you of special offers of value. 

Metamend will not sell, trade or divulge any of your personal information to other entities including individuals and organizations.

Metamend is governed by the laws of the province of British Columbia. Metamendâ€™s information retention and storage policies conform to the strictest commercial privacy laws in the world as outlined in the [link] [Personal Information Protection Act (2003)](http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/P/03063_01.htm)

When ordering Metamend's services online, your privacy is protected through secure server practices as represented by the on-line industry. The secure server software encrypts all information you input before it is sent to Metamend. All of the data Metamend collects is protected against unauthorized and unlawful access.

Metamend values and upholds your personal privacy rights to its highest levels. Our privacy policy is therefore adopted with a commitment to safeguarding these rights:

## No Sharing of Information.

All information gathered is used by Metamend and Metamend staff only. Metamend does not sell or lease user information to any third party. Metamend does not share or cross reference personal information gathered through website usage with any other databases or third parties other than in two (2) exceptional cases: (1). When the site is legally compelled to do so; (2). Where disclosure is made at the request or with the written consent of the user. Therefore, unless required to do so as set forth above, we shall not respond to any inquiry from any third party unless we hold your written consent. If an inquiry is received without our having had your written consent to reply, we shall write to you requesting such consent. Our site makes no representations with respect to the creation of profiles or the use of cookies by external Web sites that have links from our site or that read and use information visible on our site.

## Gathering of Information.

Our IP address log is used to gather broad demographic information through analytics. Our site receives feedback from members primarily through email. This information is not shared with any third party except in the two (2) exceptional cases referred to above or unless you authorize us to do so. Our site's registration form requires you, the user, to give us contact information (like your name, telephone post and email addresses). We use that information to contact you when necessary. Financial information that may be collected via secure means is used only for billing purposes. Our site uses state-of-the-art technology to keep your personal information, including your account information, as secure as possible. Additionally, every Metamend employee must abide by our privacy policy. Employees who violate our privacy policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

## Use of Cookies.

As part of its personalized services, Metamend may use cookies to store and sometimes track information about a visitor to our website. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sites on Metamend that are customizable require that you accept cookies. Any information obtained from the cookies will be used solely to improve our services to you. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. 

## Security of Service.

We have state-of-the-art security systems that are protecting your account. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we do our utmost to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We recommend that you not divulge your account information to anyone and that you do not provide access to your data to any other third party.

We make every effort to maximize your privacy rights while you use this service. If you have any questions, concerns or comments, regarding our privacy policy or any other aspect of our service, please e-mail us at
