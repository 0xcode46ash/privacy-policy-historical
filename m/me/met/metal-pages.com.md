Subject to limited exceptions, the Data Protection Act 1998 gives you the right to access the personal information that we hold about you. If you wish to exercise this right, please write to us at the address above. We reserve the right to charge you a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with access to the information. We also reserve the right to require you to provide satisfactory evidence of your identity before we give you any access to personal information.

As noted in the introductory section above, the way in which we collect information from you or ask you to provide us with information will depend on the nature of your relationship with us. 

For example, if you visit our Websites, use our Apps or access Argus information pursuant to an agreement between Argus and you/your employer (“Licensed Materials”), we (or third parties on our behalf) may collect certain information using “DRM Tools”.

a) What are “DRM Tools”? 

DRM Tools are the products, services and processes that Argus uses to identify how you use our Websites, our Apps and/or the Licensed Materials. These DRM Tools allow us to collect, monitor, manage, analyse, record and store data about such use. For details of all of the DRM Tools we are currently using, [please contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/). 

b) How does Argus use “cookies” and what are they?

The DRM Tools that Argus uses include cookies. A “cookie” is a small piece of information sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information back from the browser. Cookies enable us to improve and personalise the Websites and Apps for you and to automatically collect information about how our Websites, our Apps and services are being used. For more information about cookies in general please visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

These cookies allow us to count page visits and traffic source, and analyse user browsing activity across our websites so that we can measure and improve the performance of our Websites and Apps.

We use services provided by Google Analytics and Marketo, Inc. The analytical cookies are non-intrusive, which is why they are already set when a user accesses our Websites and Apps. 

[www.metal-pages.com](http://www.metal-pages.com/) uses certain proprietary analytics cookies developed for that site. 

The information collected through these cookies includes:

  * the times and dates on which and the geographical location from which you access our Websites and/or the Apps; 
  * which pages you have visited; 
  * which products, services and resources you have used; and
  * information about the device you use to access our Websites and Apps, including your IP address, which internet browser you are using and your operating system.

RTP cookies

These cookies are used to record your last website visit and activity, and to deliver customised content and features based on your user choices and past browsing.  Session cookies expire after 30 minutes, while other cookies automatically expire after 24 months.  
  
When accessing our Websites and Apps you can set your browser to refuse the setting of all cookies, including essential cookies. However, selecting this setting may mean that certain areas of our Websites and Apps are inaccessible to you and/or may not work properly. If you do not set your browser to refuse cookies, a cookie will automatically be issued to you when you log on to our Websites and Apps.

c) Does Argus use any other tools that are similar to the cookies set out at paragraph b above?  
The DRM Tools that Argus uses include Bing Webmaster Tools and tools provided by third-parties that log server side events. The information collected using these tools is similar to that collected using Google Analytics and comprises: 

  * the times and dates on which and the geographical location from which you access the Websites and/or the Apps;
  * which pages you have visited;
  * which products, services and resources you have used; and
  * information about the device you use to access our Websites and Apps, including your IP address, which internet browser you are using and your operating system. 



The logging of server side events is integral to the functionality of certain parts of our Websites and Apps. It is, therefore, not possible to disable all of these tools by changing browser settings. If you do not agree to your information being collected in this way, please contact us (see above for contact details).

d) Google’s AdWords services  
We also use Google’s AdWords “conversion tracker” which uses a cookie to help us understand how people who click on our Google advertisements interact with our Websites; this tracking cookie is set on your browser when you click on a Google advertisement. AdWord’s cookies are time limited (and expire within 90 days). Please refer to the advertising policy on the Privacy & Terms section of Google’s site ([www.google.co.uk/policies/technologies/ads/](http://www.google.co.uk/policies/technologies/ads/)) for more information about conversion tracking and opting out.

e) Third party Remarketing services   
We use third party remarketing services. These service use cookies to help us deliver targeted online adverts based on past visits to our website. In relation specifically to Google Remarketing, please refer to the Advertising page of the Privacy & Terms section of Google’s website ([www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/)) for more information about opting out.

f) Social media   
We have accounts with certain social media services (for example Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google +, Youtube and Vimeo). Your use of those services is subject to their service terms and privacy policies. Where those services provide us with information about your interaction with us on their platform, our use of that information is governed by this Privacy Policy. 

 

We process the information we collect from time to time:

  * in order to perform our obligations, exercise or enforce our rights under our agreement(s) with your/your employer;
  * to offer you additional products and services provided by Argus, Argus group companies or Argus’ third-party partners; and
  * for any purpose connected with your/employer’s agreement(s) with us, including the maintenance of a central database of customers 



Specific examples include:

  * providing any products or services requested by you; 
  * telling you about changes to our services, our Websites, our Apps and their functionality; 
  * providing you with information about other products and services we offer (please see below for more information);
  * keeping you informed about industry developments; 
  * notifying you of industry conferences, events and training courses; 
  * handling customer orders and billing; 
  * administering our business activities; 
  * ensuring that our Websites and our Apps are presented in the best manner for you; and
  * providing customer service including enquiries and complaints. 



Argus will retain your information for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it is collected. 

If you do not wish your personal information to be used for marketing purposes, you will be able to exercise your right to prevent such use by ticking the appropriate boxes on the web form when you submit your personal information or by clicking on “unsubscribe” in the marketing communication that you receive from us. And of course you can withdraw any consent you have given to use of your personal information for marketing purposes at any time by contacting us using the details referred to above.

We are required to hold your personal information in accordance with the security provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998. Periodically, our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing the security/confidentiality of information.

As the transmission of data over the internet is not secure, we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted in this way. Any such transmission is at your own risk.

We may disclose your information to any of our group companies and branch offices, some of which are located outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).   
We may also disclose your personal information:

  * to third-party suppliers that we engage to provide services which involve processing data on our behalf;
  * to companies with which we have partnered in the provision of services to you;
  * to a buyer (or potential buyer) of the business or business assets;
  * if required to do so by a court, government entity, regulatory agency or any other competent authority or otherwise to comply with legal obligations, to protect our rights, safety or property or those of customers or others, or to enforce the terms of our agreements;
  * to your employer to provide information about your use of our Websites, our Apps and the Licensed Materials; and
  * for other purposes as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law or regulation. 



As we are an international company, personal information that we hold may be transferred to, stored and processed by our group companies, branch offices or suppliers which are located in countries outside of the EEA where the level of legal protection for your personal information may not be as comprehensive as in the EEA. By providing your personal information to us, you agree to such transfer, storage and processing. 

The effective date of the most recent Privacy Policy is noted at the end of this Privacy Policy. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on this page and any changes will be effective immediately upon posting so we recommend that you regularly check this page to understand how we use your personal information. 

Our Websites and our Apps may contain links to third-party sites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to third party sites. We do not accept responsibility or liability for the way in which such third-party sites collect and use personal information about you. You should ensure that you read any third-party privacy policies prior to submitting data to such sites.
