# MetroFax Internet Fax Privacy Policy

MetroFax does not share, disclose or sell any personally-identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number or email address) collected online on MetroFax sites with other unaffiliated companies or organizations for non-MetroFax marketing purposes. In the future, should MetroFax decide to share such data with third parties for marketing, it will provide notification and the opportunity for its users to indicate whether they would prefer that the Company not provide such information about them to third parties. Because this information is a critical part of our business, it would be treated like our other assets in the context of a merger, sale or other corporate reorganization or legal proceeding. MetroFax also does not market to, or knowingly collect personal information from, children under the age of 13 on Company sites.
