# Privacy Statement | Metropolis Magazine

Privacy Statement

Bellerophon Publications, Inc., is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

**Subscription**  
We request information from the user on our subscription order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. Our subscriber list is sometimes rented to direct-response mailers. If you would prefer that you only be contacted about _Metropolis_ -related billing and processing matters, please let us know by writing to us at _Metropolis_ , P.O. Box 609, Mt. Morris, Illinois 61054 or by calling us at (800) 344-3046.

**Conferences**  
We request information from the user on our conference registration form. A user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers and ad serving and reporting companies). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies of the information they collect.

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad anonymous demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Sharing**  
We will share anonymous aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We reserve the right to transfer all information to our successors in business in connection with a transfer of our stock or assets or a new joint venture.

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies enter into contracts with us which provide that they do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed under their contract with us to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

**Links**  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Metropolis is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**Talk2us**  
If a user elects to email information to our Talk2Us pages, we reserve the right to use this information on the site. We also reserve the right to edit this information for appropriate content, correct spelling and syntax, and for the sake of brevity. If the user's phone number, or email address is included, he may be contacted by an editor if that editor has questions regarding the content of his message. Otherwise, that user's information will be kept confidential. Any responses to his message will be funneled through MetropolisMag.com.

**Email to a Friend**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Metropolis will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Metropolis stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact us at [webmaster@metropolismag.com](mailto:webmaster@metropolismag.com) to request the removal of this information from their database. Otherwise the information may be retained for the purpose of improving or further personalizing the site.

**Email Registration**  
Our email registration form is strictly optional. During registration, users are asked to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide unique identifiers, but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.

**Security**  
This web site takes industry standard precautions to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'

We also take commercially reasonable measures to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
