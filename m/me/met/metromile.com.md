###  What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Get It? 

MetroMile collects a variety of information that will aid us in quoting and servicing your insurance policy and providing the Service to you. This information includes "nonpublic personal information", which is all information that identifies you and is not available to the public. 

We collect this information through your application information, your communications with us, your transactions, your consumer report and use of the Service. We also collect certain information that is linked with your account through a wireless enabled telematics device installed in your covered vehicle (the "Metronome"). 

Here are some examples of the information we get: 

  

  * **Application and Communications:** Through the App and the Service we gather information such as your name, address, residential information, phone number, drivers license number, social security number, gender, date of birth, educational background, former insurance information, vehicle information, marital status and driving history, as well as other information that you may provide through other communication features of the Service.
  * **Consumer Report:** Through consumer reporting agencies we gather information such as your driving record, claims history with other insurers, credit report and insurance score. These agencies keep your information and only disclose it to us as permitted by law. By submitting an application for coverage, you authorize MetroMile to request your credit report. You are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report directly from the consumer reporting agency we utilize.
