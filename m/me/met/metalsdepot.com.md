**Effective:** April 1, 2003 

**Our Commitment To Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

**The Information We Collect:**

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the MetalsDepot website or by phone. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are: 

    Name Address   

    Email address  

    Phone number  

    Credit/Debit Card Information   

    (etc.) 

**The Way We Use Information:**

We use your payment and contact information you provide when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order, for example, we use a credit card processing company to bill purchasers of goods and services from the Site.   
Depending upon the goods and services being ordered and where they are being shipped, we may also use outside suppliers and/or delivery companies to assist us in fulfilling and delivering orders. We share with them the information necessary to enable such order processing, fulfillment, and delivery of goods (i.e. - your name, address, phone number, etc). 

We may provide personal identifying and account information in special cases such as enforcement of our Terms of Site Use, or as required by law or legal process to protect and defend the rights and safety of our Site and its users. This includes exchanging information with other companies for purposes of fraud and credit risk reduction. 

_We do not share, rent or sell your personal contact information you provide us to outside parties other than those mentioned._

**Our Commitment To Data Security**

Strong precautions are taken to protect the information of the users of our Site. When users submit sensitive information via the Site, that Information is protected both online and off-line. 

We take credit card information security seriously and use a variety of technical solutions to make shopping safe at our Site. Furthermore, your information is encrypted and is protected utilizing the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption software, secured by VERISIGN®. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user- information off-line. All of the information of our Site's users, including the sensitive information mentioned above, is maintained in a restricted section in our offices. Only those of our employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our account or customer service representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, our employees are very aware and fully trained regarding the protection and privacy of your sensitive information. 

**Cookies**

You may have heard of the term "cookies". Most, if not all, E- commerce merchants, including MetalsDepot, routinely use cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's hard drive through the Web browser program containing information about the user which enables us to track and personalize the Site to enhance your experience. For instance, by setting a cookie on our Site, we can provide you with storage of items in your shopping cart between visits. However, if a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our Site although we will be unable to provide our users with the personalized shopping experience we can offer using the cookie data. 

**Consent**

By using our Site, the user agrees to the terms and conditions set forth in this Internet Privacy Statement and the Site Terms of Use INCLUDING ALL LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES PROVISIONS AND USE OF MATERIALS which are an integral part hereof and the user consents to the collection and use of this information by MetalsDepot as disclosed in this Internet Privacy Statement. We may revise this Internet Privacy Statement or the Site Terms of Use at any time by updating these postings. By using this Site you agree to be bound by any such revisions in effect at the time of use and should therefore periodically visit this page and the Site Terms of Use page to determine the then current policies applicable to users of the Site.
