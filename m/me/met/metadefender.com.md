By choosing to enter and submit the requested information when prompted, you are consenting to our collection, use, and disclosure of such information for the purposes of providing the services to you as outlined herein. Any information you post to a chat room or public bulletin is available to all users of that site.

We will use this information only for matters related to your order or product registration unless you request otherwise. Your credit card information will be maintained only for a period reasonably necessary to ensure payment has been received.

**Security of your personal information**  
We take the protection of the personal information you provide very seriously. Personal information collected is stored in servers with limited access. When passing information over the Internet through our service, information is protected through the use of encryption, specifically through the use of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. However, perfect security on the Internet does not yet exist and we cannot warrant that our transfer of data is impenetrable or invulnerable to hackers. We may hire certain outside contractors to perform services or functions on our behalf (such as customer support, packaging & shipping). We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to complete the desired service. They are not permitted to use customer information for any other purpose and are obligated to keep your customer information confidential. 

Information submitted to us may be transferred across national boundaries. We will only disclose information if required to do so by law or legal process.
