# Meteor - Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to Meteor. In the process of using the Meteor Reference Platform, presently available at http://www.meteor.com, (the "Service") some information about each user is collected. This information, as well as the information that you share by using the Service is private. This statement is provided to clarify our company's commitment to your privacy. 

**What information is collected?**

Our registration form requires users to give us contact and billing information such as name, street address, email address and credit card information. A user is also required to identify a Login ID and a Password. 

We record your IP address, as well as the time, date, and URL information of each HTTP request made to our servers. There may be occasions when we will ask for additional information. We do this to better understand your needs, and to provide you with services you may want. Any such additional information is also subject to this policy. This site has security measures in place to protect the disclosure, misuse or alteration of the information under our control. Specifically, your account information is password protected, so third parties do not have access to that personal information. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone, and that you sign out and close your browser window when you have finished using the Service. 

Users also have the option to voluntarily share feedback information such as telephone and fax numbers, city of residence and job title which may be used by us to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze site usage, improve service offerings, customize our site's content and layout to better understand and respond to customer needs. 

**Presentation Content**

Presentations, documents and other information that you share using the Service are stored on firewall-protected servers operated by Meteor. To view the content, you will need to enter your correct, speaker-defined, personalized Login ID and Password. 

**Web Travel**

In the course of using Service, we automatically track certain information about you. This information includes the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), the URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), and what browser you are using. 

**What are cookies and how are they used?**

As a way to provide personalized services, Meteor uses cookies to store information about your account. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer. This cookie will not contain your password or credit card information. The cookie we place on your computer is only there while you are logged into the Service and is removed as soon as you log off the Service or close your Web browser. 

Cookies are used to make the Service easier for you to use by saving your authentication information to facilitate the login procedure and service performance. The information in the cookie will not be used for marketing purposes or shared with third parties. If you configure your browser to reject cookies, you will be unable to use the Service. 

**How this information is used**

Meteor uses your contact and billing information for account maintenance and to communicate service updates to you. Your IP address is used to help identify you when you visit our web site. Your contact information will not be given to third parties unless you authorize us to do so. 

Meteor will not disclose or sell your personal information to any third parties, unless you specifically authorize us to do so. Meteor will not willfully disclose your individually identifiable information without your prior consent, unless ordered to do so by a court of law or other governmental authority. Meteor may, from time to time, release generic information regarding advertising impressions and traffic patterns in the form of aggregate reports to third parties. 

**Contacting us**

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, the practices of this website, or your dealings with this site, you can contact us at privacy@meteor.com. You may modify information previously provided to us, elect to opt-out of receiving the service or any communications from us or elect to remove information from our databases, by sending us an email at [privacy@meteor.com](mailto:privacy@meteor.com).
