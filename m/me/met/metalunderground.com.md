Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take advantage of future metalunderground.com features if you do so.

Additionally, in the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.

### Privacy of Children

A child's Profile Information will never be used for uses related to the site's service but not necessary to its operation (a "Secondary Use").
