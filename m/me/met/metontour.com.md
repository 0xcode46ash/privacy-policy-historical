# METALLICA.com | Privacy Policy

Metallica.com may use any information you submit to us about yourself during your visit in order to provide you with the ultimate web experience, while keeping you up to date with the latest information about Metallica and the site. Please note that your information is not shared with any other party, except as strictly necessary to process membership applications and merchandise orders, or as required by law. We understand your need to maintain your privacy when using the internet.

###### Information we collect and how we may use it:

We may collect both personally identifiable (name, email, address, credit card information) and non-personally identifiable (gender, zip code, country, age) information.

Personally identifiable information that we may collect may include credit card numbers, address and billing information, which will enable us to process and charge your credit card account for your fan club membership applications and/or merchandise orders.

If you sign up on the mailing list, enter contests, complete surveys, or use our forums, we may request your contact information (name, email address, date of birth, zip code, gender, country and language preference, etc.).

The mailing list is our newsletter that informs you of any events, upcoming shows, and important news. The contest information will be used to notify winners and be able to award prizes. We may use survey information that we gather to monitor and improve the website for our users.

The information collected in conjunction with any of our forums (chat, bulletin boards, etc.) may be used to provide you with the ultimate website experience. Please keep in mind that if you voluntarily disclose personal information in the public forums (bulletin boards or in the chat areas) on this web site, the information that you provide may be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from other people. You should NEVER disclose personal contact information (i.e. address, phone number, etc.) to strangers in public forums such as bulletin boards or chat rooms. You hereby accept all risks associated with any such disclosure and acknowledge that Metallica, metallica.com, metclub.com, its agents, administrators, representatives, employees, successors, assigns, and attorneys shall have no responsibility or liability as a result of any such disclosure.

Otherwise the only information that we may disclose to a third party vendor would be aggregate non-personal information, such as statistics and demographics. This may include demographic information (gender, general location, age, sales and traffic patterns), but this information is NEVER identifiable. We do not sell, trade, donate, or rent personal information...EVER!

###### Cookies

Cookies are non-personally identifiable information, small pieces of information stored by your browser on your hard drive. They are not programs and cannot be used to read any data or files on your computer and it is unlikely that a cookie will cause a virus. They are used to make viewing our website easier by saving your preferences and password, so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. Cookies also enable us to gather the amount of times a user has visited our website and the pages that are viewed. We do this in order to better our website. This gives us information as to what is interesting on our site and drives traffic to it and what doesn't.

If you wish not to accept cookies, simply choose the "disable your cookies" option on your web browser, as most web browsers are automatically set up to accept cookies. Please keep in mind that this will erase any personalized preferences you have set up and it may be difficult to complete transactions, such as purchasing merchandise, renewing or signing up.

###### Children's Privacy:

This website is in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and does not collect use, or disclose the personal information of a child under the age of 13. If a child under the age of 13 registers on our site, we will not accept the registration and the information will be deleted immediately. In the event that a child posts personal information in a public forum, such as boards or chat, we will attempt to delete that information once we become aware of it. You may contact [metbb@metclub.com](mailto:metbb@metclub.com) for any removal of such information.

###### Limits of Liabilities and Legal Process:

We may be forced to disclose personal information in response to legal matters or should the law require it. This would be an unlikely situation, but information could be requested due to a subpoena, court order, or law enforcement agency's request.
