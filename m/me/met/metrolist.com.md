# Metrolist, Inc.

**Effective: August 30, 2011**

At Metrolist, Inc, we are fully committed to the protection and security of any information you provide to us as our customers and as visitors to our website. We want you to know that we truly respect and will protect your privacy, so you can enjoy using our services which allow us to better serve your needs.

Our Privacy Policy discloses our approach to privacy and how your personal information is collected and used. Your use of our website constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and your consent to the practices it describes.

**What Information We Collect**

Generally speaking, our website is informational. Your "personally identifiable information", that is, information about you as an individual which would permit someone to contact you, is only requested by Metrolist in order for us to send you information such as our newsletter, to enable us to provide search functionality and to provide the various real estate professional management tools we offer to assist you in your business. We do not collect any personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it.

If you pay for Metrolist, Inc. services online you will be asked for, among other information, your credit card billing information, credit card number and credit card expiration date. This sensitive information is verified and processed via a secure connection using SSL (Secure Socket Layer), which is a protocol for transmitting private documents via the Internet. This financial information is only used for processing payments. However, we may use your billing information to contact you when necessary to fulfill your order.

As is the case when you visit most websites, to administer our site, your visit triggers the automatic logging of certain anonymous information about your computer system such as the type of browser you use, the server name and your "IP" (Internet Protocol) address. When your web browser or email application requests a web page or email from another computer using the Internet, it automatically gives that computer your computer's "address" so it knows where it should send the information. This is called your computer's "IP address." This anonymous information does not contain any personally identifiable information.

**Online Broker and Office Search**

The Metrolist PrimeAccess site includes a function that allows other PrimeAccess users to search for Brokers and real estate offices. Information from your PrimeAccess profile will be visible to other PrimeAccess users through this search function. If you would like to limit, or change, the information that is visible to others through this search function please log into your PrimeAccess account and change this information in your profile.

**How We Protect Your Information**

We also want you to know that we take the security of your information very seriously and that we take appropriate measures to protect the files in our data system.

You need to know, however, that due to the open communication nature of the Internet we cannot guarantee that communication between you and us, and between us and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties nor can we be responsible for information stolen from our servers by information harvesting software which may have the ability to scrape data.

**Links to Third Party Sites and Applications**

Metrolist uses third party sites, for example, to manage our user's feedback and to manage our Help Center. These sites may collect information about your interaction with the site. Please read the Terms and other policies posted on those sites, if applicable.

The Metrolist.com and PrimeAccess sites use third party applications, for example, in registering for training and education classes. These third party applications may collect information about your interaction with these applications. Your use of these third party applications is subject to their respective Terms and other policies, if applicable.

Metrolist also provides links to other third party sites. We are not responsible for the availability of any other site to which this site links. We do not take responsibility for the contents, advertising, products, privacy policies or other material made available through any other site nor do we endorse other sites. Please direct your concerns to that other site's webmaster or appropriate contact.

**How We Use Your Information**

When we ask you for information, we tell you, or it will be clear, why we need any personally identifying information from you either to fulfill a request from you or to provide information or services to you.

**We Do Not Sell Or Rent Your Personal Information**

Aside from our own use of your personal information, we do not share any personal information we may have about you with third parties for promotional use without your consent. Also, you control what marketing information you receive from us, by simply letting us know if you wish to opt out and not receive information from us.

We may, however, have to disclose, transfer, sell or assign your information obtained through this website, or otherwise in our possession, to a third party as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation of Metrolist. We may also have to make information obtained through this website, or otherwise in our possession, available to law enforcement personnel and agencies when requested to do so or as required by law.

**We Want To Provide Only Information You Want**

At any time, you may let us know whether or not you want to continue to receive information from us. If you do not wish to receive information from us, you can specify your preference by emailing us at [privacy@metrolist.com](mailto:privacy@metrolist.com).

**Cookie Technology**

Cookie technology is employed when you access our site. For our members it is part of the authentication process when you enter your User Name and Password. For our visitors it helps us keep track of the pages you visit while on our website. "Cookies" are small text files sent by Web servers to be stored on the computers of website users. These files often contain personalization settings or unique identifiers to keep track of your information and to help us understand the movements of users within and between websites. Cookies alone do not personally identify individuals. One may, however disallow receiving cookies at any time through the web browser settings. **Privacy Statement Changes**

We reserve the right to change or amend our Privacy Policy to address new issues of privacy and information security and to reflect changes to our website or business practices. Any new changes and/or amendments will be posted on this page. Each version of this policy may be identified by its effective date which is located at the top of the page.
