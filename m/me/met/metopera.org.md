_What Information About You Is Collected and How Is It Used?_

## **Anonymous Information**  

You can browse our sites without logging on, and no personal information about you or your visit will be collected. Some anonymous, statistical information is automatically logged when you access one of our sites. These “access logs” allow us to make our sites more useful to you and others who use them by, for example, tracking which features of the site are most used by visitors. None of this information, which is listed below, is associated with any personal information or contains anything identifying you personally:

  * The date of the visit
  * The time of arrival and length of visit
  * The browser used (e.g.,  Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.)
  * A list of files downloaded or pages viewed
  * The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the machine through which the site was accessed
  * Any errors encountered



## **“Cookies”**

A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier that is automatically stored on the hard drive of a computer that accesses a website. It allows our systems to recognize your browser’s access privileges and to personalize your session with us. We do not share information from cookies with any third parties. If you do not wish a cookie to be placed on your computer, however, you can adjust the settings on your browser accordingly, although doing so will limit the range of features that will be available for your use on our site. (For example, you must have cookies turned on to place items in your shopping cart.)

Tracking Tags (also known as “web beacons,” “action tags” or “single-pixel gifs”).  Our websites may also use tracking tags.  Tracking tags are invisible graphics embedded in the pages of our websites that are programmed to collect non-personal information about your use of our website.  Like cookies, tracking tags provide overall usage patterns for our websites that we use for analysis and to provide personalized services and advertising content. 

## **Personal Information**  

When a customer using our websites requests brochures, enters quizzes, uses performance/season selection tools, or purchases a membership, tickets, merchandise, Met Opera on Demand trial, subscription, or rental, or other items, we must have the information necessary to process the transaction: name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and, when applicable, credit card number. For reasons of security, no credit card information is shared with any third parties or stored permanently on our web server. If a user registers at our sites, but does not make a request or purchase, this same information, is collected with the exception of credit card information. In addition to using your name and contact information to fulfill your requests, process your transactions or to award prizes, your name and contact information will be added to our database, and we may perform statistical analyses of user behavior to measure interest in the various areas of our sites. You may receive direct mail or telemarketing calls from the Met. We sometimes make names and addresses available to select organizations for direct mail marketing purposes.

On occasion, the Met shares information collected from our customers with selected third-party companies that assist the Met in advertising and marketing efforts. For example, we may retain an outside company to help us with customer research, to manage a customer database, or to send e-mail messages. The information we provide to third parties may include your name, address, e-mail address, site usage, and purchase information, which will help us target marketing communications.

We may release information if we are required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that it is necessary to comply with the law or legal process served on us or protect and defend our legitimate business interests, rights or property or rights of our customers and patrons.

If you communicate with us by letter, e-mail, phone or in person, it is possible that information about the communication may be collected into a file specifically about you.
