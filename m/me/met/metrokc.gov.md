Privacy

| 

King County adheres to the highest of Internet standards, protecting its users' privacy, observing and championing Net etiquette, linking externally without endorsements, and aiming for factual information throughout. To that end, here's a look at what we expect from users of our site and what users can expect from us.

**Terms of us** **e**  
By visiting the King County Web site, users agree that they will not use the site for any unlawful activity, or use it in any way that would violate the following terms and conditions.

This Web site is governed and construed by the laws of the State of Washington. Any use of the Web site shall comply with all King County, Washington and State of Washington laws and regulations as well as with all federal laws and regulations. Any lawsuit or claim arising from this Web site shall be brought in the King County Superior Court, Seattle, Washington.

**Linkage**

King County links to external Web sites in the hope that users will find reference material on county-related subjects. Because King County cannot control those sites, it cannot be held responsible for content included in them. Moreover, in no way should an external link be considered any form of endorsement by King County.

**Use of communication forums**

The King County Web site has or will contain threaded discussions, chat rooms, and other communication forums. By participating in any of these, users agree to send and receive messages that are both proper and related to the forum topic. The following actions are prohibited:

  * Defaming, harassing, threatening or otherwise violating the legal rights of others, including their privacy (see below);
  * Misrepresenting one's person, background, or character;
  * Posting any defamatory, infringing, obscene, false, or unlawful material;
  * Selling, advertising, or exchanging any goods or services unless expressly allowed;
  * Posting any copyrighted material owned by a third party.



Also, you agree to use any King County forum at your own risk. While championing proper use of such forums, King County cannot guarantee that violations of the above code will not occur.

**Privacy**  


**Preface**

King County, as a government entity, conducts public business and its records related to the business of King County are generally available for public review. Nevertheless, King County is committed, to the extent allowable by law, to protect and secure your personal information contained in King County records. This privacy commitment must be balanced with the rights of public access under Chapter [ 42.17 RCW](http://www.leg.wa.gov/rcw/index.cfm?fuseaction=chapterdigest&chapter=42.17) (external link, Washington Public Disclosure Act) consistent with [ KCC 2.14.030](http://www.metrokc.gov/mkcc/code/05-Title%202.pdf) (549K PDF; scroll down to 2.14.030) and any other applicable federal, state, and local statute or regulation.

This privacy notice does not apply to personnel files, job applications, court records, law enforcement investigation, regulatory investigation, assessor records, and recorded documents maintained by the Records, Elections, and Licensing Services division.

**Information privacy**

King County gathers personal information when it is relevant and necessary to accomplish county business. We only obtain this information through legal means. When King County collects personal information from you, we:

  * Tell you why we are collecting this personal information;
  * Limit the amount of your personal information that we collect to that which is necessary for the stated purpose;
  * Take reasonable steps to use your personal information to the stated purpose;
  * Take steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete and current;
  * Provide your personal information only to authorized King County employees and private contractors or public organizations on a need-to-know basis;
  * Do not sell or make your personal information available to others without your consent except when legally required, needed to complete your transaction with the county, or in an extreme emergency that presents a threat of serious injury or loss of life;
  * Retain personal information only as long as necessary to conduct county business or only to the extent required by law;
  * Dispose of personal information in a secure manner that prevents disclosure;
  * Take organizational, technological, and physical measures to securely safeguard personal information.



**Information privacy specific to the Internet**

We also collect information on our Web site, both anonymous and personal.

  * Anonymous information cannot be linked to a specific person, such as user hits, visits and sessions that we track by Internet service provider. We use this information to help us create a better overall experience for our Web site users.
  * Cookies are another example of anonymous information that we use. Web site cookies are small text files that are placed on a user's computer by a Web server. We occasionally use cookies to tailor information to the needs of a user's specific browser. Our Web server is unable to determine any data about you nor does it do anything with these cookies.
  * Personal information collected on certain King County Web pages is data that you provide to us about yourself. Providing information to us on our Web site is purely voluntary. This information is used to better serve you. Should you choose not to provide information to King County on the Internet, you may provide this information to us in another way, such as visiting a county office during normal business hours or, for some county services, completing your business by mail or telephone.
  * When King County collects personal information from children using the Internet, it complies with the federal [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act](http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm) (external link).
