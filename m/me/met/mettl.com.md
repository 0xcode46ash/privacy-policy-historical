# Privacy Policy - Mettl.com

We collect two kinds of information from you: non-personal information and personal information.

Personal information is information we collect through this Web Site that we can use to specifically identify you, and may include your:

  * name, telephone number, social security number and e-mail address
  * credit card or similar information
  * past employment history
  * information you provide in online tests, including responses to test questions



You have the right to request the modification or deletion of any personal information retained by Mettl that is inaccurate, except that information relating to your test scores and performance, as set forth below. You understand that Mettl, in its sole discretion, will determine whether personal information should be modified or deleted.

We collect personal information from you through the Web Site only when you voluntarily share it with us, such as when you fill out a registration form, an online survey, or send us an e-mail; if you choose to purchase a product or apply for a job with us or our clients; or when you use one of our online forms.

**Non-personal information** is information we collect through this Web Site that does not identify you by name or as an individual person. It may include information like:

  * the type of web browser software your computer uses;
  * pages your computer visited and date and time your computer accessed our pages;
  * personal information that has been de-identified; and
  * the IP (internet protocol) address associated with your computer.



Cookies: We collect non-personal information from your computer’s web browser. A cookie is an information file that the Web Site places on your computer for record keeping and site navigation purposes. The cookie placed on your computer by the Web Site does not store your name, e-mail address or any other personal information about you. Your browser software can be set to reject cookies, including the cookie from our Web Site. However, please note that if you reject our cookies, you will not be able to use this Web Site.

We do not restrict the ways that we use or disclose non-personal information. We will use non-personal information from you to help us make this Web Site more useful to users and for other business purposes

  * to develop records, including records of your personal information;
  * for analytical purposes and to research, develop and improve programs, products, services and content;
  * To remove your personal identifiers (your name, e-mail address, social security number, etc). In this case, you would no longer be identified as a single unique individual. Once we have de-identified information, it is non-personal information and we may use and treat it like other non-personal information;
  * contact you regarding any problems or questions we have relating to your use of the Web Site, or, in our discretion, notify you of changes to our Privacy Statement, Terms of Use or other policy or terms that affect you or your use of the Web Site;

Unless otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Statement or at the time you provide your information, Mettl will only share your personal information with third parties under the following limited circumstances:

  * We may share the personal information you provide with the organization to which you are applying for a job, and with any of its suppliers who are involved in the application process.
  * We may also share your personal information with our parent, subsidiary, or affiliated companies (Related Companies) for our or their internal business purposes; but we do not share this information for their independent marketing purposes. 
  * In the ordinary course of business, we also will share some personal information with companies that we hire to perform services or functions on our behalf.
