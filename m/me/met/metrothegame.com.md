# Uberplay Entertainment Privacy Policy

Uberplay Entertainment is committed to honoring the privacy of our members and visitors. This privacy policy covers personally identifiable information shared through the Uberplay.com Web site

**What information does Uberplay Entertainment receive and how do we use it?**  
If you register as an Uberplay.com member or for various Uberplay newsletters or services, we ask you for your name, contact information, preferences, and certain demographic information. This information lets us provide personalized services and communicate separately with you. We also use aggregated information about the use of our services to evaluate our users' preferences, improve our programming, and facilitate third-party reporting of Internet usage. Finally, like most Web sites, we may use small bits of data called "cookies" stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection. Cookies let us "remember" information about your preferences and allow you to move within our Service without reintroducing yourself. Most browsers let you easily see and control cookies. 

**Can I choose what information I disclose?**  
While we need certain information to register you as a unique user and let you access personalized services, other requested information is optional and may be given at your discretion.

**What if I need to review or change the personal information I previously disclosed?**  
We encourage registered users to update and edit their personal information and keep it current. You can easily correct or update your personal information at any time after signing in.  


**What kind of security is used to protect my information?**  
We store all user information in secure databases protected via a variety of access controls. This data is accessed only for the purposes specified in this privacy statement.

**Who has access to my information?**  
We do not share personally identifiable data with other companies unless you specifically tell us we can do so.

**What about children's information?**  
Children under 13 may not sign up for any Uberplay Entertainment communication or services that require disclosing personally identifiable information. Please see our information on the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

**Children's Online Privacy Protection Act**  
Because of COPPA, you must be at least 13 years old to register for the Uberplay Entertainment Newsletters

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed by the U.S. Congress in November 1998. COPPA requires that operators of online services or Web sites obtain parental consent prior to the collection, use, disclosure, or display of the personal information of children. The Federal Trade Commission established rules for the act's implementation, which went into effect April 21, 2000.

Because of COPPA, we have chosen not to collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. Because members must provide personal information to be identified as an author, you must be at least 13 to register for the Uberplay Entertainment Newsletters.

If you are under 13, we invite you to browse our site anonymously as much as you like, then come back and register on your 13th birthday!

COPPA provides parents with specific rights regarding their children's privacy. For additional information and resources on COPPA visit the links below.
