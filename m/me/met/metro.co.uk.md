## Cookies

In order to fund our websites we run advertising on them. To make our advertising more relevant and effective, we use a range of technologies provided by third parties; many of which use ‘cookies’.

When you use the Site, we may collect information by using cookies. If you do not agree to our use of cookies on your device in accordance with this Privacy & Cookies Policy, do not use the Site unless you have disabled them.

If you’d like to learn how to manage these cookies and opt in and out of different types, please see our [Privacy & Cookies Policy FAQ](http://metro.co.uk/privacypolicyfaq).

**What are cookies?**

Cookies are small bits of text that are downloaded to your computer or other device (for example, your mobile phone) when you visit a website. Your browser sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit the site again, so it can recognise your device next time you visit and tailor what you see on the screen.

**How do cookies work?**

Cookies gather information such as the types of pages visited, and keywords searched in order to build an overall picture of interests or preferences based on browsing habits. This information is anonymous and is not linked to any information that can be used to identify you.  We also collect information relating to a user’s country, region and connection type gathered from elements of the IP of the browsing device. We do this to make our online advertising more efficient for our advertisers and promotions more relevant to you.

With permission from our advertisers, we also collect information about their sites, for use on their advertising campaigns. This is often called retargeting, or remarketing, and involves showing ads to groups of users that have, for example, visited that client’s homepage.

We also gather information on the users that reach an action page on an advertiser’s site. This allows us to monitor how many sales or actions we achieve for a client, and therefore how effective our advertising is.

Using cookies also allows us to gain useful information to improve our services, for example to know how many advertisements we serve, how many times these are clicked, how many advertisements are shown to a given user and how many customer actions these generate.

As well as our licensed ad servers, ads are also often served from third-party ad servers, such as those of media agencies, which all use cookies to track the same metrics as ours do.

We may share anonymous cookie data with third parties outside the DMGT group (for example, where data is grouped to show market trends) but we will not share your personally identifiable information to such third parties without your permission.

**What cookies do we use?**

Cookies are an important part of the internet. They make using websites much smoother and affect lots of the useful features of websites. There are many different uses for cookies, but they fall into four main groups:

**(i) Cookies that are needed to provide the service you have asked for (Essential Cookies)**

Some cookies are essential so you can move around the website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you’ve asked for can’t be provided. These cookies don’t gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you’ve been on the internet.

Here are some examples of how essential cookies are used:

  * met javscrmetrolife
  * Some are session cookies which make it possible to navigate through the website smoothly.



**(ii) Improving your browsing experience (Performance Cookies)**

These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make, such as your language or region and they provide improved features.

Here are a few examples of just some of the ways that cookies are used to improve your experience on our websites:

  * Remembering your preferences and settings, including marketing preferences.
  * Remembering if you’ve filled in a survey, so you’re not asked to do it again.
  * Remembering if you’ve been to the site before. If you are a first-time user, you might see different content to a regular user.
  * Restricting the number of times you’re shown a particular advertisement. This is sometimes called ‘frequency capping’.
  * Showing you information that’s relevant to products of ours that you have.
  * Enabling social media components, like Facebook or Twitter.
  * Showing ‘related article’ links that are relevant to the page you’re looking at.
  * Remembering a location you’ve entered such as weather forecasts.



**(iii) Analytics (Functionality Cookies)**

We like to keep track of what pages and links are popular and which ones don’t get used so much to help us keep our sites relevant and up to date. It’s also very useful to be able to identify trends of how people navigate (find their way through) our sites and if they get ‘error messages’ from web pages.

This group of cookies often called ‘analytics cookies’ are used to gather this information. We can then see the overall patterns of usage of the website rather than any one person’s activity. Analytics cookies only record activity on the site you are on and they are only used to improve how a website works., This information is anonymous and is not linked to any information that can be used to identify you.

Some of our websites and some of the emails you might get from us also contain small invisible images known as ‘web beacons’ or ‘tracking pixels’. These are used to count the number of times the page or email has been viewed and allows us to measure the effectiveness of its marketing and emails.

We also use ‘affiliate’ cookies. Some of our web pages will contain promotional links to other companies’ sites. If you follow one of these links and then register with or buy something from that other site, a cookie is sometimes used to tell that other site that you came from one of our sites. That other site may then pay us a small amount for the successful referral. This works using a cookie. Learn how to manage your [analytics cookies](http://metro.co.uk/cookiesoptout).

**(iv) Showing advertising that is relevant to your interests (Targeting Cookies)**

We sell space on some of our sites to advertisers. The resulting adverts often contain cookies. The advertiser may use the browsing information collected from these cookies to:

  1. restrict the number of times you see the same ad (frequency capping); and
  2. help show other ads that are relevant to you while you’re on our websites. This is often called interest based advertising or online behavioural advertising (OBA). Interest based advertising is a way of using information about your web-browsing activity, collected by using cookies, to group you with other users into interest groups and show you advertisements based on those interests. The data collected from cookies you get when you’re on our sites is only used to show relevant ads on our sites, not on other websites.



Sometimes our websites contain ads for our own products. These ads use cookies in the same way as described above.

So how does interest based advertising work? Let’s look at an example. Imagine you visit a website about travel. That website shows an advert and with that advert you receive a cookie. Imagine you then visit one of our websites which has an advert from the same advertiser you saw on the travel site. The advertiser will give you a new version of the cookie you received on the travel site. The advertiser can then use that cookie to recognise that you’ve previously been to a travel site and show you a relevant ad.

It’s easy to control interest based advertising and manage your cookies if you want to. For more information, see our [controlling interest based advertising](http://metro.co.uk/cookiesoptout) and other third party cookies page or visit or our [Privacy & Cookies Policy FAQ](http://metro.co.uk/privacypolicyfaq).

## Recommended content

When you navigate through metro.co.uk, you may see a list of recommended posts. We try to make the posts in the list as relevant to you as we can.

## How it works

When you read a post in metro.co.uk, information relating to the post is saved into your browser’s local storage (unlike cookies this local storage data is never transmitted). The data is then used by your browser to fetch more similar posts from metro.co.uk.

If you do not want this feature please disable local storage. The article link<http://webdevwonders.com/clear-dom-storage/> explains how to do this.

## Ad verification technology

In order to protect our advertisers’ brands, we often use a technology that scans the page to ascertain that it is safe from profane, sensitive & potentially brand-negative topics, before serving an ad there. This process is called Ad Verification, and these technologies use cookies to count ads served, those blocked, clicked and engaged by a user (i.e. they have hovered over them with their cursor).

For more information about cookies, please see our [Privacy & Cookies Policy FAQ](http://metro.co.uk/privacypolicyfaq).

## Safeguards and Security

No data transmission over the internet can be entirely secure, so we do not guarantee the security of your personal information and/or use of the Site. However, we use reasonable endeavours to protect the security of your personal information from unauthorised access or use by using encryption technology. In addition to these safeguards, your personal information is protected in the UK by the Data Protection Act 1998. This provides that the information which we hold about you should be processed fairly and lawfully, should be accurate, relevant and not excessive, not be retained for longer than is necessary and, if applicable, be kept up to date. For more information on the Data Protection Act 1998 and your related rights please see [www.ico.gov.uk](http://www.ico.gov.uk/).
