We collect and use the information you provide to personalize the Websites so that we can better meet your needs, fulfill your online order, facilitate customer service, and inform you of the Museum's products and promotional offers.

**Cookies and Pixel Tags**

The Websites use technologies such as "cookies" and "pixel tags" to improve the functioning of our website and your experience. Cookies are small data files that are automatically sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies enable us to remember what items are in your shopping cart, and to personalize your experience. "Pixel tags" are tiny graphical images embedded in emails or webpages. Pixel tags are used to determine what parts of a website a visitor has viewed, or whether an email was successfully opened. These technologies do not contain any personal information about you; they are used to gather information to analyze traffic to the Websites, to improve our content and navigation, to enhance our marketing efforts, to personalize your experience, and to provide online display advertising tailored to your interests based on your online behavior. To opt out of this advertising provided by The Met Store, visit [here](http://dtmc.metmuseum.org/adinfo/adchoices_fpc.html?cid=2118&cname=Met%20Museum&cmagic=92bbd3&clogo=met_museum.png).

The Museum also works with third-party marketing partners who use technologies such as cookies and pixel tags on our behalf. For details, see Third-Party Service Providers.

You may choose to set your browser so that it does not accept cookies. Most areas of the Websites will function without cookies, but cookies are required if you wish to register, sign in, or place items in your shopping bag. For an optimal experience with our site, we recommend that you allow cookies.

**When You Register**

You may use the Websites without registering or submitting any personal information. However, registration in MyMet enables you to maintain your contact information and sign up for exclusive online features such as MyMet, My Membership, free email newsletters, and a press account for accredited media. Registration in The Met Store provides access to features such as your order history and address book.

If you choose to register in any of these areas of the Websites, you will be asked to provide personal information that may include a username and password, your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and your Membership number, if applicable. We store this information, along with your other preferences, on a secure server so that you need not re-enter it when you return to the Websites. When registering in MyMet, if you select "Stay logged in," your information will be displayed automatically the next time you return to MyMet. You may review or change your account information in MyMet or The Met Store at any time.

**Third-Party Service Providers**

The Museum engages reputable third-party vendors in order to help us manage the Websites, process transactions, better respond to the needs of our visitors, and enhance our marketing efforts. This includes third-party marketing partners who serve advertisements across the Internet and sometimes on the Websites on the Museum's behalf. They may use information about your visits to the Websites and other sites to personalize advertisements for goods and services. The Museum may also share your personal information—including your name, address, email address, as well as a record of any transactions you conduct with us on our website or offline—with a third-party advertising partner and its service providers in order to deliver to you advertisements tailored to your interests on certain websites. Our advertising partner will make the data we provide anonymous. Although this website does not respond to a browser's "Do Not Track" signal, you may opt-out of interest-based advertising. To learn more about the use of this information and about advertising tailored to your interests by third parties, or to opt out, visit the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

The Museum requires its vendors to maintain the confidentiality of the information to which they are provided access, and restricts these vendors from using or disclosing the information in any way without express authorization by the Museum.

**Data Security**

The Museum makes every reasonable effort to ensure the security of transactions that occur on the Websites. To maintain data accuracy, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative procedures in place to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
