#### When You Register 

You may use www.metmuseum.org without registering or submitting any personally identifiable information. However, registration in My Met Museum enables you to maintain your contact information and sign up for exclusive online features such as My Met Calendar, My Met Gallery, and free email newsletters. Registration in Concerts & Lectures enables you to store your contact information, preferences, and interests to make purchasing tickets faster, and to receive notifications about events that interest you. Registration in The Met Store provides access to features such as your order history and address book.

If you choose to register in any of these areas of the site, you will be asked to provide personally identifiable information that may include a user name and password, your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and your Membership number, if applicable. We store this information, along with your other preferences, on a secure server so that you need not re-enter it when you return to the website. When registering in My Met Museum, if you select "Remember My Log-in," your information will be displayed automatically the next time you return to My Met Museum. You may review or change your account information in My Met Museum, Concerts & Lectures, or The Met Store at any time.

When you make an online purchase or request a catalogue from The Met Store, we may share the information you provide, such as your name and your postal address, with other reputable organizations and companies whose products and services might interest you. Please note that the privacy policies of these organizations and companies may differ from ours.
