**How We Use the Information You Provide**

We use the information you provide to personalize the Museum's website so that we can better meet your needs, fulfill your online order, facilitate customer service, and inform you of the Museum's products and promotional offers. Our use of visitor information varies with the type of visit or transaction. For details about each transaction type, see When You Register, When You Make a Donation, Purchase a Membership, or Purchase Tickets to an Event, When You Shop in The Met Store, or When You Complete a Survey.

**When You Register**

You may use www.metmuseum.org without registering or submitting any personally identifiable information. However, registration in MyMet enables you to maintain your contact information and sign up for exclusive online features such as MyMet, My Membership, free email newsletters, and a press account for accredited media. Registration in The Met Store provides access to features such as your order history and address book.

If you choose to register in any of these areas of the site, you will be asked to provide personally identifiable information that may include a username and password, your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and your Membership number, if applicable. We store this information, along with your other preferences, on a secure server so that you need not re-enter it when you return to the website. When registering in MyMet, if you select "Stay logged in," your information will be displayed automatically the next time you return to MyMet. You may review or change your account information in MyMet or The Met Store at any time.

**When You Make a Donation,  Purchase a Membership, or Purchase Tickets to an Event**

The Museum will ask you to provide personally identifiable information necessary to process and service your donation or Membership or ticket purchase online, which may include your name, billing and shipping addresses, telephone number, email address, and credit card number. Your credit card information will be temporarily stored on a secure server and used only for processing your online transaction. We will retain the personally identifiable information you provided for our records, and to facilitate customer service. The Museum never shares the personally identifiable information you provide when making a donation or purchasing a Membership or tickets online, through the mail, in person, or by telephone with third parties for marketing purposes, except as required by law. 

In certain cases, you may be asked for additional information required to complete and service your request, such as the names of your children when joining The Met Family Circle. (See Children Under Thirteen Years of Age.)

**When You Shop in The Met Store**

The Met Store will ask you to provide personally identifiable information necessary to fulfill your online order or catalogue request, which may include your name, billing and shipping addresses, telephone number, and credit card number. This is the same information requested when you place an order by telephone or through the mail. For online orders or catalogue requests, we also require your email address so that you can receive order and shipping confirmation emails, and so that we can communicate with you if we have difficulty processing your order or request. When you make a purchase, your credit card information will be stored temporarily on a secure server, and we will retain the personally identifiable information you provided with your order for our records, to facilitate customer service, and to inform you of our products and promotional offers. If you are a registered customer at The Met Store, your credit card information will be saved for the next time you shop with us, or you may select "Please do not save my payment details" on the Order Review page to opt out of this feature.

When you make an online purchase or request a catalogue from The Met Store, we may share the information you provide, such as your name and your postal address, with other reputable organizations and companies whose products and services might interest you. Please note that the privacy policies of these organizations and companies may differ from ours. If you prefer not to have your personally identifiable information shared in this way, please uncheck the box labeled "On occasion, I would like to receive information from companies carefully screened by The Met Store whose products and services may be of interest to me" that appears on the Billing Address page of The Met Store shopping registration process. You may also email us at [customer.service@metmuseum.org](mailto:customer.service@metmuseum.org) to request that we not share your personally identifiable information with third parties for marketing purposes. 

As part of our commitment to your privacy, The Met Store supports and adheres to the guidelines and practices of the Direct Marketing Association's Commitment to Consumer Choice.
