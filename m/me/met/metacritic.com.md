# Metacritic.com Privacy Policy

THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT WAS LAST UPDATED ON **9 DECEMBER 2004.**

METACRITIC.COM has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. Please note that in the rare circumstances where we do collect personal and demographic information about you, we do so by ASKING you to provide the information. In addition, we NEVER provide your confidential information to third parties, and we NEVER send you any emails unless you specifically request them. 

The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site.

### This Policy Statement

This statement officially communicates the privacy policy of Metacritic.com. You can always access this policy through a link on the Metacritic.com homepage or at the bottom of any page on the site. Any changes to the policy will always be indicated on this page; please refer to the top of this page for the date it was last updated. 

### Information Automatically Logged 

Our web servers record information about your web browser and IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information (to allow us, for example, to obtain a country-by-country breakdown of site visitors). 

### Third Party Advertising

We use multiple third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (NOT including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp).

### Cookies

Cookies are NEVER used to TAKE private information from your computer. Instead, they are used to temporarily store a very small piece of information on your computer to facilite your use of our website. In the future, this will enable us to provide personalized content for you on our site. For any password-protected areas of our site (there are none at the moment, but there may be in the future), we use cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. Furthermore, in the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser.

### Registration Forms 

Currently, Metacritic does not require or provide for site registration. A very brief form must now be completed to submit votes and comments for movies, games, music and books, and to use the "email this page to a friend" service. The information from the email form is not stored. The email address from the voting form is recorded only to prevent duplicate votes; the addresses are NEVER shared with third parties. Your email address is used to mail periodic newsletter(s) about our site, **but only if you specifically request to receive those newsletters**. If you do choose to receive newsletters, you may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

Note that periodically, when clicking on a "Read Full Review" link, you may be taken to a different website (that of the publication which published the full review) that requires registration. Metacritic is not responsible for the content or information gathering practices of these external websites, and we recommend that you read those sites' own privacy policies.

### Surveys

From time to time, our site may contain periodic surveys about various topics. Our online surveys may ask visitors for contact information (like email address), and demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). 

The information collected from these surveys is used to collect broad demographic information about our users and is never provided to third parties on an individual basis. Aggregate data may be shared with advertisers or other parties.

### Contests

In the future, it is likely that our site will provide various contests. These contests may ask visitors for contact information (like email address), and demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). 

Contact information from the registration forms is used to collect broad demographic information about our users and is never provided to third parties on an individual basis. Aggregate data may be shared with advertisers or other parties. Your email address is used to mail periodic newsletter(s) about our site, but only if you specifically request to receive those newsletters. If you do choose to receive newsletters, you may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.
