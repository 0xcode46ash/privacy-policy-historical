  7. We use cookies to identify visitors of this website and to keep track of browsing patterns and build up a demographic profile. Please note that visitors will always be tracked **anonymously** and the data is used strictly to improve the usability of the website. There is one exception, which is the Vero cookie that is only used to track Users that identify themselves by email by logging into our system. We use the following cookies: 
    1. **Google Analytics**

With Google Analytics we track non-personally identifiable data, including pages that are visited, for how long, what browser is used and from which pages Users exit. This will give us a better understanding about how our website is used and serves as input to improve the website and its specific pages. All of this data is anonymous. 

      * _Data collected_ : visits, page views, time on site, country, city, language, source, OS, browser.
      * _Data duration_ : as long as the site is being tracked with Google Analytics.
      * _Data owner_ : MessageBird
      * 3rd party cookie
Don't want your visit data reported by any website who uses Google Analytics? Learn about the [opt-out browser plugin](https://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=181881&hl=en). 
    2. **Optimizely**

Optimizely allows us to run A/B tests on our website. This offers us a simple way to test website changes against the current design and determine which version works better for the User. In order to do so, Optimizely identifies users and track their actions, but non of the data collected identifies you as a person. 

      * _Data collected_ : visits, page views, browser, source type and last 10 events triggered on site.
      * _Data duration_ : as long as the site is being tracked with Optimizely.
      * _Data owner_ : MessageBird
      * Both a 1st and a 3rd party cookie
If you would like to disable being tracked for A/B tests run by Optimizely, you can opt out via [this link](https://www.optimizely.com/opt_out). 
    3. **Crazy Egg**

Crazy Egg enables us to get an understanding of how visitors engage with the website through heat maps and scroll map reports. Crazy Egg only sets one cookie value in order to track whether a visitor is new or returning, so no personally identifiable data is collected. 

      * _Data collected_ : wether users are new or returning.
      * _Data duration_ : as long as the site is being tracked with Crazy Egg.
      * _Data owner_ : MessageBird
      * 3rd party cookie
Because Crazy Egg doesn't track users, they can't provide a simple opt out link. However, there are ways to [disable Crazy Egg from communicating with your browser](https://www.crazyegg.com/opt-out). 
  8. Users have the right to see what personal data is being held about them. To obtain a copy of the personal information, Users can write us at MessageBird attn. Communications Department, Baarsjesweg 285, 1058 AE Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Please note that MessageBird reserves the right to charge a fee of up to £10 for any such request. 
  9. Given that the Internet is a global environment, using it to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. This means for instance that data Users pass to us may be processed outside the European Economic Area, although the data will always be held securely and in line with the requirements of Dutch data protection legislation. By communicating electronically with us, Users acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal data in this way. 
  10. Please note that this privacy policy is subject to change from time to time. It was last updated on December 10, 2015.
