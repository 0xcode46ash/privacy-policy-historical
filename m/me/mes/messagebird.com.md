# We are serious about privacy - MessageBird

#### Introduction

We care about your privacy as much as we care about our own. MessageBird collects and processes personal information from everyone who visits our publicly available website, communicates with us, creates an account, and uses our products and services. In this page, we will explain how, why we do so, and what you can do about it.

Please carefully review this policy before you submit any information on or through our platform. By visiting this website and by using any part of the MessageBird services and products, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure and sharing of your and end users information as further outlined below.

#### MessageBird

MessageBird is a telecom software company disrupting the industry with its innovative SMS, Chat and Voice API solutions.

Our customers are generally companies that integrate our services in their business operations through their own software applications. Others use our website interface. We do not directly interact with our customers’ end users as the information that companies submit is shared with us on their sole discretion in accordance with our General Terms and Conditions (“Terms”).

#### What We Collect and How We Use It

We will only use your data for the purposes described below and only to achieve those purposes. For example, if you send queries through the “Talk to Sales” webform, we will only use this information to reply to your questions and know how to get back to you to provide you with the answer.

**While you browse our website,** you can directly interact with us by filling in different web forms. You can [‘Talk to Sales’](https://web.archive.org/en/contact-sales) or ‘Talk to Support’ through our Intercom live chat (in the bottom right corner of any of our web pages). You can also share your information by sending us an email or by subscribing to our newsletter. If you do any of the described actions, we will collect the information that you are asked to provide such as your name, email address, and the content of your inquiries. When you reach out for assistance, we gather data from your account related to how you’re using our platform, your business needs, some contact details and so on, to tailor our assistance and provide the best possible response to your inquiry. You can decide to sign up to our newsletters. If you choose to, we will ask for some personal information, such as your email address and your name.

**When you create a free trial account,** you’ll share some personal information: your name and email address as well as your username and password of choice. You can also sign up through your Google or Github account. By doing so, you allow third parties to share your email address and basic profile information. When you sign up, you will have to authenticate yourself by activating your account via a link sent to you through the email address you provided. You will then need to log-in with the username and password you previously created. We will thus use your basic information to identify you and make sure that you are a human being.

To try our SMS API you will need to share your number to text it. This way, you will be given the option to use our free trial credits, before deciding to upgrade your account.

We might ask for your telephone number in other circumstances too. We may ask you for it so that our sales team can contact you or If you decide to set up a two-factor authentication for your account. To enhance your security, you will need to enter your digits to which we will communicate verification codes to verify that it is you logging into your account. Furthermore, that number can also be used as a voice caller id.

**When you buy credits or subscribe to a plan,** we need more information. This includes your company details, billing addresses and preferred payment method(s). You will also be assigned an Account ID, which we’ll use to process your orders, assign invoices, and track API requests. If you integrate our APIs into your software application, you will be given an authentication token which allows us to identify you when you send the requests.

We keep a record of your account credentials, so when you instruct our APIs using your details, we know that it is you assigning the commands. Moreover, this way we can identify you when you talk to your account manager or our support team. We may also use it to improve our own internal processes and services or training our team members.

Some services might require additional information on the basis of the applicable laws. For instance, if you want to operate in Canada, Denmark, Malaysia, or the United States, you will need specific approval. You can do this on your account portal. To do so, we require details like the purpose of your campaign, and a template or an example of an SMS that you would send via MessageBird. To complete this procedure, we will share this information to local authorities.
