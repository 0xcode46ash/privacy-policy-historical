# Privacy Policy

**Version 1.0, Effective October 1, 2005**

Thank you for visiting the MessageLabs website and reviewing our Privacy Statement.

Personal information collected by MessageLabs on its own behalf is protected pursuant to the U.S. Privacy Act of 1974, the EU Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995, the United Kingdom Data Protection Act and the U.S. Department of Commerce "Safe Harbour" framework. 

Personal information that we process on behalf of our clients may or may not be subject to the above and other privacy regulations depending on the jurisdiction and the business of our clients.

**1\. Scope**

1.1 This Privacy Statement outlines how MessageLabs and its clients comply with privacy regulations in relation to the email security services offered by MessageLabs.

**2\. Background and definitions**

2.1 Clients contract with MessageLabs to deliver email security services. MessageLabs is a data processor which processes email on behalf of its client who is the data controller.

2.2 The term data controller is defined in US Safe Harbour and EU privacy legislation as the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. The data controller retains full responsibility for the data vis-à-vis the individual(s) concerned.

2.3 The term data processor means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.

2.4 The U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 uses similar principles and the terms "covered entities" and "business associate" instead of data controller and data processor. Similarly the U.S. Financial Modernization Act of 1999, also known as the "Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act" uses the terms "financial institution" and "service provider".

2.5. All legislation referred to here requires that the relationship between a data controller and a data processor is covered by a contract before outsourcing related to the processing of personal data takes place. The purpose of the contract is to protect the interests of the data controller, i.e. the person or body who determines the purposes and means of processing, who retains full responsibility for the data vis-à-vis the individuals concerned. The contract thus specifies the processing to be carried out and any measures necessary to ensure that the data are kept secure. 

2.6 MessageLabs only delivers its email security services to clients under a contract which defines the privacy obligations of its clients and MessageLabs.
