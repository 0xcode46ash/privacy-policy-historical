# Privacy Policy - Mesosphere

Privacy Policy (Effective: January 2017)

**By using or accessing the** **Website in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways. **

This Privacy Policy covers the use of information collected through our Website. Our treatment of information or data from your use of any Mesosphere products other than the Website (for example, Mesosphere Enterprise DC/OS) is subject to a separate agreement between you and Mesosphere.

Remember that your use of Mesosphere’s Website is at all times subject to the [Terms of Use (mesosphere.com/terms)][1], which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any capitalized terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the [Terms of Use (mesosphere.com/terms)][1].

### What does this Privacy Policy cover*?

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our services, including to to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Website. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.

As noted in the [Terms of Use (mesosphere.com/terms)][1], we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at contact@mesosphere.com.

#### Will Mesosphere ever change this Privacy Policy*?**

We’re constantly trying to improve our Website, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services, by sending you an email, by posting a notice on this Website, or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Website, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Website after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.

#### What Information does Mesosphere Collect*?

#### Information You Provide to Us:

We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the “Contact Us” process, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, phone number, and email address. Certain information may be required to sign up for the “Contact Us” feature or to take advantage of other features.

We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about Mesosphere products and services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link in those communications and following the instructions.

#### Information Collected Automatically

Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Website, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Website are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. If you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Website, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.

We may use it to improve the Website — for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Website, and we can use that knowledge to make the Website interesting to as many users as possible.

#### Will Mesosphere Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives*?

We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:

#### Information that’s no longer personally identifiable.

We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Website, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual.

#### Affiliated Businesses:

In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Mesosphere products or services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.

#### Our Agents:

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

#### Business Transfers:

We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred or subject to routine due diligence activities. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.

#### Protection of Mesosphere and Others:

We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our [Terms of Use (mesosphere.com/terms)][1] and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Mesosphere, our employees, our users, or others.

We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.

Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83–1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal information, which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to: _contact@mesosphere.com_.

We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.

You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to request contact with us or to take advantage of some of the Website’s features.

#### What if I have questions about this policy?

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to contact@mesosphere.com, and we will try to resolve your concerns.
