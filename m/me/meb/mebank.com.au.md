# Privacy Policy - ME Bank

**How to contact us** ^

Management and staff are aware of the need, and are trained, to exercise the utmost discretion in handling information obtained from customers in the provision of our services.

We appreciate that the protection of our customers' information, which has been provided in the course of business, is of the utmost importance to our customers and to us, as is the need to base our relationship on mutual trust.

When you register as a user of our website, we will validate your details, such as your name, address and age. Some of this information is essential for us to be able to accurately identify who is using our services and as such is mandatory. Other types of information are collected to help us profile who is using the services and what their interests are, and is of assistance to us for marketing purposes. Information of this type is often optional - you need only fill it in if you wish to do so. We value your trust and your information will be held in strictest confidence. The personal information that you provide to us during registration is used for identification purposes.

We, like you, are concerned about security. For information on this important issue, refer to our [Internet Banking security information page](https://web.archive.org/internet_banking/security.html) .

Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information over the Internet (for example: in discussion forums, via e-mail, or in chat sites) that this information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information in publicly accessible online forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your Customer ID and Access Code and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are using the Internet and our website.

If you have any concerns or questions, please call 1300 654 998 for the cost of a local call anywhere in Australia.

We will apply our privacy compliance procedures (which are based on privacy legislation and the Federal Privacy Commissioner's National Principles for the Fair Handling of Personal Information), in relation to any personal information which we gather in the course of carrying on our business. We regard all the personal information we have collected from and about you as being equally sensitive and undertake to treat it all in accordance with the principles set out in this Privacy Policy.

## Collection of Information

#### We will:

  * only collect personal information which is relevant to and necessary for a legitimate function or activity of our business;
  * only collect information by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive way;
  * tell you what, in broad outline, we intend to do with your personal information, including -   

    * whether we intend to disclose the information to any outside party and if so, the classes of persons or organisations to which it would be disclosed;
    * if there is any relevant law that either requires or allows the collection of that particular information; and
    * the main consequences for you if the information is not supplied;
  * where it is reasonable and practicable to do so, collect personal information directly from you, but, if we have to collect information about you from someone else, we will, wherever possible, obtain your consent where the information is not already in the public domain;
  * ensure that only permitted and accurate information is included in your credit information file, if any;
  * only request or collect a tax file number for the purpose of carrying out responsibilities under taxation law; not collect sensitive information about you unless:   

    * you have consented;
    * it is required or authorised by or under law; or
    * it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal or equitable claim.

    * the use or disclosure is required or specifically authorised by law; or
    * we reasonably believe that an offence has been, or is about to be committed and we use or disclose the personal information as a necessary part of the investigation of the matter or in reporting our concerns to the relevant authorities.

Any third party to whom such information is disclosed will be contractually obliged to protect the privacy of all information provided to them by us or which is obtained from any other source, or which they might collect in carrying out the task required;

  * notify you if credit is not granted, in accordance with specific requirements of privacy legislation;

## Access

#### We will:

  * deal promptly with your requests for access and amendment of your personal information;
  * ensure that access by your agent (if any) is limited to information allowed to be disclosed by your written agreement;
  * where we hold personal information about you that can readily be retrieved and you ask us to show it to you, provide you with access to the information unless denial of such access is specifically authorised or required by law (eg. legal professional privilege), or the provision of such access would:   

    * endanger the safety or physical or mental health of any person; or
    * have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of any other person(s), including our employees; or
    * require us to disclose any material which we have developed or derived from the personal information which has been collected, and which we may use in deciding whether or not we will enter into any business or other transaction or relationship with you. (Subject to the terms of this policy, however, we will give you access to the underlying information on which the decision is based); or
    * prejudice an investigation of possible fraudulent or other illegal activity;
    * where we have collected personal information about you from another person, only allow you access to that information with their consent;
    * if appropriate, levy a reasonable charge for providing access to personal information. Generally the charge would be based on the time taken to make the records available. Simply making a request for access will not give rise to any charge;
    * if we hold personal information about you and you can show us that the information is incorrect or misleading, take steps to correct that information. If we disagree with your opinion as to the information's correctness we will allow you to attach a statement to the information setting out your views;
    * when we refuse to allow you access to personal information about you, or to correct information which you believe is incorrect, tell you why.



## Identifiers

We will not adopt as our own identifier an identifier that has been assigned to an individual by a government agency such as a Tax File Number (or by an agent of or contractor to a government agency acting in its capacity as agent or contractor).

## Anonymity

While the nature of financial services does not easily lend itself to anonymity, we will wherever practical, and subject to any legal constraints, allow you to transact business with us anonymously should you so wish.

## Sending Information Overseas

We will not send your personal information outside Australia unless we are satisfied that the recipient of the information has adequate data protection arrangements in place, or you have consented to the transfer of the information.
