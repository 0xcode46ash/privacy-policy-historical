**Privacy Policy**

* * *

Because we at MilePoint respect our members and understand that you are concerned about privacy, we have instituted policies and procedures intended to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. We also post this privacy policy so that our members know what kind of information we collect, how it is handled and with whom it may be shared. 

The purpose MilePoint gathers member information is to verify each member's Sponsor account information, including Sponsor mile and/or point balances, to improve the content on our Web site, to enhance your on-line shopping experience, and for marketing and promotional purposes. At this point, such information includes member information gathered in the course of the registration of each MilePoint member. Some of the information gathered may be shared in the aggregate with corporate affiliates of MilePoint, as well as other responsible organizations that offer products or services that we believe may enhance the experience of our MilePoint members. 

MilePoint does not sell individual member names or other private profile information to third parties and have no intention of doing so in the future. MilePoint may share general member information with our partners only for specific and pertinent promotional use but only if our members have opted to receive such information. 

As we continue to develop our Web site and take advantage of technologies to improve the services we provide, this policy likely will change.
