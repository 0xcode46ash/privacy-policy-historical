As well, you may choose to visit _milepoint_ anonymously by just lurking. 

**WHAT DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION FOR?**  
Broadly speaking, any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways: 

  * To process transactions such as if you were to upgrade your membership level: your information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose of delivering the membership level requested.

**HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?**  
We implement a variety of physical, electronic, and administrative security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or access your personal information. 

We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. 

After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, mailing address, phone number, etc.) will be kept on file for more than 60 days in order to expedite and improve future visits and transactions that may occur on our site. 

**HOW DO WE SECURE YOUR INFORMATION?**   
We secure your personal information submitted by you by using reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, or accidental loss or destruction of the information. Your postings on _milepoint_ and other communications you may have with us via email or regular mail may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures are in place prior to your sending information. So, if you choose to communicate with us through these means, you are assuming the risk of doing so and we request that you do not send or post sensitive information through these means. If you want to safeguard the information exchange, feel free to give us a call at (719) 597-8889. 

**DO WE USE COOKIES?**  
Yes, _milepoint_ utilizes standard technologies called “cookies” and "log files" to collect information about how milepoint is used. Cookies are very small text files saved to your computer used to track your navigation around _milepoint_. These cookies are used to track which forum posts remain unread, and whether you are a current member of milepoint and your membership level of service on _milepoint_. This cookie is not identifiable other than by the website server, and does not store any information which could disclose personal information about you. Log files are merely a record of this information. Other information gathered may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at _milepoint_ , the websites visited just before and just after _milepoint_ , what type of web browser (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc.) you are using, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. Information is collected on an aggregate basis without any association to your personal information so that you remain anonymous. If you do not wish to transmit “cookie” information about yourself, you may turn off the cookie function in your web browser; please consult the “Help” section of your personal browser to correctly do so. 

**DO WE DISCLOSE ANY INFORMATION TO ADVERTISERS OR OUTSIDE PARTIES?**  
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to advertisers or outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site, so long as these outside parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce milepoint policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses — the key words here are ‘non-personally identifiable.’ 

**THIRD PARTY LINKS**  
We may include or offer third party products or services on our site. These third party websites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of _milepoint_ and welcome any feedback about these other websites. 

**ANYTHING ELSE?**  
There may be times when we may ask you to provide relevant data regarding your preferences and demographics information to answer survey questions. As in other instances, we will use this information in a non-personally identifiable manner. 

**ONE ADDITIONAL NOTE**  
When creating a member profile, you can enter as much or as little biographical information as you like. This type of private information is completely managed by you and may be edited or withdrawn at anytime, but please be aware that once made public, search engines might store the data indefinitely. 

**WHAT ABOUT MY EMAIL ADDRESS?**
