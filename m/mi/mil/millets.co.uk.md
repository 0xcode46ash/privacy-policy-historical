Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalised experience at our Website if we cannot recognise you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist. If you do choose to register with us then you will be able to choose whether you wish cookies to be turned on or off.

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognise your browser and to provide features such as personalised greetings and storage of items in your Shopping Basket between visits. These cookies will enable us to improve our knowledge of your use of our web site and to identify whether or not all of the pages which you request are successfully received. Whilst these cookies are anonymous, they do allow us to improve our Website. The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether.

## Security

At Millets, we realise how important it is to securely store any information that you provide us. Our site (millets.co.uk) currently uses high-level Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, the most advanced security software currently available for online transactions. You can therefore rest assured that we take the security of your payment and personal details very seriously. We may vary this in the future if we feel you will benefit from greater security whilst using our Website.

You can tell whether a webpage is secure as 'https' will replace the 'http' at the front of the www.millets.co.uk in your browser address window, also a small locked padlock will appear in the bottom bar of your browser window.

While we currently use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect your information off-line. All of your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer services representative) are granted access to your personal information. The servers on which we store your personal information are kept in a secure environment.  


## Verified by Visa and Mastercard® SecureCode™

To give you even more confidence in shopping online with millets.co.uk, we have introduced Verified by Visa and Mastercard® SecureCode™. These services enhance your existing credit/debit card accounts against unauthorized use when you shop with us. To use this service, you must first register with the bank or other organisation that issued your card.

[ Visit the Verified by Visa website](http://www.visaeu.com/iusevisa/shoppingonline.html)  
[Visit the Mastercard® SecureCode™ website](http://www.mastercard.com/uk/cardholderservices/securecode/index.html)

Once you have registered and created your own private password with your card issuer, you will be automatically prompted at the checkout when the card is being processed to provide this password each time you make a purchase.

Please note: Your Verified by Visa and Mastercard® SecureCode™ password is related to your credit/debit cards and is not your Millets.co.uk customer account password. Millets.co.uk does not have access to your Verified by Visa or Mastercard® SecureCode™ password.  


## Phising

Phising is the practice of tricking someone into giving confidential information. Examples include falsely claiming to be a legitimate company when sending an email to a user, in an attempt to get the user to send private information that will be used for identity theft and fraud.

Millets will never ask you to send any personal details via email. If we require such details, for security reasons we will ask you to contact us by telephone. Should you receive an email claiming to be from Millets, Blacks Leisure Group and/or The Outdoor Group Limited requesting this kind of information please do not respond but contact us immediately.
