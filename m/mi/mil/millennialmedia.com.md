# Privacy Policy | Millennial Media

**Company Privacy Policy**

Millennial Media is committed to protecting consumer privacy and to clearly informing users about the collection and use of information when using our services. As a result, we have put together this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect and use certain information. This Privacy Policy applies to Millennial Media´s mobile advertising products and services, as well as our websites located at [www.millennialmedia.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20100530224527id_/http://www.millennialmedia.com/) and [www.decktrade.com](http://www.decktrade.com/).

**Website Data Collection**

Millennial Media is the sole owner of the information collected on our websites, [www.millennialmedia.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20100530224527id_/http://www.millennialmedia.com/) and [www.decktrade.com](http://www.decktrade.com/). We do not share, sell, rent, or provide this data to any other parties. Millennial Media collects this data and uses it exclusively to provide requested information to prospective clients and to establish self-service advertiser and publisher accounts.

**Links to Third-Party Sites**

Millennial Media´s websites contain links to other websites. Millennial Media is not responsible for the privacy practices of these websites. Specifically, the [www.millennialmedia.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20100530224527id_/http://www.millennialmedia.com/) website links to sites providing news coverage, to partner sites for case studies, and to industry association sites of which Millennial Media is a member. The [www.decktrade.com](http://www.decktrade.com/) site links to individual advertiser and publisher websites to enable account owners to review and approve campaign setup and delivery options.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data**

Millennial Media uses technology to uniquely identify most mobile devices to deliver better targeted marketing messages to consumers. We believe that the presentation of more relevant services assist in providing a more meaningful mobile web experience. For example, this technology enables Millennial Media to limit the number of times a specific message is presented to a consumer (frequency capping) as well as to support used-defined product category preferential marketing.

**Opt Out**

Consumers may choose to opt out of targeting that relies on the unique identification of their mobile device. Once the opt out has been completed, the consumer will still receive advertising messages, however these will be based on generic factors such as time of day or the current website page content.

If viewing this page with your mobile device, click on the following link to opt out:

**Third-Party Websites**

Our Service may contain links to third-party services. This Privacy Policy does not extend to those sites and services, and Millennial Media is not responsible for the security and privacy practices of those sites.

**Children´s Privacy**

Millennial Media is very sensitive to the issue of children´s privacy. Millennial Media´s websites, products, and services are not developed for, or directed at, children. If you believe your child has provided Millennial Media with personally identifiable data, or registered at one of Millennial Media´s websites, and you would like to have the data removed, please contact us.

**Security**

Millennial Media views security to be equally as important as privacy. To that end, we have designed and deployed hardware, software, and networking solutions to reasonably secure and protect access to our systems and data.

**Legal Disclaimer**

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our websites.

**Changes to Privacy Policy**

Strong consumer privacy rights are fundamental to the success of Millennial Media and to the mobile advertising industry as a whole. Millennial Media is committed to continually examining and reviewing its privacy practices, and may make changes to its Privacy Policy. In the event that any material changes are made to the company´s privacy practices, we will promptly make changes to this privacy policy that discloses the changes.
