**_Installment Billing Details:_**  
Installment billing is available for credit card orders only and is subject to approval. (Debit cards may be used however charges will be preauthorized and funds will be reserved in your account prior to billing.) Merchandise total must exceed $60 after discounts, promotions, and gift certificates have been applied to your order. Your merchandise total will be divided into three payments. The first payment will include shipping & handling fees and sales tax and will be charged to your credit card on the date we ship your order. The balance due will be divided into two equal monthly payments each commencing 30 days from the date of your previous payment. We will automatically charge your credit card until full payment is received. In the case of split shipments, drop shipments, or backorders your payment dates may change based on when your items ship. The Miles Kimball Company reserves the right to demand payment in full if a payment cannot be obtained at the time of a billing.
