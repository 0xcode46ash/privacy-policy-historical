As you navigate through and interact with our Website, or when you download, access and use the App, we may use automatic data collection technologies.  These technologies do not identify you as an individual, but do collect information regarding your internet service provider, computer, mobile device and connected tools.  An example of such technology would be the use of browser cookies. The type of such automatically collected information includes:

• Usage Details. When you access and use the App, Website, or One Key Tools we may automatically collect certain details of your access to and use of the Website, One Key Tools or App, including traffic data, location data, tool connection and performance data, logs and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on or through the App or Website.

With respect to use of One Key Tools, the One Key Tools contain technology that identify the serial number and type of the tool (saw, drill, etc.) and broadcasts this information as a “Advertisement” that can be read by phones utilizing the App in the surrounding area.    All Apps monitor for such Advertisements, even if the App is being used by another on another’s device.  The App will from time to time transmit the GPS location from the phone and Advertisement information received from the One Key Tool’s whose Advertisements were detected by the App on the phone. While the GPS function of the phone will be used to identify the location of any One Key Tool (yours or others) whose Advertisements are detected by the App, no information identifying the owner of the One Key Tool whose Advertisement was detected by the App will be accessible or provided to the owner of the One Key App.  Furthermore, no information regarding the App is provided to the One-Key Tool.  The owner of the One-Key Tool can access the most recent location information Advertisement regarding their own One-Key Tool by accessing their own App account to assist them in finding a lost tool.
