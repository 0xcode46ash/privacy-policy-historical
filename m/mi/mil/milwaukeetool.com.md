## IP Addresses, Internet Browsers, Operating Systems, Domain Name

When you enter our website, we may collect your computer’s IP address. The IP address does not identify you as an individual, but does identify your Internet service provider. Other non-personally identifiable information that we may collect include the type of Internet browser used, the type of computer operating system used, and the domain name of the website from which you visited our site. The information is aggregated to provide broad demographic information, such as the geographic location of visitors and how long they stay on our site. Collecting this type of information allows us to administer our site, diagnose server problems, analyze trends and statistics, and provide better customer service. 

## Cookies

When you visit our website, we may send “cookies” to your computer. A cookie is a small text file or piece of data that a website you visit can place or save onto your computer. Cookies do not themselves contain any personally identifiable information. However, if you provide such personally identifiable information to us (such as by registering for an Internet related service or password provided by us), such information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. There are two types of cookies. The first type saves a file for a longer period of time onto your computer, and which can remain on your computer after you shut it off. Such cookie could, for example, be used to tell a visitor what information on the website has been updated since his or her last visit to that website. 

The second type of cookie is called “session cookie.” While you are visiting a website, session cookies are temporarily stored in your computer’s memory. This could be done, for example, to keep track of what language you have chosen at the website. Session cookies are not stored for a long period of time on your computer, since they disappear when you close your web browser. We may use third parties to assist us in collecting or processing information obtained through cookies. 

We may use cookies for a number of reasons, such as: 

  * to compile anonymous statistics related to patterns and trends of browsing;
  * to conduct marketing research;
  * to personalize website content or functions;
  * to provide assistance to, or track site visits of, individual registered users of certain Internet-based services;
  * to enable persons with passwords to re-enter certain web pages without having to re-type previously typed information.
