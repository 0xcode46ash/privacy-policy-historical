**Minor League Baseball™ Privacy Policy**

We at Minor League Baseball and the entities that make up Minor League Baseball recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of certain information (“information”) collected about our fans (referred to as “fans,” “you” or “your”). This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. At Minor League Baseball, it is our intention to give you an understanding about how we collect your information and the use we make of it.

Minor League Baseball gathers two types of information about fans: data that fans provide through optional, voluntary registration on our site; and data Minor League Baseball gathers through aggregated tracking, mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. Such information enables us to tailor our content to fit fans’ needs better and to help our advertisers understand our audience. Minor League Baseball will not disclose personal information to third parties without your consent, except as may be noted in this Privacy Policy or disclosed to you when the information is submitted.

**_How does Minor League Baseball collect information?_**

We collect information by specifically requesting it from you. Generally this occurs when you register at a site or request information or a service. Usually, the Minor League Baseball sites use your information to operate the sites and to deliver services. Minor League Baseball sites also use your information to inform you about other products or services available from Minor League Baseball and businesses who support Minor League Baseball.

_Use of Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses_

An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the Internet so that your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as “Web Servers,” that “serve up” Web pages.

Minor League Baseball collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When fans request pages, our servers log the Fans’ IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a Fan’s session will be logged, but the Fan will remain anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a Fan when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our site terms of use of terms of service or to protect our service, site, fans or others.

What are cookies? Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes, which information is stored in a file on your computer. Cookies make Websurfing easier for you by saving your preferences so that we can use the saved information to facilitate your use of our Web site when you return to the site. Cookies do not tell us your individual identity unless you have chosen to provide it to us. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and as such, you’ll find that most major Web sites use them.

By showing how and when Fans use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our Fans’ needs.

Most cookies expire after a defined period of time, or you can delete your cookie file at any time. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of minorleaguebaseball.com will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences.

Minor League Baseball has two primary uses for its cookies. First, we use them to specify a Fan’s preferences. Second, we use cookies to track Fans’ Web site usage trends and patterns. This helps us understand our Fans’ needs better and improve the site. While both of these activities depend on the use of cookies, you have the option of disabling the cookies via your browser preferences.

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. Minor League Baseball does not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the internet industry.

**_With whom does Minor League Baseball share my information?_**

As a general rule, Minor League Baseball will not disclose any specific personal information that you submit to us about you (“Personal Information”) in a manner that connects you with the Personal Information, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following described some of the ways that your Personal Information may be disclosed.

_Business Partners & Sponsors_

: Minor League Baseball may disclose some or all of your Personal Information to business partners or sponsors, but this use will be specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you grant Minor League Baseball permission to transfer your Personal Information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request.

_Third Party & Aggregate Data_

: From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. Minor League Baseball will share your name and email address with such third parties. Also, Minor League Baseball may keep track of what portions of the Web site Fans are visiting and Fan statistics, and aggregate this information to help us create a better experience for users of our Web site. This is all done without knowing your name of other Personal Information in order to describe our viewers and services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

_Other_

: Minor League Baseball may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Minor League Baseball’s terms of use or terms of service, or may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with any of Minor League Baseball’s or its member clubs’ rights or property, other Minor League Baseball Fans, or anyone else. Minor League Baseball may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain service and improve our products and services.

**_What happens when you link to a third party site?_**

You should be aware that when you are on Minor League Baseball’s site you could hyperlink or be directed to other sites that are beyond our control and/or outside our service. For example, if you “click” on a banner advertisement the “click” may transfer you off the minorleaguebaseball.com site. These other sites may include sites of advertisers, sponsors and partners that may show Minor League Baseball’s or its member clubs’ logos as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to you, collect data, or solicit information.

Minor League Baseball does not control such sites, and, therefore is not responsible for their contents or the hyperlinks or advertising they choose to place on such sites. Minor League Baseball’s inclusion of hyperlinks to these sites do not imply any endorsement of the material on such sites or any association with their operators. Minor League Baseball’s policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, which is beyond Minor League Baseball’s control.

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out information online (for example, via message boards or chat) that information can be collected and used by people you don’t know. While Minor League Baseball strives to protect fans’ information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you disclose such information at your own risk.

**_Is my information secure from others using the minorleaguebaseball.com site?_**

The security of all information associated with our Fans is an important concern to us. We exercise care in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, Minor League Baseball can’t ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, Minor League Baseball uses commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, such as firewalls. However, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet.

By using this site, you signify your agreement to Minor League Baseball’s Privacy Policy. **IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SITE.** Your continued use of Minor League Baseball’s site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
