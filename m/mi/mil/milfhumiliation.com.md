milfhumiliation.com may use this information to provide, maintain, protect and improve the services it offers users.  milfhumiliation.com may also use this information to protect its rights or the rights of its users.  Any of this information may be disclosed or otherwise used in any manner milfhumiliation.com sees fit with regard to investigating and stopping the suspected or actual piracy of copyrighted content.

**Information Sharing**

milfhumiliation.com will share personal information with companies or individuals outside of milfhumiliation.com under limited circumstances:

-milfhumiliation.com has obtained your consent to release personal information.

-The information is being shared with a subsidiary or milfhumiliation.com affiliate.

-Access, use or distribution of your personal information is, in milfhumiliation.com’s good faith belief, reasonably required to a) satisfy an applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable government request (e.g. a warrant, subpoena or other court order), b) enforce the Terms and Conditions, and investigate their breach, c) detect and prevent security issues, d) protect against harm to milfhumiliation.com or its users, and e) to pursue good faith allegations of piracy brought by milfhumiliation.com or third parties.
