At Specialty Fashion Group we use your personal information primarily for the purposes of: marketing and promotion, internal accounting and auditing, recording proof of purchase, validating cheque transactions, regulatory reporting and compliance, recruitment and servicing our relationship with you. We may communicate additional purposes for use and disclosure of personal information at the point of collection.

Specialty Fashion Group may engage other persons or organisations (for example, loyalty program administrators and partners, data analysis specialists, statement producers, data mail houses, data processing organisations, marketing researchers, specialist call centres and service providers) to assist Specialty Fashion Group in carrying out the above purposes. Your personal information may be disclosed to such persons or organisations for these purposes and, in providing a service, they may contact you directly. In some circumstances, they may disclose personal information they collected from you to Specialty Fashion Group for one or more of the purposes already mentioned.

The nature of the information collected will vary depending on the purpose for which the information was collected. However, the information we usually collect includes name, address, credit card details, phone number, email address, work history etc. This information allows us to provide services to you or otherwise interact with you. If you do not provide us with the personal information requested, we may not be able to provide the services or interact.

 **Accuracy of and access to personal information**

We endeavour to take all reasonable steps to ensure the personal information we hold is up-to-date, complete and accurate.

At any time, you may request a copy of your personal information held by us by contacting us using the contact information provided above. If you believe any of your personal information held by us is incomplete or inaccurate, please notify us in writing so that we may update that information. Every reasonable effort will be made to provide or update personal information on request, unless an exemption under the NPPs applies. In these circumstances we will provide written notification as to why your request has been refused.

 **Data security**

Specialty Fashion Group will endeavour to take reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We adopt practices to prevent unauthorised access to our premises, systems or physical storage locations. Personal information that is no longer required will be destroyed or de-identified, as appropriate. Online transaction security

Specialty Fashion Group takes online transaction security seriously. We process online transactions using at least a 128 bit SSL encryption to a secure eWay credit card payment gateway system.

Specialty Fashion Group collects but does not store your credit card details on its databases or servers. You will need to enter those details each time you make a purchase on our websites. However, we do maintain records of your transaction history. As mentioned above, Specialty Fashion Group adopts practices to prevent unauthorised access to such records. Identifiers and anonymity

Where personal information is collected, it will usually be identified by a common identifier such as the name of the individual, address or transaction details. Specialty Fashion Group will not use identifiers assigned by a government agency, such as tax file numbers, to identify your personal information.

Wherever it is lawful and practical, Specialty Fashion Group will give you the option of not identifying yourself when interacting with us. Transfer overseas

We may transfer your personal information to a person or organisation in a foreign country, but only if the transfer is permitted under the NPPs. The NPPs permit such transfers in circumstances including if you consent to the transfer or if we have taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information transferred will not be held, used or disclosed by the recipient inconsistently with the NPPs.

 **Sensitive information**

Where Specialty Fashion Group collects personal information that is also sensitive information, such as health details, we will only do so if the individual has consented or the collection is required or permitted by law, including where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal or equitable claim.

We will make every reasonable effort to resolve the problem to the satisfaction of all parties and/or provide you with a response to your query or comment.
