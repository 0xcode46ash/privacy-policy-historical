 **How does EFTel collect personal information?**

When you first buy a service from us we will collect certain mandatory information from you such as your name (and in case of company applications the name of the directors of the company), contact details, and date of birth. Your use of the service will generate usage and billing information which is automatically collected by our systems.  
We may also collect information from third parties such as:

>   * Credit providers or credit reporting agencies contacted by us (or by external service providers on our behalf) in the course of carrying out a credit check. 
>   * Other entities who provide services to us related to the provision of services provided to you. 
>   * Government agencies which administer laws regulating telecommunication service providers, or complaint resolution processes established under those laws. 
> 


  
**How do we use your personal information?**  
EFTel respects your privacy. As a result, EFTel does not trade, rent or sell your personal information or corporate information. The primary purpose for which we use your personal information is to provide you with the services you have purchased from us. In the course of providing an internet service to you we may also use your personal information for related purposes including the following: 

>   * Provisioning and connecting your service. 
>   * Credit checking. 
>   * Providing you with customer service. 
>   * Billing you for that service. 
>   * Investigating and resolving complaints and faults in relation to your service. 
>   * Following up and payments you owe us. 
> 


We may also use your personal information to tell you about our other products and services provided by EFTel in conjunction with either our related bodies corporate or our business partners or associates.  
In delivering some services, EFTel contracts out some various works to external service providers. EFTel may disclose personal information held by it to these organisations, but only to the extent to allow those services to be delivered.  
EFTel may disclose your personal information to other telecommunications service and equipment providers, EFTel's related corporate bodies, credit providers, credit reporting agencies, organisations to whom EFTel outsources services and domain registrars located locally or overseas.

 **Access to Personal Information**

Generally, you have the right to see or obtain a copy of personal information about you that we may hold.  
EFTel will handle requests for access to personal information in accordance with the National Privacy Principles. To request access to your personal information, please contact us on (08) 9420 9999. We will ask you several questions so we can be sure to verify your identity, and then if possible provide you with the requested information over the telephone.  
If we cannot immediately provide you with the information you require we will send you an acknowledgement by email or post within seven days. We will respond to your request within 28 days.   
Depending on the information you request, and how long it takes us to compile it, and respond to your request, we may charge you for the administrative costs of providing the information to you.  
There may be rare circumstances in which we may refuse to give you access to your personal information where giving you access: 

>   * would have an unreasonable impact on other people's privacy. 
>   * would prejudice any negotiations we are having with you. 
>   * would prejudice an investigation of unlawful activity, or activities by law enforcement agencies. 
>   * would prejudice billing you for that service. 
> 


If you believe that we hold personal information about you that you consider to be inaccurate, incomplete or out of date you should tell us by calling (08) 9420 9999. We will amend any inaccurate, incomplete or out of date information.

 **How do we protect your personal information?**
