# Privacy Policy | MILLY

####  **Last Updated July 2014**

This privacy statement explains the MILLY policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. The terms of this privacy statement apply to information collected from you unless different terms are specified as part of a special offer or in another form or contract MILLY provides you. The links below provide more detailed information about the MILLY privacy practices:

_What constitutes“personal information”?_  
Personal information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a customer's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, or information about activities directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases. Personal information also includes information that you choose to provide to MILLY or that you ask us to provide to companies. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products you purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products purchased by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and services to customer desires.
