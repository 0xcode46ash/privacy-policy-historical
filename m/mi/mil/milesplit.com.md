# Mile Split Network

Updated: August 24, 2006 

MileSplit, Inc. will always look after the best interests and the privacy of our visitors first. We will never sell your personal information to a third party or provide it to individuals outside of our company without your specific permission, where required by law, or to protect public safety. 

We decided to structure our privacy policy a little different than many sites: in plain (non-technical) English that is simple to understand. We value transparency and trust. And we hope to earn and keep your trust. 

Updates to this privacy policy may be made periodically and will be posted here. 

**What data do you collect about visitors?**

Traffic patterns are monitored on an aggregate basis. In other words, we keep track of what pages within our web site people are going to, what geographic areas they're coming from, what web site referred them to us, etc. However, that information is never tied to a specific user. 

In order to access certain parts of the web site (such as the forums or subscription only areas) we ask you to register to create an account with us. When setting you your account, you define your privacy settings so no one outside of our company will have access to your real name, location, email address, etc. unless you let them. We will not sign you up for any mailing lists and while we may contact you, it will only be for specific information regarding your account (not generic bulk emails) or to get an important message out to our users. We have no desire to clog your inbox with garbage and we won't do it. 

**What are cookies and how do you use them?**

Cookies are a small file that your web browser stores in order for a web site to store a bit of information that it can retrieve later. A web site can only read cookie data that it wrote and not cookies that other web sites set. We use cookies to allow you to login, remember your preferences, and other such things. 

**Will you provide my personal information to others?**

Simply: No. The only exception would be where we are legally required to do so or in order to protect public safety. We will never sell or otherwise provide your information to a third party without your specific permission. 

**How do I change my personal information or privacy settings in my account?**

You can log in to your account (if you created one) and change your information or settings at any time. Just login and then click on the "Profile" link at the top right of any page. From your profile there will be edit buttons that allow you to make changes to different areas. You will not be able to change your login name or email address. This is because both of these must be unique in our system and also because we require valid email addresses. 

**Why should I trust you?**

Because we're good people! And we hate spam email just as much as you do! 

**How will you secure my credit card/financial information?**

We do not store any credit card or other financial data.
