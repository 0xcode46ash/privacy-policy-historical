# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to Milestone Systems. So we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information.

 **Collection and use of personal information**  
Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person. You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Milestone Systems or an Milestone Systems affiliated company. Milestone Systems and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content and advertising. Below are some examples of the types of personal information Milestone Systems may collect and how we may use it.

  
**What personal information we collect**  
When you create an Milestone Systems ID, sign up for our free newsletter or participate in an online survey and compititions, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences. When you share your content with family and friends using Milestone Systems or invite others to join you on Milestone Systems forums, Milestone Systems may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address and phone number.

  
**How we use your personal information**  
The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Milestone Systems’s latest announcements. It also helps us to improve our services, content and advertising. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences. We also use personal information to help us develop and improve our website, services, content, and advertising. From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about changes to our terms, conditions and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Milestone Systems, you may not opt out of receiving these communications. We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis and research to improve Milestone Systems’s website and services. If you enter into a competitions or similar promotion from our partners we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.

  
**Collection and use of non-personal information**  
We also collect non-personal information − data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it: We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where an Milestone Systems visitor lives so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our website, services and advertising. We also may collect information regarding visitors activities on our website and from our other services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our visitors and to understand which parts of our website and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.

**Cookies and other technologies**  
Milestone Systems’s website, online services, interactive applications, email messages, newsletters, advertisements and our partners may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

Milestone Systems and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile website and advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.  
Milestone Systems and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Milestone  
Systems more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you when you get our newsletters.

If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the Security pane to disable cookies. On your Milestone Systems mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, and then to the Cookies section. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the Milestone Systems website will not be available once cookies are disabled.

As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the website, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Milestone Systems may use this information in our marketing and advertising services. In some of our email messages and newsletters, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Milestone Systems website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages or newsletters. Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.

  
**Disclosure to third parties**  
At times Milestone Systems may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with Milestone Systems to provide products and services, or that help Milestone Systems market to customers. Personal information will only be shared by Milestone Systems to provide or improve our website, services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.

  
**Service providers**  
Milestone Systems shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our website and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Milestone Systems operates.

  
**Others**  
It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Milestone Systems to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.

  
**Protection of personal information**  
Milestone Systems takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Milestone Systems website may use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is collected. To make purchases from these services, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal information while it’s transmitted over the Internet. When you use some Milestone Systems services, or applications or post on an Milestone Systems forum or social networking service, the personal information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.

  
**Integrity and retention of personal information**  
Milestone Systems makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

  
**Access to personal information**  
You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate and up to date by logging in to your account at http://www.Milestone Systems.com/login.php and for receiving our newsletter use the profile link at the end of our newsletters.

  
**Children**  
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.

  
**Third-Party sites and services**  
Milestone Systems websites, applications and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our services may also use or offer products or services from third parties − for example, in a competition. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.

  
**International users**  
Information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy. Milestone Systems abides by the “safe harbor” framework set forth by the The European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information collected by organizations in the European Economic Area. Learn more about The European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection Program.

  
**Our companywide commitment to your Privacy**  
To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Milestone Systems employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.

  
**Privacy questions**  
If you have any questions or concerns about Milestone Systems’s Privacy Policy or data processing, please contact us.

  
**Updating of Privacy Policy**  
Milestone Systems may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. When we change the policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy.
