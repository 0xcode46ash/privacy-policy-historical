This means that we are responsible for what happens to the information that you give to us.

## The Millet Sports' Privacy Policy

We take the safety and security of your details seriously at Millet Sports, which is why whenever we collect any details from you we will always use a secure encrypted form to do so. When you submit your details to us they are encrypted into a secure code that only we have the key to decipher.

We keep all of your personal information on a secure server and treat all information you provide us with as confidential. For added security, we do not keep any card payment details on our database. Instead, we use a secure payment gateway to verify all transactions and guard against fraud, which only passes a secure code to us that does not contain any sensitive data once it has approved the transaction.

We only use your personal information for the following purposes:

  * Processing your order(s)

  * Administering your account (if you have one)

  * Communicating the status of your order to you

  * To administer this website

  * To serve website content to you

  * To notify you of special offers, products and services that you may be interested in provided you have consented for us to do so

  * To run any competitions that you have entered

  * To administer any promotional offers or discounts that you are entitled to




We may contact you using any of the information you have provided us, such as by email or telephone for the above purposes. If you have opted in to receive marketing communications you are able to unsubscribe at anytime just by letting us know via email to enquiries@milletsports.co.uk.

From time to time your personal information may be processed by systems which are located outside the United Kingdom. Where this happens, we will ensure that your information will be kept secure and your privacy rights remain protected consistent with the Data Protection Act 1998.

We also use your data for marketing purposes which may mean that you will receive marketing communications from us, other companies within the [_JD Sports Fashion Group_](http://www.milletsports.co.uk/about/history/group-brands) or carefully selected third parties. However if you do receive marketing communications from other companies, we will endeavour to ensure that the company in question and it's products will be as relevant to you as possible.

We require that these companies treat your personal information as confidential and comply fully with current UK consumer and Data Protection legislation. Aside from this, we will not pass on your personal information to any third parties unless you give us your permission to do so.

If the police or any other regulatory or government authority requests your personal or user information in relation to an investigation into suspected illegal activities, then we may be obliged to provide it to them.
