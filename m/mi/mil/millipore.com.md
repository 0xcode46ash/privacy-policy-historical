Millipore Security protocols adhere to the latest US standards; your information is encrypted during your e-commerce sessions with Millipore. We do not store credit card or purchasing card information on our web server, and do require a re-entry of the credit card number for each purchase. This is an added level of security, and helpful in laboratories or purchasing departments with multiple users of a central computer. Security audits are conducted by third parties in order to further ensure security.

**Millipore Online Privacy Policy**  


This Policy relates only to our online information collection and use practices. At Millipore we recognize that many consumers who visit our web site are concerned about any information they provide us on-line, and how we maintain and use this information. To address these concerns and to demonstrate our commitment to privacy we have developed and implemented this Privacy Policy for our domestic (i.e., U.S.) company. This Policy relates only to our online information collection and use practices. As this policy may change from time to time, we encourage you to periodically check it. In short, we do the following: • We only collect personally identifiable information that you voluntarily and knowingly provide us.  
• We use the information that you provide us only for the purpose(s) for which you specifically provided it or for specific additional purposes for which we receive your prior consent.  
• We do not share any information you provide us with anyone outside of Millipore Corporation, except for suppliers who assist us in maintaining and managing the activities on our site. These suppliers are legally obligated to maintain the confidentiality of any information we provide them, including your information.  
• We may use a technology called “cookies” to enhance your experience on our site.  
• We employ appropriate security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of any information you provide us.  
• We provide you with choice and control over the collection and use of any personally identifiable information that you provide us on-line, and a means for updating, correcting or removing this information .Below is a more detailed explanation of our policy in each of these areas.

**Information We Collect and How We Use It**

We only collect personally identifiable information on a voluntary basis. We do not require that you provide this information to gain access to our site, and we do not require you to disclose more information than is reasonably needed to participate in an activity on our site. We collect personally identifiable information primarily to e-mail updates and news, to respond to your questions or suggestions, and to complete online transactions. We do not sell any information we gather at our web site to anyone outside of Millipore Corporation. We do not transfer or disclose any information we gather at our web site to anyone outside of Millipore Corporation without your prior consent, except (1) in cases where we believe in good faith that we have a legal obligation to disclose such information, and (2) to certain suppliers that assist Millipore in maintaining and managing the activities on its web site. Please be assured that these suppliers are legally obligated to maintain the confidentiality of this information and do not acquire any rights to use your information for their own benefit. We may share non-identifiable aggregate information about our users with business partners and other third parties in an effort to customize or enhance the content and advertising on our site for our users. We do reserve the right, in connection with the potential sale or transfer of the interests of Millipore and its subsidiaries and affiliates, to sell or transfer your information (including but not limited to your address, name, age, gender, zip code, state, and country of residency and other information that your provide through other communications) to a third party entity that (1) concentrates its business in a similar practice or service, (2) agrees to be Millipore’s successor in interest with regard to the maintenance and protection of the information collected, and (3) agrees to the obligations of this privacy policy.

We periodically conduct polls and surveys on our site. The information we collect from these polls and surveys is only for Millipore’s use. If sample answers to polls or surveys are posted our web site, no identifiable information is included.

We collect this, and other information, in order to fill your order, to communicate with you about your order and to send you promotional materials. Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make changes and additions to the information it contained and these changes will be automatically kept for future use.
