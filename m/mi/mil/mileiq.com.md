PRIVACY POLICY  
Last Revised: October 27, 2014**

This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Mobile Data Labs, Inc. (“Mobile Data Labs”). This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you visit our website, use our mobile service application that passively tracks miles driven so as to make it easier to classify reimbursable deductible business miles (“MileIQ”) or otherwise interact with us.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time-to-time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as a statement provided via MileIQ or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access MileIQ to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

**Location Information**

When you first launch MileIQ, you will be asked to consent to MileIQ's collection of location information. We require this location information in order for MileIQ to function as designed.

If you consent to our collection of location information, you may subsequently stop the collection of this location information at any time by pausing location tracking from within the application’s settings menu, or by changing the location preferences on your mobile device. However, if you stop the collection of this location information, MileIQ can no longer provide information about your drives.

If you consent to our collection of location information and you do not subsequently stop the collection of this location information, MileIQ will continue to collect this location information.

If you consent to our collection of location information, subsequently stop the collection of this location information and later consent to the collection of this location information, MileIQ will resume the collection of location information.

You may also stop our collection of location information by following the standard uninstall process to remove MileIQ from your device.

All transit and drive data associated with a particular driver can be deleted from all active databases upon request. Once this data has been deleted, it cannot be recovered. However, we may not remove information from our backup systems.

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of MileIQ.

**Promotional Communications**

You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Mobile Data Labs by following the instructions in those communications or by changing your notification settings in the application’s settings menu. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.

**Your California Privacy Rights**

California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please contact us at [support@mileiq.com](mailto:support@mileiq.com). However, please note that under the law, services such as MileIQ that permit California residents to opt into or opt out of this type of sharing are not required to provide such information upon receiving a request, but rather may respond by notifying the user of his or her right to prevent the disclosure. To opt out of having information about you shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes, please email us at [support@mileiq.com](mailto:support@mileiq.com).
