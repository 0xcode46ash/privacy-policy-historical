**Mixgame.net a safe place to play for free**

There is a dusine of gaming sites on internet that provide games, but it is a largely unregulated environment, and this naturally presents some issues regarding user safety. Mixgame.net is a general audience website, which appeals to users of both genders, all ages, and many nationalities. Some users (depending on age, internet experience, and other factors) will be more vulnerable than others, and so it is important to know about the features - and perhaps more importantly, the absence of features - which help make Mixgame a safer place to play.

The games on Mixgame.net have been systematically checked to ensure that they are appropriate for the various demographic groups which are likely to play them. While it can't be said that none of the games feature violence, we have tried to keep the content made available on Mixgame.net consistent with what would be regarded as reasonable to show on a television channel throughout a typical day. We have worked hard to ensure that players on mixgame.net are not inappropriately exposed to bad language, overtly sexual themes or imagery, references to illegal drug use, scenarios or characters glorifying drinking, smoking, or gambling, or depictions of extreme violence and gore. Users should be aware that the games made available to users on Mixgame.net may vary according to the geo location of the user, the time of day the site is being accessed, and other factors.
