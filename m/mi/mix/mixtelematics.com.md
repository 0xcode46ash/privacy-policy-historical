**For use on www.mixtelematics.com website**

**General**

Thank you for your interest in the MiX Telematics Website at www.mixtelematics.com (referred to briefly as “MiX Telematics” in this statement). The issue of data protection and confidentiality is a topic taken very seriously by us, and we follow the applicable German and European data protection regulations. With this statement on data protection measures, we would therefore like to provide you with information on the kind of data which we – that is, MiX Telematics and its subsidiaries – may wish to save and how we use such data. 

**Storage and use of data**

As a visitor to our Website, you will remain anonymous. The data we save and analyse is used for statistical purposes only, for instance to ensure the continuous improvement of our services. The data we save to our servers contain the name of your Internet service provider, the Website from which you have visited us, the MiX Telematics Web pages you have looked up, your IP address and the date and duration of your visit. 

**Collection, processing and use of personal data**

We only collect and process personal data if you make use of specific services and if you have voluntarily given us your express consent. You may do so, for instance, as part of a registration procedure, by ticking a box to confirm that you accept the terms of the privacy policy or completing a form or by sending us an e-mail. Unless we are subject to other legal commitments, we will only use your personal data for the purposes for which you have given your consent. 

Your personal data will not be shared by us with third parties unless you have given your consent (e.g. permission for use by MiX Telematics subsidiaries) or unless we are instructed to do so by the authorities. If you have given permission for use by MiX Telematics subsidiaries, then these subsidiaries are obliged to treat your personal data as specified in this Privacy Protection Statement. The same commitment is given by MiX Telematics on behalf of other third parties, to ensure that they process your personal data as specified for their original recording purpose. This concerns, for instance, deliveries, analyses and technical services. 

If data has been released for use by MiX Telematics subsidiaries and if such permission involves data transfer to other countries, MiX Telematics will ensure that the data importer is placed under a suitable level of data protection commitment. 

**Data storage**

We only store data for the period of time that is required to conduct the service you have requested. 

**Right of access, correction and objection**

If you have shared personal data with us you are entitled to review and correct any of your personal data we have saved, and you may withdraw your consent to the use of your data at any time, affecting all future use. All you need to do is send a message by e-mail for the Attention of the Corporate Privacy Officer at [ info@mixtelematics.com](mailto:info@mixtelematics.com)

**Data protection and security**

All our staff and all third parties involved in data processing are bound by an obligation of confidentiality in the use of personal data. Our data protection measures are continually updated, reflecting technical developments. 

**Links from our site**

Where our Website contains links to other websites and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for your information only. We have no control over the content of those websites or resources, and accept no liability for them whatsoever or for any loss and/or damage that may arise out of or in connection with your use of them. 

**Contact**

If you have any problems, questions or suggestions, please contact our Corporate Privacy Officer at [info@mixtelematics.com](mailto:info@mixtelematics.com)
