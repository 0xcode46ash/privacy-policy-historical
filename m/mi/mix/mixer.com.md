Mixxer, Inc. ("Mixxer") takes your privacy seriously. Please read this to learn about our policy regarding visitor and member privacy.

 **What this Privacy Policy Covers**

This Privacy Policy covers Mixxer's treatment of anonymous and personally identifiable information that Mixxer collects when you are on the Web site located at www.mixxer.com, and when you use Mixxer's services. This policy also covers Mixxer's treatment of any personally identifiable information that Mixxer's business partners share with Mixxer.

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Mixxer does not own or control or to people that Mixxer does not employ or manage.

 **Information Collection and Use**

Mixxer logs non-personally-identifiable (anonymous) information including IP address, page requests, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the Web site, track usage and improve the Web site services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members.

Once you register with Mixxer and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. Mixxer collects personally identifiable information when you register for a Mixxer account and when you use the service. Mixxer may also receive personally identifiable information from our business partners. When you register with Mixxer, we may ask for your name, email address, and cell phone number, carrier, and model. When you purchase at Mixxer, we may ask you for credit card and other billing information. You may also be requested to provide additional information to Mixxer after you have registered, such as personal interests, gender, age, education and occupation in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other.

User Profile information including members' pictures and user names are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the Mixxer community. Your full name and cell phone number will not be revealed to others unless you choose to make this information available in your profile. Email addresses may be used to send you notifications related to the service and your account; further, you may choose to use your email address to invite new friends to join Mixxer and to receive promotional information.

From time to time, Mixxer or a partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on Mixxer's Web site. You may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or other information or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners if you have explicitly requested to receive information from them. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy policy will apply.

On some pages, you can submit information about other people, such as when you order a gift to be sent to another person. In these instances, we may ask you to provide the recipient's name, mailing address, email address and telephone number. Information about other people will be protected under the other terms of this Privacy Policy.

In addition to processing your orders for the purchase of our services and products, we may use the information you provide to us for sending you special promotions and incentives, to customize the advertising and content you see on our pages, providing additional services, gathering demographic and website usage information, improving our website and the quality of your online visits, and in some cases, to contact you.

Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information to the Web site, that information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Policy, any information Mixxer receives from you is an asset of Mixxer and may be transferred if Mixxer merges with another entity, is consolidated, sells all or part of its assets, or files for bankruptcy.

 **Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members**

You can invite friends to join the service by sending invitations via our automated invitation system. Mixxer may store the email addresses and other information that you provide to send reminders of the invitations. Mixxer does not sell these email addresses and other information (except as otherwise permitted in this Privacy Policy) or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. Any friends that respond to the invitation will be subject to the remaining provisions of this Privacy Policy. Recipients of invitations from Mixxer may contact Mixxer to request the removal of their information from our database.

 **Information Sharing and Disclosure**

Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Mixxer will not provide your personally identifiable information to other companies or people except in the following instances:

  * We have your consent to share the information;
  * We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested;
  * We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Mixxer to provide a product or service to you (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.)
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or
  * We find that your actions on our Web sites violate the Mixxer Terms of Use, or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services.

Your Internet browser has a feature called "cookies" which may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to our site. Mixxer and its agents may set and access Mixxer cookies on your computer. When you interact with the site, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to the Mixxer site, our web server uses cookies to improve your interaction with the site by, for example, remembering your preferences. Mixxer uses cookies to measure your behavior on the web site, to save personal settings on specific pages, to save your username and password so that Mixxer can quickly log you in, to make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in, and to identify the fact that you are a Mixxer member or a prior visitor. If you disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies, you will still be able to browse the web site; however, you may lose some of the functionality provided by the use of cookies. Cookies tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information. 

Mixxer allows other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Mixxer's cookies. 

Mixxer uses web beacons to access our cookies within our network of web sites and in connection with Mixxer products and services.
