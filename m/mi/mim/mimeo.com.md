**What information is collected by Mimeo:**

In order to use the Services, you are required to provide us with an e-mail address and a unique password. In addition, when placing an order with our Site, you are required to provide personally identifying and other information such as your name, phone number, address, payment information (including credit card information), and shipping information (such as third party shipping addresses and shipping preferences).  We may use your e-mail address from time to time send you e-mails regarding events and promotions.  You always have the option to opt out of said e-mails as described below.

Cookies. Our Site uses cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. We use cookies to collect non-personal information such as aggregate use statistics for internal evaluation of our Services. We also use cookies to temporarily identify users as “logged in” to our secure servers. We do not link any personal information to the information stored in cookies. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you will not be able to use our Site, since our databases would no longer be able to identify you as “logged in,” and you may also be unable to fully experience the interactive features of other websites you visit.

Third Party Cookies: We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze non-personal usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our Site to help us administer our Site and improve its quality. Such third parties may use cookies to help track visitor behavior. Such cookies will not be used to associate individual website visitors to any personal information.

**Children’s personally identifiable information:**

The Services are neither directed toward children (under thirteen years of age), nor is it made available to children. We do not knowingly collect any personal information or accept orders from children.

**How the information collected is used:**

The information collected from you when you place an order with our Site is used to contact you in the normal course of business (e.g. shipping documents and confirmation emails). Every time you place an order, we will send you a confirmation regarding your order status using the e-mail address that you have provided. You will know exactly when we have received your order, when the printing job is completed and even when we submit your documents to our partner carriers for shipping. We will provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information  _only as necessary to provide  _these services to us. Once your order has been submitted to the carrier, all delivery service and tracking information is provided by the carrier. We also use your email to send you newsletters and promotions from our Site when you opt to receive this information from us.

We use non-personal information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our Customers and visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Site.

Mimeo does not share any personally identifiable information with third party parties for their promotional purposes. In addition, Mimeo will not use or share your personal information in a manner that differs from what is described in this Privacy Policy without your prior consent.

**Choice/Opt-out:**

Mimeo believes that all e-mails it sends to you after you sign up for an account are designed to help you best use the Services. The solicitations are limited in that they, among other things, will clearly indicate the originator of the e-mail and provide the customer with a method of “opting out” of receiving future communications of a similar nature. Non-essential communications, such as surveys or contests will not be shared with users who have opted out from our mailing list. Such individuals will only receive communications that are necessary for Mimeo to fulfill orders and provide customer service (e.g. -confirmation email, delivery notification, etc). Please note that these communications are part of your Service and you generally cannot opt-out of them as a result.

To opt out of receiving non-essential communications, such as newsletters and promotions, users can click the “unsubscribe” link that is included at the bottom of any and all such communications.

**When your information may be disclosed:**

Mimeo reserves the right to disclose information or documents concerning or submitted by you as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business, including but not limited to complying with a judicial order or with government agencies or law enforcement officials. Specifically, but without limitation, we reserve the right to disclose such information or documents when: you are in violation of our Terms and Conditions or other published guidelines; you partake (or are reasonably suspected of partaking) in any infringing or illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order; in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests, and as otherwise required by law; as well as in response to allegations of infringement or illegality.

In the event of a sale, acquisition or merger of some, or all of Mimeo’s assets, your personal information would likely be a part of the transferred assets. In such an event, we shall notify you via a notice on our Site prior to the transfer, or by email, with your choices on how your information is to be used henceforth.

**Surveys, Sweepstakes and Contests:**

Occasionally, Mimeo may conduct surveys in order to better deliver advertisements and content, and to better understand your needs relating to the Services. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information such as name, email and shipping address and demographic information such as zip code. We will not share your survey information with any third party, except in aggregate form. In addition, if we sponsor a contest/sweepstakes or promotion in conjunction with a third party, we will post relevant privacy information at the point of registration for that specific contest/sweepstakes or promotion so you can determine whether you wish to participate. Mimeo will handle personal information it receives as a result of a joint contest/sweepstakes or promotion or where Mimeo is the sole sponsor in accordance with this privacy policy.

**Blog Disclosure:**

When you select to comment on our blog, you should be aware that any personal information you select to disclose within your comment can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personal information that you choose to submit in these forums.  _To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at  _[customercare@mimeo.com](mailto:customercare@mimeo.com).  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

**How you may access & update your information:**

If you would like to change, update or delete your personal information in our databases, you may do so through your Account Profile, or by contacting our customer care team. We will make reasonable efforts to comply with your request. We shall respond to your inquiry within 30 days of receiving it. Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will remain within Mimeo databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain inaccurate or outdated personal information. The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however Mimeo reserves the right, from time to time, to re-contact former users of the Services for the purpose of informing them of changes in our service or hours of service.

**How your information is protected:**

Mimeo uses an industry-standard security technology called Secure Socket Layer (SSL Encryption), a protocol developed by Netscape, for the secure transmission of sensitive information over the Internet. SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that are transmitted over the SSL connection. Current versions of the Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer and America Online browsers support SSL, as do other browsers, and our Site uses SSL encryption when you transmit sensitive information, such as credit card numbers. Your document is uploaded to us using the same encryption settings your browser uses when connecting to our Site. Web pages that require an SSL connection generally start with “https” instead of “http”, although some pages and frames within pages may be encrypted even without the https address. Your browser’s help files can show you how to verify whether a particular page utilizes SSL.

**Updates to this privacy policy:**

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the “last modified” date at the top of the Privacy Policy. If Mimeo changes any of its policies that affect users’ personal information, the changes will be posted in this document, and prominently on the public and private web sites ([www.mimeo.com](http://www.mimeo.com/) and [my.mimeo.com](http://my.mimeo.com/)) for 30 consecutive business days prior to the implementation of those changes. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.  We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.

**Terms & Conditions:**

Please also visit our Terms & Conditions section establishing the use, disclaimers, and limitations of liability governing the use of our Site at <http://www.mimeo.com/terms-and-conditions/>.

**Third party links:**

The Mimeo web site may contain links to other Internet web sites, including co-branded or other affiliated sites, which may or may not be owned or operated by Mimeo. These linked sites have separate and independent privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only covers our Site and does not cover any other website. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. We strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of those sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these linked sites (including if a specific link does not work).

**Social Media Widgets**

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook and Twitter buttons. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.
