We take the privacy and security of our customers very seriously. That's why we've registered our website, processes, and practices with TRUSTe. Our formal privacy and security policies, in all their detailed splendor, are displayed below. But for those who want the salient details, here are a few key points: 

  * We will not sell, lease, or share your personal information with any other companies, except those who need it to help us serve you (e.g. providing your mailing address to UPS or FedEx for delivery purposes).   

  * We will not spam you. And for those few emails that we do send out, we always include a way for you to unsubscribe from any and all non-essential communications.   

  * When you submit any form or upload any document to Mimeo.com, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL). SSL technology protects your information, using both server authentication and data encryption, ensuring that your data is safe, secure, and available only to registered users in your organization.   

  * Once your documents have been uploaded, they are hosted in our secure server environment. We use firewalls and other advanced technologies to prevent interference or access from outside intruders.

In order to use the Mimeo.com services, each Customer is required to provide us with an e-mail address and a unique password. In addition, when placing an order with Mimeo.com, each Customer is required to provide personally identifying and other information such as the Customer's name, phone number, address, payment information (including credit card information), and shipping information (such as third party shipping addresses and shipping preferences). This information is used to contact the customer in the normal course of business (e.g. shipping documents and confirmation emails). Mimeo will not share our customers' users personally identifiable information for any reason other than what is stated in this privacy policy.

Mimeo.com also collects non-personally identifiable information such as aggregate use statistics, for internal evaluation of our services. We collect such non-personally identifiable information in part through the use of "cookies" (small text files placed on your computer's harddrive). Cookies are used to temporarily identify users as "logged in" to our secure servers. A user's refusal of cookies wouldrender the site virtually unusable, since our databases would no longer be able to identify that user as "logged in." We do not link any personally identifiable information to that which is stored in cookies.

The Services are neither directed toward children (under thirteen years of age), nor is it made available to children. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information or accept orders from children.

  


## How We Use, and Do Not Use, the Information We Gather

Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways Mimeo.com uses the information that it gathers. Mimeo does not share any personally identifiable information with third party providers.  


##   
How We Use, and Do Not Use, Non-Personally Identifiable Information 

We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our Customers and visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Mimeo.com web site.

The Mimeo web site may contain links to other Internet web sites, including co-branded or other affiliated sites, which may or may not be owned or operated by Mimeo. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites, including such sites' use of any information (such as IP number, browser type, or operating system) collected when visitors to the Mimeo web site click through links to those sites. Even though such information might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of those sites.

  


## How we use, and do not use, personally identifiable information

Mimeo.com provides notice to potential customers that personally identifiable information will be collected when a Customer places an order in order to process such order; moreover, this Security and Privacy Policy itself serves as notice that such information is collected under those circumstances. 

Mimeo believes that all emails it sends to you after you sign up for an account are designed to help you best use the Services. The solicitations are limited in that they, among other things, will clearly indicate the originator of the e-mail and provide the customer with a method of "opting out" of receiving future communications of a similar nature. Non-essential communications, such as surveys or contests will not be shared with users who have opted out from our mailing list. Such individuals will only receive communications that are necessary for Mimeo to fulfill orders and provide customer service (e.g. -confirmation email, delivery notification, etc). To opt out of receiving non-essential communications , users can click the "unsubscribe" link that is included at the bottom of any and all such communications.

PLEASE NOTE that despite the disclosure limitation above, Mimeo.com reserves the right to disclose information or documents concerning or submitted by any Customer as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business, including but not limited to complying with judicial order or law enforcement officials. Specifically, but without limitation, we reserve the right to disclose such information or documents when avisitor or Customer is in violation of our Terms and Conditions orother published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any infringing or illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to disclose suchinformation in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests, and as otherwise required by law, as well as in response to allegations of infringement or illegality. We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who maybe using our servers or services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate your membership in connection with any suspected illegal or infringing activity.

## Surveys, Sweepstakes and Contests

Occasionally, Mimeo.com may conduct surveys in order to better deliver advertisements and content, and to better understand your needs relating to theServices. We will not share your survey information with any third party, except in aggregate form. In addition, if we sponsor a contest/sweepstakes or promotion in conjunction with a third party, we will post relevant privacy information at the point of registration for that specific contest/sweepstakes or promotion so you can determinew hether you wish to participate. Mimeo will handle personal information it receives as a result of a joint contest/sweepstakes or promotion or where Mimeo is the sole sponsor in accordance with this privacy policy.

## Changing Personally Identifiable Information 

If you would like to change your personally identifiable information in Mimeo.com's databases, you may do so through your Account Profile, or by contacting our customer care team. We will make reasonable efforts to comply with your request. Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will remain within Mimeo databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain inaccurate or outdated personally identifiable information. The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however Mimeo reserves the right, from time to time, to re-contact former users of the Services for the purpose of informing them of changes in our service or hours of service.

With respect to using your credit card to conduct transactions through the Services, the credit card issuer's policy regarding unauthorized use will determine what limits, if any, exist on your liability. Ifyou feel that you have been a victim of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its own reporting rules and procedures. If you feel that your situation has not been resolved satisfactorily, please contact us at [help@mimeo.com](mailto:help@mimeo.com?subject=Security%20&%20Privacy%20Inquiry) and we will use reasonable efforts to assist you. Please note that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Mimeo.com password, and are responsible for any and all activities, including but not limited to all orders (whether or not such orders were authorized by you), that are made through your Mimeo account. 

Mimeo.com uses an industry-standard security technology called Secure Socket Layer (SSL), a protocol developed by Netscape for the secure transmission of private information over the Internet. SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that are transmitted over the SSL connection. Current versions of the Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer and America Online browsers support SSL, as do other browsers, and Mimeo.com's Web site uses SSL when its customers transmit confidential information, such as credit card numbers. Your document is uploaded to us using the same encryption settings your browser uses when connecting to our site. Web pages that require an SSL connection generally start with "https" instead of "http", although some pages and frames within pages may be encrypted even without the https address. Your browser's help files can show you how to verify whether a particular page utilizes SSL. For more information on SSL, please visit the Webopedia site.

Every time you place an order, we will send you confirmation regarding your order status using the e-mail address that you have provided. You will know exactly when we have received your order, when the printing job is completed and even when we submit your documents to our partner carriers for shipping. Once your order has been submitted to the carrier, all delivery service and tracking information is provided by the carrier.

While Mimeo.com encourages all third parties involved to conform to our security practices, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties with respect to security.
