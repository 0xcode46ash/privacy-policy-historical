Migration Expert Privacy Policy

**Personal Information**

Migration Expert knows that privacy matters, especially in this information age. We have, therefore, made the protection of your privacy our number one priority. We make every effort to ensure your confidentiality and maintain your trust. Read on to learn how we keep your personal information private.

**Information Collection and Use**

We will collect and store your personal information in order to provide you with a highly personalised service. We will NOT, however, use that personal data for purposes beyond those deemed necessary to prepare your Personal Plan.

We will NOT re-sell, distribute, or share your personal data with third parties.

Migration Expert Pty Limited (ACN 101 197 157) is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.

**Virtual Interview**

In order to benefit from our services, a client must first complete the virtual points test and interview process. During the virtual interview, a client is required to give detailed information about their background. This data is used to prepare their Personal Plan.

**Transactions/Ordering**

We request information from the client on our transaction page. A client must provide contact information (e.g. name and address for identity verification purposes) and financial information (e.g. credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes. If we have trouble processing an order, we will contact the client using the contact details they have provided.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the client's hard drive containing information about them. Migration Expert does not use cookies, nor do we have plans to implement such technology in the future.

Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to, or control over, these cookies.

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer our site, track a client's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to identifiable personal information.

**Sharing**

We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can divulge the identify of our clients.

We use a credit card processing company to bill clients for our services. This company does not share, store or use identifiable personal information for any secondary purposes.

**Links**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Migration Expert, are not responsible for the accuracy or the privacy practices of other such sites. We encourage our clients to be aware that when they leave our site, they should read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects identifiable personal information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected on this web site.
