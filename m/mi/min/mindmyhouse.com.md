House sitter members must provide the following information: an email address, a password, a first and last name, a list of the countries members would like to be considered for house sitting assignments in, the beginning and end dates of the period that the member is available for house sitting, an advert describing the house sitting services on offer, a credit or debit card number (if this is the payment option chosen), a home address, a billing address which matches that attached to the card used for payment.

**Q. How does MindMyHouse.com use members’ information?**

Information provided to the site in the course of becoming a member of MindMyHouse.com will only be used to facilitate members’ full and effective use of the site.

MindMyHouse.com will not disclose any of its members’ private information to any third party under normal circumstances. Home owner members’ private information includes: first and last names, email address and password. House sitter members’ private information includes: home address, credit and debit card numbers, billing address and password. 

Neither will MindMyHouse.com individually identify any member to a third party except when required to do so under the law; either in an emergency or to protect the health and safety of its members or the general public.

MindMyHouse.com reserves the right to collate statistical data from members in order to track site usage patterns . This process will not identify any individual member and will only be used in efforts to improve the site and services to members.

**Q. Who sees members’ personal information?**

Only those people working for MindMyHouse.com will be able to see members’ personal information as it is supplied by members and stored in the site’s database. However, many elements of house sitter members’ personal information are viewable online by other registered MindMyHouse.com members. 

MindMyHouse.com recognizes that home owner members may like to preserve their anonymity until they are interviewing house sitting candidates directly. For this reason, home owner members’ email addresses are completely hidden from view online. Home owner members can only be contacted via a blank email contact form on the site. Only registered house sitter members will be able to contact home owner members in this way. However please note that MindMyHouse.com cannot safeguard your privacy if you choose to include personal details (eg. email address) in any adverts you create on the site.

House sitter members’ contact details including first and last names, country of residence, phone numbers (if provided) and an email address can be seen by any person who joins MindMyHouse.com as a member. House sitter members’ home addresses are never displayed online nor given to any third party except when requested by the police in the interest of public safety. 

**Q. Will MindMyHouse.com be sending members any unsolicited material?**

Members will be able to unsubscribe from this mailing list by following the ‘unsubscribe’ directions contained within each such email.
