# Mindomo - Privacy Policy

Expert Software Applications Srl, as the owner of this website, created this privacy statement to demonstrate our commitment to the privacy of our visitors and customers. As a company, we strictly adhere to all industry guidelines and we continually review our policy and procedures to ensure the safety and protection of our customer information. There follows an explanation of our commitment to protecting the privacy of Internet Users.

### Information Collection and Use

Expert Software Applications Srl is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from those which are disclosed in this statement. Expert Software Applications Srl collects information from our users at several different points on our website.

### Forms

We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and address) and possibly financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's order. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the users hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

### Log files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track site use, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

### Links

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we Expert Software Applications Srl are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

### Surveys & Contests

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as country, postal or zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

### Security

This website takes every precaution to protect our users information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, the information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best available encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just surfing. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our user information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
