## Our service

### Data Collected through Our Service

Minimob's Service enables mobile application developers to provide free, ad-supported applications to end users. When you download a mobile application that utilizes our Service, we may collect information from your mobile device in accordance with the permissions you have granted when installing the application. For example, in accordance with the permissions you have granted, we may collect your device ID, device make and model, device IP address, mobile web browser type and version, mobile carrier, real-time location information, email address, phone number and a list of the mobile applications on your device.

### Use of Data We Collect through Our Service

We may use personal information collected through our Service for the purposes described in this Policy, including to:

  * operate and improve our Service;
  * monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with our Service; and
  * deliver personalized advertisements to your mobile device.



We may store and process the information we collect through our Service in the EU.

### Disclosure of Data Collected through Our Service

We may share personal information about you as follows:

  * with third party advertisers who are a part of the Minimob mobile advertising platform for their direct marketing purposes;
  * with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who work on our behalf or with us to provide our Service and need access to your information to carry out their work for us;
  * to (i) comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process, (ii) to protect the rights and property of Minimob our agents, customers, members, and others including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use or (iii) in an emergency to protect the safety of Minimob, its customers or any person;

### Your Information Choices Regarding Our Service

When you download a mobile application from an application developer that is part of our mobile advertising platform, we may begin to collect data from your mobile device and you may receive advertisements on your mobile device. We provide notice of our collection, use and disclosure of your information when you install a mobile application that contains our Service. At any time, you may delete the application that contains our Service, which will prevent us from collecting any information from your mobile device and prevent the delivery of advertisements to your mobile device.

Please see the instructions below for additional information on how you can manage your preferences regarding the delivery of our advertisements.

**Push Notification Ads:** Push Notification Ads are placed in your notification tray alongside other notifications. Each notification advertisement is tagged with the name of the mobile application that is responsible for enabling the advertisement to be delivered to your mobile device as well as a link to our opt-out site, located at http://dashboard.minimob.com/opt-out.asp ("Opt-Out Site"). The Opt-Out Site provides you with two methods to prevent future notification ads from being delivered to your mobile device. First, users can permanently opt-out of receiving any future notification ads from Minimob by installing and running our opt-out application. Second, users can manually enter their IMEI number into our Opt-Out Site to see the individual applications installed on their device that are a part of our mobile advertising platform. Users can then individually delete these applications if they would like to stop receiving our advertisements. Please note, if you choose to manually delete applications rather than install our opt-out application, you may begin to receive our advertisements in the future if you download an application that is part of our mobile advertising platform.

**Icon Ads:** Icon Ads may appear on the home screen of your mobile device. Users can delete Icon Ads with one click. Alternatively, users may follow the opt-out process outlined in the Push Notification Ads section above to prevent future Icon Ads from appearing.

**In-App Ads:** Signup Ads, and certain other forms of in-app advertisements, may be displayed within your mobile applications. Users can click the 'Skip' button to bypass a Signup Ad and proceed to the main app activity. Other in-app advertisements may be ignored or the user can close the application to prevent viewing these advertisements.

Minimob takes reasonable precautions to safeguard the personal information we collect through our Service in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
