# MindMup.com Privacy Policy

MindMup.com is a free online mindmapping service, built on opensource software. It allows users to quickly create mind maps, store them in the cloud and access from anywhere, collaborate and share mindmaps with colleagues and friends. 

This Privacy Policy describes how and when MindMup.com collects, uses and shares your information when you use our services. When you use MindMup.com, you agree to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us at [contact@mindmup.com](mailto:contact@mindmup.com)

## Information collection and use

MindMup.com ("we") is essentially anonymous, but we depend on third parties for core functionality. This section describes how MindMup.com works isolated from third parties. The section Information sharing describes how we share information with third parties.

MindMup.com itself does not collect any private or personal information from our users. We do collect extensive anonymous information about the use of our software, and most of it will be stored in your browser and kept during the browser session (as explained below in the Auto-saving and Troubleshooting sections). 

**Authentication:** MindMup connects to various third party services for storage, such as Google Drive, Dropbox and Github. Those services authenticate you directly, and an authentication token identifying you as the document owner is stored in your local browser session profile. Depending on the third party service requirements, authentication tokens may be kept in memory during authentication on our servers, but no authentication tokens are ever stored on our server. This information is automatically discarded once you close the current browser session.

**Auto-saving:** A detailed log of all your actions on each map you edit, since the last saving action, including the textual contents of the changes to the mind map, is kept in your local browser profile storage (HTML5 localStorage) for auto-saving purposes (it is used to restore your work in case of the session being interrupted due to a software or hardware error or the browser window being closed unintentionally). This content can be deleted by clearing your local browser profile.

**Troubleshooting:** A detailed log of the most recent actions, including the changes to the contents of any mind map, since the most recent opening of a web page on MindMup.com, is kept in memory in your browser session, and automatically submitted when you send feedback or questions using the contact form (see the sharing section below). The in-memory contents are automatically cleared once you close the current browser session or visit another page.

**Cookies:** We use cookies to identify users that previously visited MindMup.com, for the purpose of analytics and selecting relevant news updates to display. You can clear this information by clearing the browser cookies associated with MindMup.com.

**Mind Maps:** We provide anonymous storage for mind maps, [subject to capacity limits](http://blog.mindmup.com/p/storage-options.html). Any content saved to this storage is publicly accessible without any protection, authentication or logging, and physically stored on Amazon's S3 cloud storage. We create maps with a URL that is randomly generated and difficult to guess, but this is not a guarantee of privacy. When you save a map to our anoymous storage, you agree to release that user generated content under the terms of [CC1.0 Universal License](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode). We will retain this information and provide access to it for at least six months since the date of creation. While we will not agressively delete content, we do not guarantee storing it for more than six months and may remove content after that period. We do not provide a way for users to delete any content stored on our public storage, because we do not have any record of who actually created it. (Any content stored on third-party storage services is licensed and retained according to third-party service rules). 

**Mind map identifiers:** A record of the last map you viewed, and all the maps you saved, created or bookmarked, may be stored in your local browser profile, and used to populate the File menu when you next visit MindMup.com. This content can be cleared by clearing the local browser profile.

## Information sharing

We do not store any user data, apart from public mind maps, so we do not share such information with anyone automatically. Third parties we integrate with may store your data or information independently. We listed the third party services we use below:

**Mind Maps on third party storage:** MindMup.com integrates with several third-party storage services, such as Google Drive, Github and Dropbox. When you choose to save a map using one of those services, we will share the map contents with the chosen service. When you work with a map stored on a third party service, your browser directly interacts with those services and the map content never passes through our servers. (with the exception of contact e-mails, as explained below).

**Analytics:** We use analytics extensively for troubleshooting and optimisation purposes, and all user actions on MindMup.com are logged using a third-party service (Google Analytics) along with information to identify the operating system and browser software that Google Analytics typically collects. We send summary information to Google Analytics including the type of action performed, but not the actual textual contents of any changes of changes. (so for example, we will notify Google Analytics that you created a new node, but not what you put into the node).

## Changes to this Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at <http://www.mindmup.com/legal/privacy>. We will notify you about significant updates to this policy at [http://blog.mindmup.com](http://blog.mindmup.com/). By continuing to access or use MindMup.com after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
