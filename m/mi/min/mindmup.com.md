# MindMup Privacy Policy

## MindMup 2 Privacy Policy

`Document updated 8 October 2016`

MindMup 2 for is a free online mindmapping service. It allows users to quickly create mind maps, store them in the cloud and access from anywhere, collaborate and share mindmaps with colleagues and friends.

This Privacy Policy describes how and when MindMup 2 collects, uses and shares your information when you use our services. When you use MindMup 2, you agree to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

If you have any questions about this policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact.html).

## Information collection and use

MindMup 2 (“we”) is essentially anonymous, but we depend on third parties, such as Google Drive and Google Analytics for core functionality. MindMup 2 also allows users to use optional additional MindMup services, such as MindMup Atlas (for anonymous publishing on the internet) and MindMup Gold (for exporting maps into various formats).

This section describes how MindMup 2 works isolated from third parties and optional services. The section Information sharing describes how we share information with third parties. The section Optional services describes how information is used by additional MindMup services.

MindMup 2 itself does not collect any private or personal information from our users.

Authentication: MindMup 2 connects to Google Drive services for storage. That service authenticates you directly, and an authentication token identifying you as the document owner is stored in your local browser session profile. This information is automatically discarded once you close the current browser session.

Cookies: We may use cookies to identify users that previously visited us, for the purpose of analytics and selecting relevant news updates to display. You can clear this information by clearing the browser cookies associated with MindMup.com.

## Information sharing

We do not store any user data, so we do not share such information with anyone automatically. Third parties we integrate with may store your data or information independently. We listed the third party services we use below:

Mind Maps on third party storage: MindMup 2 integrates with Google Drive. When you work with a mind map map stored on Google Drive, your browser directly interacts with that service and the map content never passes through our servers. We use standard Google Drive sharing functionality when you decide to share the map, and standard Google Drive authentication/authorization mechanisms for access control.

Analytics: We use analytics extensively for troubleshooting and optimisation purposes, using a third-party service (Google Analytics). We send anonymous summary information about actions users perform to Google Analytics including the type of action performed, but not the actual textual contents of any changes of changes. (so for example, we may notify Google Analytics that you create a new node, but not what you put into the node).

## Optional/additional services

Publishing Maps: MindMup 2 allows users to publish maps online using MindMup Atlas. We do not share any information about your maps with Atlas without your explicit request to publish the content. When you choose to publish a map to Atlas, MindMup 2 will upload the map contents to Atlas. Any maps published to Atlas are subject to [MindMup Atlas terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/resources/terms_atlas.html).

Exporting Maps: MindMup 2 allows users to export maps into various content formats such as PDF, PNG and Google Writer. We do not share any contents about your maps without your explicit request to convert the map into a different format, and where remote services are required for conversion, we will warn you first about the map being uploaded remotely. Maps are sent to Amazon S3 service for processing, using HTTPS, and the converted format is kept on the Amazon S3 storage for up to 24 hours so you can retrieve and share it, protected by Amazon S3 authorization mechanisms. For more technical information on this, see [Key information about data security](https://web.archive.org/resources/data-security.html).
