To use this website, first complete the registration form and create a user name and password. During registration, you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address).

You have the option to provide demographic information (such as income level, gender and zip code). We encourage you to submit this information since omission of this information may hinder your being eligible to participate in certain surveys.

McMillion Research is the sole owner of the information collected on MindField Online. McMillion Research collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our website.

**Surveys**

We provide you the opportunity to participate in multiple surveys on our site. We may use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys; however, we will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice. For example, if you agree to participate in a product test, we may need to share your personal information such as your name and mailing address with our client in order for the client to send you the product that you will be testing. In these cases you will be notified prior to our sharing the information and you can choose whether to in the product test. We would not allow our clients to use your information for any other purpose other than to send you the product to be tested. For reward purposes, a randomly generated unique identifier will be used for completion tracking.
