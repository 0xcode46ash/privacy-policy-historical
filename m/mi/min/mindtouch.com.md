# Privacy Policy | MindTouch

## Introduction

Thank you for visiting one of MindTouch®, Inc.’s (“MindTouch”) Internet websites. This Privacy Policy details certain policies implemented throughout MindTouch, governing MindTouch’s use of information, including without limitation personally identifiable information, about users on www.mindtouch.com web site (the “Website”) and users of our cloud based services (“Services”).

## EU-US Privacy Shield Framework

MindTouch complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries.  MindTouch has certified that it adheres to the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.  If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles, the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the EU-US Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.

This privacy policy outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, including the types of information we gather, how we use it and the notice and choice affected individuals have regarding our use of and their ability to correct that information. This privacy policy applies to all personal information received by MindTouch whether in electronic, paper or verbal format.

### Definitions

“Personal Information” or “Information” means information that (1) is transferred from the EU to the United States; (2) is recorded in any form; (3) is about, or pertains to a specific individual; and (4) can be linked to that individual.

“Sensitive Personal Information” means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or that concerns an individual’s health.

### Principles

#### Notice

MindTouch shall inform an individual of the purpose for which it collects and uses the Personal Information and the types of non-agent third parties to which the MindTouch discloses or may disclose that Information. MindTouch shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information to MindTouch, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before the MindTouch uses or discloses the Information for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected.

#### Choice

MindTouch will provide an individual opt-out or opt-in choice before we share their Personal Information with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.   If we ever were to engage in any onward transfers of your data with third parties for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized, we would provide you with an opt-out choice to limit the use and disclosure of your personal data.   For Sensitive Personal Information, MindTouch will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively or explicitly (opt out) consent to the disclosure of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. MindTouch shall treat Sensitive Personal Information received from an individual the same as the individual would treat and identify it as Sensitive Personal Information.

You will be notified by email to the email address then on record.  You may can opt-out by emailing webmaster@mindtouch.com, or by following the opt-out instructions in the email or newsletter, or by sending mail to MindTouch, Inc.  (Attn: Legal Department). 101 West Broadway, Suite 1500, San Diego, CA 92101.

#### Accountability for Onward Transfers

Prior to disclosing Personal Information to a third party, MindTouch shall notify the individual of such disclosure and allow the individual the choice (opt out) of such disclosure. We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.  MindTouch shall ensure that any third party for which Personal Information may be disclosed will agree in writing to provide the same level of privacy protection as is describe in this policy. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, MindTouch is potentially liable.

You will be notified by email to the email address then on record.  You may can opt-out by emailing webmaster@mindtouch.com, or by following the opt-out instructions in the email or newsletter, or by sending mail to MindTouch, Inc.  (Attn: Legal Department). 101 West Broadway, Suite 1500, San Diego, CA 92101.

#### Data Security

MindTouch shall take reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. MindTouch has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. MindTouch cannot guarantee the security of Information on or transmitted via the Internet.

#### Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation

MindTouch shall only process Personal Information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, MindTouch shall take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.

#### Right to Access

MindTouch acknowledges that EU individuals have the right to access the personal information that we maintain about them.   MindTouch shall allow an individual access to their Personal Information and allow the individual to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.  An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct his query to [privacy@mindtouch.com](mailto:privacy@mindtouch.com).
