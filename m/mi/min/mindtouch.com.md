## Introduction

This Privacy Policy details certain policies implemented throughout MindTouch that governs MindTouch’s use of information, including—but not limited to—Personal Identifiable Information (PII) about users (the “Individual”) on <https://mindtouch.com/> (the “Website”).

These policies are detailed in the Master Subscription Agreement (MSA). The current version of the Master Subscription Agreement is published here at <https://mindtouch.com/msa>.

Please note that Subscribers to the Services are solely responsible for establishing policies to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations—as well as any and all privacy policies, agreements, or other obligations that relate to the collection of Personal Identifiable Information in connection with the use of the Services by Individuals (also referred to as “data subjects”) with whom the Subscribers interact. If the Individual interacts with a Subscriber using the Services, then the Individual will be directed to contact the Subscriber for assistance with any requests or questions relating to the Individual’s Personal Identifiable Information, or if the Individual wishes to amend how that information is being used.

In order to provide Services, MindTouch may transfer Personal Identifiable Information to companies that help provide Services.
