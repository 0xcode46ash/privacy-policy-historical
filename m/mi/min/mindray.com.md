If you do not want Mindray to use your personal data that has not been provided by you, you may let us know at any time by contacting us at [ privacy@mindray.com](mailto:privacy@mindray.com).

###  Sharing your Personal Data with others

We may share your personal data with service providers, business partners and other third parties, in accordance with applicable law.

For example, Mindray may sell you a product or offer you a service in a joint marketing effort with another company (Business Partner). We will let you know that such a relationship exists and who these companies are prior to processing your data for such joint marketing efforts.

If we are required by law to obtain your consent, or otherwise believe that your consent is appropriate in the circumstances, we will obtain your consent before we share your personal data.

The agreements with these Business Partners will limit the purposes for which your personal data can be used and disclosed, and will require your personal data to be adequately safeguarded.

Mindray will disclose personal data only in conformance with this Privacy Notice and/or when required by law.

From time to time, Mindray may sell a business or a part of a business to another company. Such a transfer of ownership could include the transfer of your personal data directly related to that business to the purchasing company.

###  Your rights

Once you have provided us with your personal data, you have reasonable access to that information so that you can update, modify or, if legally possible, delete it. For My Mindray you may do this by logging into your account and accessing your "personal settings", where you can also change your preferences relating to how Mindray communicates with you. You may also make these requests regarding your personal data by contacting Mindray at [privacy@mindray.com](mailto:privacy@mindray.com)

You will also be provided with an opt-out opportunity when necessary and we will comply with any local legislation.

We encourage you to keep your personal settings and personal data complete and current.

###  Your choices

We want to know you better so we can serve you better while at the same time respecting your choices about how we use your personal data.

Your personal data may be transferred from your home country to other Mindray companies, in different locations around the world, which may communicate with you about Mindray products, services or special offers that you may be interested in. If local law requires it, we will ask for prior consent to transfer your personal data outside of your geographic region.

If you do not want us to send you personalised offers or information, you can let us know by checking the appropriate box on the registration form or reply card, or by selecting "opt-out" on emails you receive.

Where local law requires it, we will ask you to "opt-in" or affirmatively consent to the processing of your personal data. For example, where local law so requires, we will only send you newsletters if you have subscribed to them. Similarly, where local law so requires, we will ask you to "opt-in" before using sophisticated profiling techniques.

Because Mindray sells thousands of products in hundreds of countries, you may have previously provided us with your personal data through reply cards, via our call centres or in some other manner. Your decision not to register now will not affect the personal data you have already provided to Mindray. Of course, you will always have the option to unsubscribe from any targeted communication from Mindray or change your personal profile information.
