# Minted.com: Wedding Invitations, Party Invitations, Baby Shower, Birthday & Save The Date Cards

### Registration

back to top

We do not require registration in order to browse on our site. You may choose to give your contact information during registration. We then may use that information to contact you about the products and services on our site for which you have expressed interest. Registration is required to use certain interactive features such as reviewing products, saving designs, and placing orders. We send all new registered members a welcoming email to verify registration. Then registered members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special sales, and our newsletter. You have the option to opt out from receiving these types of information, and you may unsubscribe at any time by changing the settings in your account profile. Registration allows customers to utilize 'saved design' functionality on the website. Users can customize an unlimited number of stationery items. The text on these saved designs may contain personal information including addresses, contact information or dates of personal events. This information is only available to the registered user and our design associates. The customer also has the ability to 'share their saved designs.' This is available so that a customer can allow other people to view or comment on their saved stationery designs. Minted will provide a link to the invitee to view the saved stationery. Saved designs are not publicly available.

### Information Collected

back to top

We collect personal information when you register with us, and when you use our services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. When you create a member account we ask for information such as your name and email address. When you place an order we ask for a phone number, billing and shipping address, and billing information. We do not intentionally target our site or our services to children, and we will not knowingly collect personal information from children without obtaining prior, verifiable parental consent. We may obtain information about children who are named on invitations or other products, or that is otherwise provided by users. If we are informed that a registered user is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior, verifiable parental consent, then we will endeavor to remove such personal information from our records.

### Use of Information

back to top

We use your personal information to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve our services, to customize the advertising and content you see, and to contact you. We use anonymous information, such as that pertaining to web pages viewed, to analyze trends, to track user's movements, to provide a better website experience and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not use this data in a manner that would identify you personally. Your product reviews, comments and any other information you make available in public areas of our website likely will be seen by people and organizations not related to or controlled by Minted.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

back to top

Minted will not rent, sell, or share your personal information with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services that you have requested, or unless we have your permission as agreed in this Privacy Policy or otherwise. If you submit a different address for shipping than for billing, the shipping information is only used to ship the package. You may specify an email address for the recipient if you wish for us to send them an email notification 'gift message.' The shipping recipient will not be opted in to any marketing distribution lists. We may share personal information with contractors or trusted service providers who work with us under confidentiality agreements, for example our printers and online proof rendering service need this information in order to fulfill your order. We may also contract with vendors to help us analyze traffic and usage of our site, communicate with you about offers and services from Minted, and to help us provide better services. These companies will not be provided any independent right to use or share personal information. We may share personal information in order to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We also may share personal information when we believe it necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information about you if we are acquired by, reorganized or merged with another company. In that event, we will notify active registered users if there is a need to change this Privacy Policy.
