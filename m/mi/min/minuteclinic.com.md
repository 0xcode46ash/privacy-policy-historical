    2. Payment includes the activities necessary to obtain reimbursement for the provision of health care.

If you are unable to agree or object to the use or disclosure, we may disclose such information as necessary if we determine that it is in your best interest.
  * In other situations, your written authorization will be obtained before MinuteClinic will use or disclose your health information to third parties outside MinuteClinic.
  * State and federal laws may be more stringent and may prohibit certain uses and disclosures identified above.
