# Minehut - Free Minecraft Server Hosting

## PRIVACY POLICY

Effective 1/15/19

Minehut is committed to providing a safe and fun experience for its customers, which includes protecting your privacy and data. To enhance the enjoyment and experience of our customers, we collect certain information that can be used on its own, or with other information, for the purposes of direct contact, customer service or providing value-added experiences. This Privacy Policy is intended to give you a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect, and otherwise handle such personally identifiable information. It also describes how you can tell us your preferences regarding our use of such information. We ensure that our Privacy Policy and information collection practices adhere to the laws of the countries in which we do business.

#### What personal information do we collect?

When registering on our website, users must provide their email address, username and their age. These data points are the only information required by our registration process.

Once registered, each user has the option, but is not required, to complete an account profile for free Minecraft server hosting that includes the following additional information: first name, last name, street address, city, state/province/region of residence, and country of residence, phone number, gender and some psychographic inputs. Our website includes, or may include, communications tools such as forms, forums and chat where it may be sometimes possible for users to provide personal information that is visible to other users. When you use our website to purchase items, we may also collect billing information such as a credit card number and billing address.

#### When do we collect information?

We collect information when you register at www.minehut.com, when you complete and submit any of the optional information included in their account profile, when you make purchases, and when you interact with customer support. 

#### How do we use your information?

We use the information you provide us:

  * To determine your age.
  * To respond to inquiries and requests.
  * To process transactions, fulfill orders, and prevent transactional fraud.
  * To send periodic emails.
  * To monitor and improve our site and services, support our internal operations, and for internal analysis.
  * To protect the security and integrity of our site and business.
  * As required by law.
  * In other ways that are standard industry practice and do not conflict with your expectations.



#### How do we protect your information?

We use reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. Our website is scanned on a regular basis to detect and address security vulnerabilities. We regularly scan our site and systems for malware. We maintain personal data information on secured servers only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems and are contractually required to keep the information confidential. Sensitive data is encrypted. We maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal data and information we collect by taking reasonable steps to release such information only to parties capable of maintaining its confidentiality and security (see “Do we share your information?” below). We retain the personal information we collect for only as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which we collected the information. After that, we ensure that the collected personal information is deleted in a manner that safeguards against a security breach and protects against its unauthorized access or use, though it is possible your information may persist as residual copies or in our backup systems for some time after we have directed its deletion. We also use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol on your account information and registration pages to protect sensitive personal information. Financial transactions are processed through a certified back-end provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.

#### Do we use ‘cookies’?

Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow), that enable the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we can use cookies to help us remember you each time you visit our site, rather than requiring you to log in on each visit. They can also be used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We can also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction, so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

We use cookies to understand and save a user’s preferences for future visits. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your Web browser’s settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.

If you disable cookies (turn them off), some features on our website may be disabled, and some of our services may not function properly. However, many site features may also remain available even if you disable cookies.

We do not use cookies or other technologies to track your activities on non-affiliated Minehut sites or services, or to serve advertisements based on your browsing activities on non-affiliated Minehut sites or services.

#### Do we share your information?

We do not sell or otherwise share your information with any third parties, except for the limited purposes described below.

Service Providers: The personal information we collect may be transferred, disclosed, or shared with services engaged by us to support our internal operations (such as payment processing or mail/e-mail distribution), and to perform other technical and processing functions (such as storing data, maintaining data integrity, programming operations, user services or technology services). We may provide these services information we collect as needed to perform their functions, but they are prohibited from using that information for other purposes, and they specifically agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Some of these providers, such as payment processors, may request additional information during the course of offering their services. Before you provide additional information to third party providers, we encourage you to review their privacy policies and information collection practices.

Law Enforcement Safety: We may access, preserve, and/or disclose the information we collect and/or content you and/or your child (when applicable) provides to us (including information posted to our in-site communications tools) to a law enforcement agency or other third parties if required to do so by law or with a good faith belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce Minehut’s Terms of Use or other agreements; (iii) respond to claims that the content violates the rights of third parties; and (iv) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the owners or users of Minehut, a third party, or the general public. We also may disclose information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability; to protect or defend our rights or property; or protect the safety, rights, or property of others. 

#### In-Site Communications Tools:

Our website includes various in-site communications tools (e.g., forums, comments, or chat). Please be aware that anyone may read postings on certain in-site communications tools. Any information which is posted to such in-site communications tools could include personal information, which would be disclosed and available to other users of that tool and would not therefore be private. Minehut cannot guarantee the security of information that any user discloses or communicates online in public areas. Those who do so, do so at their own risk. We reserve the right to monitor the content of our in-site communications tools. If age inappropriate material or potentially identifiable information is seen, it may be removed or edited by us for security, privacy and/or legal reasons. We will not republish postings from our in-site communications tools elsewhere on the Web.

#### Social Media:

Minehut and its staff and other representatives maintain accounts on various social media sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). 

#### Business transfer:

Minehut is wholly-owned by Super League Gaming, Inc. and the personal information we have collected may be transferred to that entity at any time. Additionally, in a bankruptcy or reorganization, such information may be considered an asset and may be transferred or sold.

#### How do I consent to and control your use of my personal information?

We strive to give you access to your personal information, and if that information is wrong, to allow you to update it easily or delete it (unless we’re required to keep that information for legitimate business or legal reasons). Should you wish to access or request deletion of any of the personal information you have provided us, please contact us at:
    
    
            Minehut
            2906 Colorado Ave.
            Santa Monica, CA 90404 USA
            support@minehut.com
        

We may reject requests for access or deletion of personal information if they are unreasonably repetitive, require unreasonable technical measures (such as changing our business practices or developing new functionality), put others’ privacy at risk, or would be unreasonably impractical. We will not charge you for accessing or correcting your personal information except if doing so would require unreasonable expense to us. Though we will do our best to honor your request to delete data, it is possible your information may persist as residual copies or in our backup systems for some time after we have received and acted upon your request.

#### Our commitment to children’s privacy:

Protecting the privacy of children is of paramount importance to us. We understand that users who are under 13 years of age need special safeguards and privacy protection. It is our intent to fully comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

#### Linking to and embedding from third party sites or services:

From time to time we may link to or embed content from non-affiliated Minehut sites or services on our Minehut website. In addition, the foregoing, may include the content or services provided by Super League Gaming, Inc. All third-party sites or services have separate and independent privacy policies and terms of use. We have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of sites or services to which we may link, or from which we may embed, excluding Super League Gaming, Inc. with which we are affiliated. Except as set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we do not share information with such sites or services. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site, and welcome any feedback or concern about sites or services to which we link or from which we embed.
