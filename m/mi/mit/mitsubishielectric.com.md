# Mitsubishi Electric US Companies

Mitsubishi Electric & Electronics USA, Inc. ("MEUS") is sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet. This policy explains how MEUS treats the information about you that we receive on the Internet. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you, as a visitor to our Web site (the "Site"), what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit this Site, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. Please note that this policy applies only to our Site, and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to which we link.

In general, you can visit this Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our service automatically gathers certain usage information such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Site. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Site and how much of the Site you use, so that we can improve our Site. MEUS uses a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in the Site are visited, and by how many people. MEUS cookies do not collect personally identifiable information, and MEUS does not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what your screen name or e-mail address is.

There are times, however, when we may need information from you: when you register to use our customer and/or vendor specific services or when you order a product. In those cases, we will need certain information \-- such as name, Internet address or screen name, billing address, credit card number -- in order to provide that service or product to you. MEUS may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be interested. You can choose not to receive such information if you do not want to by letting MEUS know on the registration screen when you sign up for the product or service or by separately contacting the Webmaster.

MEUS does not use or disclose information about your individual visits to the Site or information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any outside companies.

At times MEUS may conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs and profile of our visitors. When we conduct a survey, we will try to let you know how we will use the information collected from you.

The Site may contain links to other sites. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
