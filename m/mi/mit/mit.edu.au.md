##  National Privacy Principles

MIT is bound by the national Privacy Principles (NPPs) in schedule 3 of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (see [www.comlaw.gov.au](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/)).

##  Collection of information

MIT collects information for the primary purpose of providing higher education services in accordance with the law and our obligations to you, which includes the purposes of providing and administering approved courses, internal planning, student services (including welfare programs), student relations (including alumni), compliance with reporting requirements and administration of government programs such as the Higher Education Loan Program and the promotion of MIT.

MIT collects information by lawful and fair means, which are not unreasonably intrusive. MIT collects information that is necessary to perform its functions and activities or to comply with the law. This information typically includes your name, age, gender, place of birth, nationality, contact details in Australia and other prescribed details; information about your course, financial arrangements and payments in relation to the course, health insurance, English language proficiency, passport, student visa, breach or suspected breach of visa conditions and academic progress and performance; and information that MIT is obliged by law to collect or report.

Where it is reasonable and practicable to do so, MIT collects information about you directly from you. Otherwise, MIT will take reasonable steps to let you know, generally, what personal information it holds. MIT will seek your consent before collecting sensitive information unless collection is otherwise authorized or required by law.

##  Use and disclosure of information

MIT will use or disclose personal information for the primary purpose for which it was collected, for any related secondary purpose that you would reasonably expect, or with your consent. MIT may disclose personal information (other than sensitive information) for the purpose of direct marketing in accordance with NPPs. MIT will only disclose health information in accordance with the NPPs.

Typically, MIT discloses personal information for legitimate purposes such as the following:

  * acquiring products and services which you authorize us to purchase for you, such as overseas student health care;
  * offering and providing student support services (such as welfare related services, emergency and health services and complaints and appeals processes);
  * publishing examination and assessment results;
  * releasing academic details to another tertiary institution or tertiary admission centre if you apply to transfer studies;
  * protecting a student or someone else from a serious and imminent threat to their life or health;
  * disclosure that is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or for the protection of the public revenue.



MIT may also use and disclose information where required or authorized by or under law (meaning any Commonwealth, State or Territory law or the common law) or the NPPs. For example, MIT may be required to disclose personal information about you to the Australian government and designated authorities (such as the TPS Director) if: you become an accepted student; you do not begin a course when expected; you withdraw from the course (before or after the agreed starting day); your studies are terminated before the completion of your course, whether as a result of action by MIT or you (including because you fail to pay an amount you are liable to pay MIT, breach a condition of your visa or misbehaviour); you breach a prescribed condition of your student visa; or the identity or duration of your course changes.

MIT may disclose personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy to third parties as necessary, such as to a provider with whom we provide (or intend to provide or have provided) a course to you; an education agent; a person or body who sponsors you (if any); or any person entitled to the information.

##  Protection of information

MIT holds information in electronic and hardcopy form. MIT takes reasonable precautions to ensure that information is stored securely and protected from misuse, loss, unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. MIT may hold information about you while you are a student, and before and after you are a student. Where information is no longer needed, MIT either destroys records containing personal information by reasonably secure means or de-identifies the personal information.

##  Data quality

MIT takes reasonable steps to confirm the accuracy of information it holds about you. From time to time, MIT asks for updated information. MIT is not obliged to update information it holds about you after you have ceased your studies.

##  Access to information

You may request access to information that MIT holds about you by lodging a written request with MIT. MIT may permit either inspection, note taking, copying or provide a print out of information, as it considers appropriate. In limited circumstances MIT may refuse you access (see MIT’s Terms and Conditions of Enrolment, Fee Payment and Refund Policy and NPPs). In those cases, you will be notified of the reason MIT is relying on to refuse access.

##  Queries or concerns

Questions or concerns about the privacy of information we hold about you may be directed to [admin@mit.edu.au](mailto:admin@mit.edu.au). Complaints may also be directed to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner if you think that MIT has interfered with your privacy.
