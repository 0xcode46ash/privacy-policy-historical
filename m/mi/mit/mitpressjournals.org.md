# MIT Press Journals - Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

#### Overview

Your privacy is important to The MIT Press, and we are committed to respecting that privacy. This statement describes the personal information practices for the MIT Press Journals Website, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared.

#### Personal Information

In general, you can visit the MIT Press Journals Website without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information.

In using specific features of the site, such as the online commerce functionality, you will be asked to give us personal information that will be needed to (for example) correspond with you, process an order, or provide you with a subscription. Aside from aggregating data, with all personal information removed, to allow us to check on our own performance, it is our intent that your personal information will be used only to fulfill the request(s) you make of us, and to allow us to contact you if there are any problems with your request. We will not exchange or sell your email address to third parties.

#### Information Security and Quality

We intend to protect the integrity of your personal information. To do this, we have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for transmission of credit card numbers and passwords, to help us keep your information secure, accurate, current, and complete. For security reasons, please do not email your credit card information. We will make a sincere effort to respond in a timely manner to your requests to correct inaccuracies in your personal information, to remove personal information you do not want stored, or to answer any questions you may have about our use of your information.

#### Information Gathered through Cookies and Other Technologies

In general, you can use the MIT Press Journals Website in all ways without using the technology known as "cookies." A cookie is a short identifier, stored on your computer, which a site may use to identify you when you make return visits to it. The features of The MIT Press sites were designed to work without cookies, so if you turn them off, you may still browse, search, and shop at our site. Performance may be slower, however, and the "Remember Me" feature (for registered site users) will not function.

We may collect information from visits to The MIT Press sites to help us provide better customer service and a better customer experience. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we measure aggregate user activity on the MIT Press Journals Website, but we do so in ways that keep user's personal identity and information anonymous. The Press or the analytic vendors it selects may use this data to analyze site usage trends and statistics, to help us improve our site.

When we collect personal data from you in connection with a transaction (an order, e-mail request, etc.) we may extract some information about that transaction in an anonymous format and combine it with other anonymous information such as clickstream data. This anonymous information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns in our site's usage.

#### Business Relationships

The MIT Press Journals Website may contain links to other websites. The Press is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these websites.
