## Mitsubishi Electric US, Inc., Cooling & Heating Division, Privacy Policy

### PRIVACY POLICY | PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!

 **PRIVACY POLICY**

Mitsubishi Electric US, Inc. ("MEUS") is sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you, as a visitor to our Web site (the "Site"), what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit this Site, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. Please note that this policy applies only to our Site, and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to which we link. Please consult the privacy policy of any such third party sites for details.

Cookies/Re-Targeting Codes. To improve the content we are providing and the user experience on the Site, we automatically gather certain usage information such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Site, the amount of time spent on the Site, and general web browsing behavior. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Site, and how much of the Site you use. MEUS uses cookies and codes that tell us how and when pages in the Site are visited, by how many people, and how those people interact with the Site. MEUS may use these codes to re-market to users who visit our Site. These cookies and codes do not collect personally identifiable information, and MEUS does not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information.

Google Analytics. We are committed to ensuring that the Site contains content that is valuable and useful to our customers and potential customers who visit. To assist us in this, we have implemented the Google Analytics demographics and interest reporting features on the Site. Google Analytics is a widely-used service that generates detailed statistics about a website's traffic and traffic sources and measures conversions and sales. These tools allow us to review anonymous data regarding the gender, age and interests of website visitors and adapt our website content to better reflect their needs. Although this information is collected through your Google ad settings, it is not provided to us in a personally-identifiable format. This means we cannot identify details about you, and we will not try to figure it out. You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Google Ad [settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads "Visit Google Ad settings to change your preferences.") or through the [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout "Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on download page.")

Invoca Technology. MEUS also uses call automation marketing technology that allows us to assign unique phone numbers across our website (the Site) and track users that call those unique phone numbers for sales and marketing purposes.

ThingLink Technology. MEUS also uses hot spot technology which allows us to insert hot spots on web images, web videos, case studies online, web articles, and any form of web content.

Live Chat. MEUS also uses a live chat box which allows users to interact with MEUS and/or our assigned agents for customer service purposes. The live chat has features that allow MEUS to track chats and optional features that allow users to identify themselves.

Geo-Targeting/IP Locator. The Site also makes use of software that detects what region of the United States users are visiting from in order to provide users with information and resources specific to their particular states and/or geographical areas.

Your Information. There are times when we may need information from you: when you register to use our customer- and/or vendor-specific services or when you order a product. In those cases, we will need certain information -- such as name, phone number, address, Internet address or screen name, billing address, credit card number -- in order to provide services or products to you. MEUS may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be interested. You can choose not to receive such information, if you do not want to by opting-out on the registration screen when you sign up for the product or service or by separately contacting us via email Opt-out at [opt-out@hvac.mea.com.](mailto:opt-out@hvac.mea.com%20 "Opt-out of receiving information from MEUS.")

Third Parties. Please be aware that information you share with MEUS via the Site will be collected, stored, and shared with third parties working on behalf of MEUS, including but not limited to MEUS contractors, distributors, advertising agencies, call centers, and technology companies to better enhance consumer experience and for sales-marketing-research purposes. Additionally, if you choose to have a dealer contact you, your contact information may be forwarded to authorized dealers in your area. If you do not wish to have your information shared with third parties, do not provide MEUS with your information.

At times MEUS may conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs and profile of our visitors. When we conduct a survey, we will inform you how we will use the information collected from you.

The Site may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites. Please review the policies of those third party sites for details.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
