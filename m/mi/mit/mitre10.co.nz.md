## Mitre 10 Privacy Statement Summary

#### Privacy statement

Mitre 10 (New Zealand) Limited values and respects your privacy. In fact we’re a leader in this field being one of the very first retail organisations in New Zealand to hold Data Warranty Register (DWR) Certification issued by the NZ Marketing Association.

The DWR was developed by the NZ Marketing Association to provide consumers with the confidence that organisations, like Mitre 10 (New Zealand) Limited, carrying the DWR Trustmark will treat personal information with absolute respect and privacy, in accordance not only with New Zealand law but also to industry best practice standards (which often exceeds the requirements under the law).

###  **About this privacy statement**

It details how Mitre 10 (New Zealand) Limited collects, uses, and shares the information we collect from our customers. This helps to improve the overall shopping experience and to provide relevant information about Mitre 10 (New Zealand) Limited products, services, and promotions.

Your local Mitre 10 store is operated by the local Mitre 10 Member who may also collect information. In such situations this information is only accessible to that store and in such instances will be subject to that store’s own Privacy Statement.
