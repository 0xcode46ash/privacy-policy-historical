# Privacy - Mitre 10

## We're Good At Keeping Secrets ...

We’ve been online since 2001 and we haven’t given away one secret yet.

We are committed to keeping all of your personal information confidential. We will not rent, sell or give away to any third party your name, address, email address, credit card information or any other personal information unless you ask us to.

Your credit card information is so safe we can’t even see it! It’s processed very securely through to your bank using 128 bit SSL encryption. 

We are bound by New Zealand laws. So mitre10.co.nz may be required by legal process to identify any individual who might attempt to use this site for fraudulent or criminal activities.

## Personal Information - Registered Users

Any personal information, for example likes and dislikes, that you share with mitre10.co.nz is used to provide you with content or offers tailored around your interests; to enable you to make purchases and have them delivered, and also to help us make improvements on our site.

If you have registered on our website, you can update your personal information at any time by logging into your account [here](https://web.archive.org/account/login/).

## Personal Information - Filling In Forms

Any personal information you give us on a form for an event booking, quote or store enquiry will be sent to the store you have selected. Your email address or cellphone number will only be used to contact you about your specific enquiry - unless you have also opted in to one of our newsletter groups. Your personal details will be deleted once your enquiry has been completed and you no longer require a customer service follow up.

## Statistics

We may share non-personal, non-individual statistical or demographic information in aggregate form with our marketing partners.

Mitre 10 uses Google Analytics to better understand the behaviour of visitors to our website. For example, it helps us to identify how many users visit a particular page, and how many take a further step, such as purchasing a product. We also collect anonymous demographic data such as gender and age to help us understand our online visitors , improve our site, and deliver more relevant information as a result.

When you purchase from mitre10.co.nz we will contact you via email to confirm delivery. We may also contact you via email or phone if we experience any problems with processing your order, or if you win a prize in one of our competitions.
