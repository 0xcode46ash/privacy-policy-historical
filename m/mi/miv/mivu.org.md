We provide a variety of information, features, and functions (the “Services”) through these websites.  
This page does not necessarily reflect the ways in which we collect and use information by means other than these websites.  If you have questions about the ways in which we collect information by other means, please contact us using the contact information in this statement. The practices relating to persons with separate agreements with _MVU_ or its affiliates are separately covered in those agreements.

**Information _MVU_ collects**  
The information we collect will depend upon what you do when visiting our sites. EXCEPT AS STATED IN THIS STATEMENT, WE WILL NOT COLLECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU VISIT OUR SITES UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO PROVIDE SUCH INFORMATION TO US. You are free to visit our sites without providing personally identifiable information. However, if you would like to access our Services, in some cases you must first register or create an account or learning profile with _MVU_. When you register or create an account or learning profile, we will request certain personal information. Requests can include, but are not limited to, your name, address, city, state, zip code, county, email address, age, home or other contact information, school contact information, gender, and parent/guardian contact information. In some cases, the sponsoring party funding your participation in the course (a "Sponsoring Party") may provide this or other information about you to us. We may use this information to create an account or learning profile and issue you an access ID and password. If you are paying with a credit card, we also will collect your credit card number (employing industry standard security and encryption technologies), billing information and email address to process your payment.

Personal information better enables us to provide you with content relevant to your interests and provides us with aggregate demographic data that _MVU_ uses to improve the services offered to users. Users may change their personal information at any time by using the provided interface once they are logged in and as often as necessary. If users are unable to log in and change their information themselves, they will be able to send an email to **[customercare@mivu.org](mailto:customercare@mivu.org)** or contact us at the telephone number or address below for assistance.

In addition to registration, _MVU_ may, from time to time, request personal information for purposes such as the provision of customer service, billing, network management, customer surveys, newsletter subscriptions, offers of related services, and other exchanges of information. Users may opt out of receiving future promotional mailings at any time. Please see below for User Options - Opt Out.

_MVU_ gathers information about all users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users’ access most often. _MVU_ automatically logs IP addresses, session sources, and other data which tracks users' access to our sites. We analyze these logs for sales and marketing purposes as well as system performance monitoring. These logs are analyzed for the overall, aggregate trends they reveal about our customers, not for the behaviors of individual users.

**Privacy of children**  
The _MVU_ policy is to limit the collection of personal information from children in substantial agreement with the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA). Children ages 12 and under will not knowingly be allowed to register with _MVU_ or create an account without their parent's permission. Before children ages 12 and under may participate in any Services requiring registration (e.g., creating or enrolling in a course, chat rooms, message boards or other forums), the child's school must first obtain the parent's permission and that permission may allow us to collect and maintain the child’s information. If, at any time after a parent gives permission, the parent desires to review the child's personal information, request that it be deleted, or refuse to allow any further collection of the child's information, the parent may contact the school's representative for _MVU_ or _MVU_ with such a request. If you have additional questions regarding your child's use of his or her account, you may contact the school's representative or _MVU_. Please see below for our contact information.

_MVU_ abides by COPPA and the regulations under it. You can obtain more information about COPPA from the [**Federal Trade Commission**](http://business.ftc.gov/documents/Complying-with-COPPA-Frequently-Asked-Questions).

**What _MVU_ does with the information it collects**  
The User ID you select during registration must be used to log in and participate in a Service or course. Once you log in to our Blackboard® site, you may be identified to the instructor and other students in that course by your full name in areas such as discussion forums, email lists, web conferences, and other places where participant names appear. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes available to the instructor and other students in that course. Blackboard has a user accessible directory feature. Anyone with a Blackboard account can choose to share their Blackboard profile information in this directory. You can turn on or off this feature once logged into Blackboard. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

_MVU_ hosts, or provides links to, chat rooms, forums and message boards. Our online instructors, instructor services, and student services staff monitor and respond to user email sent to them and monitor and participate with users in threaded discussions and other online forums. _MVU_ may monitor or edit the contents of a user's email or threaded discussions or other online forums as required for normal maintenance of any of our websites or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on _MVU_ ; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of _MVU_ ; or (3) act to protect the personal safety of our guests or the public.

If you are a **_Michigan Virtual School®_** student, your grades in **_MVS_** ® courses will be reported to your mentor and your school and/or sponsoring institution. Except as described further in this statement, _the personal information you supply to_ MVU _will not be given, sold, rented, loaned, or otherwise disclosed to any third parties outside of_ MVU _, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with legal process, (ii) enforce the Terms of Use, (iii) respond to claims that any content on our sites violates the rights of third parties, or (iv) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of_ MVU _, its users, or the public._

_MVU_ may use aggregated personal information to determine the demographics of our users and to distribute statistics and general marketplace information about _MVU_. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that these demographics do not identify any specific user.

_On occasion, the MVS may engage **educational researchers** to conduct a study on the school's behalf to improve instruction and services for students. Any individual student information collected or analyzed in a research study will be protected to the maximum extent required by law and no individual names will be used in any reports or publications._

_MVU_ will abide by the **student privacy guidelines**  set forth by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The following persons have access to student records:

  * _MVU_  Board of Directors members
  * President and CEO, the _MVU_ administrative team, and professional staff of  _MVU_
  * Appropriate administrative support staff members and other professionals who have a legitimate educational or legal interest in student records as designated by the President and CEO.

_MVU_  websites are designed to provide you with the information and services you expect; web pages that are accessible, easy-to-use, error-free, and provide appropriate security. To achieve this goal, we've developed our site in accordance with widely-accepted web standards.

If our pages do not function correctly or appear broken, you may have JavaScript turned off, or you may be using a web browser that is not compatible with the security or development standards of this site. Most _MVU_ websites and web applications use JavaScript and require that you allow JavaScript in your web browser in order for them to function correctly.

**Log files**  
We or our hosting provider may collect traffic information from visitors for statistical analysis and site improvement.

IP addresses and other log file information are not linked to personally identifiable information. We do not try to track users or to identify users individually, but we or our hosting providers do review this information to understand overall trends and to determine what kinds of content are popular and useful to users.

In such cases, we will use good faith efforts to restrict the information provided to that which is necessary for the provision of such services.

**Response times**  
We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make timely changes you may request regarding your personal information. Many such changes are accomplished using batch processing (i.e., collecting a number of similar change requests and making all such changes at once), so the changes may not be immediately effective.
