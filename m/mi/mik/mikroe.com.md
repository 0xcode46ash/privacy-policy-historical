Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. 



If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.

## Cookies and Other Technologies

MikroElektronika website, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use "cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

MikroElektronika uses cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.

MikroElektronika also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with MikroElektronika more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the MikroElektronika Online Store. Knowing your country and language - and if you are an educator, your school - helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information helps us provide you with better customer service.

If you want to disable cookies please note that certain features of the MikroElektronika website will not be available once cookies are disabled.

As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. MikroElektronika may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.

In some of our email messages, we use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the MikroElektronika website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.

## Disclosure to Third Parties

When you purchase a MikroElektronika product, you authorize MikroElektronika to exchange the information you provide during the purchase process to carry out service (such as delivery couriers). Personal information will only be shared by MikroElektronika to provide (or improve) our products, services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. Even though we constantly undertake all necessary actions to protect your personal information when transferred to third parties as described below, we are not responsible for any breach of privacy policies made by those third parties.

### Service Providers

MikroElektronika shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys.

In any event, if your personal information is transferred outside of your residence country, such transfer of information will be executed in accordance with the law.

### Other disclosure of information

It may be necessary - by laws, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence - for MikroElektronika to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.

We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.

Finally, you may always withdraw your consent for our processing and use of your personal information, in written or electronic form to the address provided below in item 8. of this Privacy Policy, in which case, we shall be entitled to claim potential losses pursuant to relevant laws.

## Protection of Personal Information

MikroElektronika takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

MikroElektronika online services such as the MikroElektronika Online Store use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is collected. To make purchases from these services, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Safari, Firefox, or Internet Explorer. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal information while it’s transmitted over the Internet.

When you use some MikroElektronika products, services, or applications or post on a MikroElektronika forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.

## Integrity and Retention of Personal Information

MikroElektronika makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by Law.
