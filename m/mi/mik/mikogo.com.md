### Data Protection

Your right to confidential treatment of your data and the requirements of the laws on the protection of personal data are regarded as a strict obligation at BeamYourScreen, which places all employees concerned with the processing of personal data under an obligation to maintain data secrecy pursuant to section 5 of the German Federal Data Protection Act [BDSG].

### Visitor Data

When visiting a BeamYourScreen page, the user’s computer IP address, browser and operating system, our visited page and pages previously visited on that computer, date and time, data volume sent, and technical status information are automatically recorded, saved, and made anonymous (“visitor data”). A personal user profile is not created.  
Data is only collected for statistical purposes to improve the performance and user-friendliness of our website and products, as well as to increase the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising efforts. One of the tools we use for this analysis is Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). It uses small text files, or “cookies,” that save your visitor data onto your computer when you visit our website. These cookies are automatically sent for analysis to Google Inc.’s server in the U.S.A. and are saved there. Google then creates reports on the use of BeamYourScreen pages for BeamYourScreen. Google will never use your IP address to collect any other known data that falls under this category. BeamYourScreen also uses cookies during user account login to accelerate technical processes.
