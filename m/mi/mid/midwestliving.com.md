> 
> Since 1902, Meredith Corporation has focused on providing our customers with products and services that distinguish themselves on the basis of quality, customer service and value. Our Online Privacy Policies are designed to help us serve our customers while meeting their privacy expectations.
> 
> We are a member of the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) and Magazine Publishers of America (MPA) and support self-regulation by these industry associations. We believe this is the best way to maintain good customer service while addressing the privacy concerns of our customers. Also, we actively participate in the DMA Privacy Committee, the DMA Ethics Operating Committee, and the MPA New Media Committee. 
> 
> Additionally, we fully support and use the DMA Mail and Telephone Preference Services through which individuals may restrict the release of their names for marketing purposes.
> 
> When you register with our sites, enter contests or purchase items online, you may request that we remove your name from our marketing lists by sending an email message indicating your wish to restrict offers made to you. We are in the process of providing an opt-out feature near those areas where visitors supply individual information. 
> 
> Our Web sites automatically recognize some information about our visitors, including the company that provides their internet service. Our sites do not automatically recognize the name, address, e-mail address or similar information specific to an individual. Such identifying information is recorded only if you supply it to us via an e-mail, bulletin board message, or online form. Our "cookie" technology allows us to record how many times you visit our site and it helps us manage content. This information allows us to better serve visitors to the site and is not rented or sold to any other company.

> 
> If you contact us to order product, comment or request information and provide us with your postal mailing address, you’ll be added to our database to receive future mailings.
> 
> Meredith occasionally makes the lists of postal addresses volunteered on its Web site available to other carefully screened associations or companies whose products or services we think you may find of interest. We pre-screen all use of our information to avoid inappropriate use for our customers.
> 
> If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please copy your mailing label address exactly (or clip it out) and send your request to our Circulation Department at 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, IA 50309-3023. Or you may contact us via email ([mercirc@mdp.com](mailto:mercirc@mdp.com)).
