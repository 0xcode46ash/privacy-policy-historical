# Privacy Statement - MidFirst Bank

CUSTOMER INFORMATION DISCLOSURE

This disclosure provides information about the collection, use and security of consumers' nonpublic personal information by MidFirst Bank ("we"). This disclosure applies to you if we provide one or more products or services to you to be used primarily for personal, family or household purposes. The information practices described in this disclosure do not apply to (1) products or services used for business purposes or (2) mortgage loans serviced by our affiliate Midland Mortgage Co.

We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:

Our "affiliates" are businesses that are related to us by common ownership or control. As permitted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other applicable law, we may disclose to our affiliates information about you that relates to our own transactions and experiences with you and information that is not a "consumer report" as defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Other than as described in this disclosure or as otherwise permitted or required by law, we do not disclose your nonpublic personal information to our affiliates. If at any time we desire to share information about you with our affiliates other than as described above or as otherwise permitted by law, we will give you notice and the opportunity to limit, or "opt out" of, the information sharing.

"Nonaffiliated third parties" are other companies or individuals that are not related to us by common ownership or control. In order to provide you with the products and services you have requested, we may disclose certain information about you to nonaffiliated third parties that perform activities on our behalf to service your account or in connection with your request for a new MidFirst product or service, including but not limited to companies that perform check printing services, data processing services, real estate appraisal and title insurance services. Additionally, we may disclose information about you to nonaffiliated firms that assist us in marketing our own products. We may also disclose information about you to nonaffiliated financial institution partners to offer jointly endorsed financial products or services, such as credit cards and investment products and services. We reserve the right to disclose your information in these and other circumstances as allowed or required by law. Other than as described in this disclosure or as otherwise authorized or required by law, we do not disclose your nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. If at any time we desire to share information about you with nonaffiliated third parties other than as described above or as otherwise permitted by law, we will first give you notice and the opportunity to limit, or "opt out" of, the information sharing. 

We maintain procedures whereby companies that receive your nonpublic personal information from us are required to maintain it in a secure manner and use it only for the purpose for which it was provided. 

Our employees are trained regarding the importance of customer financial privacy and proper handling of confidential information. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to reasonably guard your nonpublic personal information. Additionally, we restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who have a business reason for accessing that information.

_If you close your account(s) or become an inactive customer, we will adhere to the information practices as described in this notice._
