There are two types of information you may be asked to provide during your visit to our website. As a browser, your email address may be captured. As an online banking customer, transactions processed are collected.

In both cases, your privacy maintains its importance. MIDFLORIDA employees may use this information in order to offer you a product or service that may be of interest to you or to perform their job more efficiently. However, strict policies mandate that any information received will remain with MIDFLORIDA and will not be shared with any other business for any purpose unless written permission has been given by the customer.

We also would like to remind our members that even though your information is private in the hands of MIDFLORIDA, to please use caution when providing personal or financial information to other companies and web sites.
