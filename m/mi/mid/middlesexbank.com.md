**Consumer Privacy Policy Notice**

At Middlesex Savings Bank and our affiliated companies, we value and respect the trust placed in us by our customers. For this reason, we want you to know how we deal with customer information and privacy. 

**Information We Collect:**

We collect, use, and retain information about you only where we reasonably believe that it will help administer our business or provide valuable products, services, and other opportunities to you. We collect and retain information about you only for specific business purposes. We use information to administer your records, accounts, and funds; to comply with certain laws and regulations; to protect your accounts from fraud and misuse; and to understand your financial needs so that we can provide you with quality products and superior service. 

We collect personal and financial information about you from the following sources: 

  * Information we receive from you on applications and other forms (such as your name, address, social security number, assets, liabilities and income) 
  * Information about your transactions with us (such as your account balance, payment history, and parties to transactions) 
  * Information we receive from consumer reporting agencies (such as your credit history and creditworthiness) 



**Disclosure of Information:**

We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law. It is our policy not to reveal specific information about customer accounts or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use. We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to nonaffiliated third parties that perform administrative, processing and other account services, to companies that market financial products and services on our behalf, and as otherwise required or permitted by law. The Bank and its affiliated companies are permitted under law to share with each other information about our experiences or transactions with you or your account (such as your account balance and your payment history with us). 

We also may share additional information about you or your account (such as information we receive from you in applications and information from credit reporting agencies) with our affiliates. You may direct us not to disclose information between the Bank and our affiliates that does not relate solely to experiences or transactions with you or your account (such as application information and credit bureau information) by writing to us at P.O. Box 358, Natick, MA, 01760 or by calling us at 1-877-INFO CTR (1-877-463-6287). If you make such a request, it will apply to all of your consumer relationships within the Middlesex Savings Bank family of affiliated companies. 

**You do not need to notify us more than once if you have multiple accounts, or if you have previously notified us.**

If you have a joint account, a request by one party will apply to the entire account. Your request will be processed within four weeks of receipt. You may still receive offers with your account statements, when you visit or contact us in connection with the maintenance and servicing of your account. 

**Business Relationships With Third Parties:**

When the Bank and our affiliates conduct business with vendors and suppliers, we require those vendors to maintain similar standards of conduct regarding the privacy of customer information that is provided to them. 

**Protection and Confidentiality of Information:**

Middlesex Savings Bank and our affiliated companies are committed to the security of your information. All of our operational and data processing systems are located in secure environments that protect your information from being accessed by unauthorized third parties. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with regulatory standards to protect your information. 

**Maintenance of Account Information:**

We continually strive to maintain complete and accurate information about you and your accounts. If you believe that our records contain inaccurate or incomplete information about you, please notify us. We will investigate your concerns and correct any inaccuracies as quickly as possible. 

**Limitations on Employee Access:**

Access to customer information is limited to employees with a business reason to know such information. Employees are educated on the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of customer information. All Bank and affiliate employees are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of customer information. Any employee who violates these principles is subject to disciplinary action.>
