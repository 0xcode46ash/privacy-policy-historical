**Your Privacy**  
As a customer of Midwest Airlines Web site, we recognize the importance of protecting information. We will ensure that our relationship is as exclusive as you want it to be. 

The following are guidelines we use for protecting the information you provide during a visit to midwestairlines.com.

We collect personal information online to provide you with a personalized web experience. Using the information provided by you, we can deliver you pertinent information and specials each time you visit midwestairlines.com.

Throughout different sections of our Web site you will find different links to provide you greater service and useful resources. These links will lead to sites operated by different privacy practices. We want to caution you that it is your responsibility to access the other sites’ privacy policies, for we have no control over the information that is submitted to these other sites.

**Information Collection and Use**  
Midwest Airlines is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Midwest Airlines collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 

**Profile**  
While a profile is not required to purchase a flight on our Web site, having a profile does provide you with additional benefits. With a profile, you have the option of holding a reservation for up to 72 hours. You can also view your held or purchased itinerary at midwestairlines.com. A profile stores your personal preferences, which speeds up the booking process. In addition, you can purchase Best Care Web Fare specials. Again, these benefits are only available if you have a profile.

While building a profile, users are required to give their contact information, name, e-mail, user ID, password and security question. This information is used to speed up and simplify the online reservation process. It is optional for the user to provide information on preferences, but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.

We may also retain your flight information and ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products and contact preferences.

**E-mail:**  
In order to sign up for e-mail notification, we will request your name and e-mail address in order to subscribe you to Fare Sale Information, Midwest Miles account information, Best Care Web Fares, Midwest Airlines What's New and Other Promotions. With your permission we will send you information about these services or offers that we feel may be of interest to you according to what you have told us about your preferences.  
> Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

**Forward-to-a-Friend**  
Our e-mails contain a section titled “Forward-to-a-Friend.” If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them to provide the e-mail address. We do not store those e-mail addresses. Once someone receives the Forward-to-a-Friend e-mail, they have the option of subscribing to our promotions by clicking on a link within the e-mail. Only then will we retain their information for e-mail notification purposes. 

**Partners**  
We only share your information with our Midwest Miles partners if it is required to provide the product or service you requested or for specific promotional use. In working with our program partners, we require strict contractual obligations that ensure safeguards for the privacy of information we share. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to purchase a flight or view Midwest Miles account activity. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

**Links**  
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Midwest Airlines is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**How can I access or correct my information**  
You can access your personal profile to make changes by clicking at any time the [“Manage Personal Profile”](https://web.archive.org/web/20040603100028id_/http%3A//www.midwestairlines.com/personalize/default.asp) button in the upper right hand corner of the site.
