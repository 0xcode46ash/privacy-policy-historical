# Privacy and Security Statement - Midwest Airlines

### Your Privacy

We recognize the importance of protecting your information and we will ensure that our relationship is as exclusive as you want it to be. The following are guidelines we use for protecting the information you provide during a visit to _midwestairlines.com_.

We collect personal information online to provide you with a personalized Web experience. Using the information provided by you, we can deliver pertinent information and specials each time you visit _midwestairlines.com_.

### Information Collection and Use

Midwest Airlines is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

### Profile/Midwest Miles Account

While a profile is not required to purchase a flight on our Web site, having a profile does provide you with additional benefits. With a profile, you have the option of holding a reservation for up to 24 hours. You can also view your held or purchased itinerary at midwestairlines.com. A profile stores your personal preferences, which speeds the booking process. In addition, occasionally, you'll receive exclusive offers sent to profile members. Again, these benefits are only available if you have a profile.

While building a profile, users are required to give their contact information, name, e-mail, user ID, password and security question. This information is used to speed and simplify the online reservation process. It is optional for the user to provide information on preferences, but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.

We may also retain your flight information and ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products and contact preferences.

### E-mail:

You will need to provide your name and e-mail address to subscribe you to e-mail notification services including Fare Sale Information, Midwest Miles account information, Midwest Airlines What's New and Other Promotions. With your permission, we will send you information about services or offers that we feel may be of interest to you based on what you have told us about your preferences. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

### Partners

We only share your information with our Midwest Miles partners if it is required to provide the product or service you requested or for specific promotional use. In working with our program partners, we require strict contractual obligations that ensure safeguards for the privacy of information we share.

We never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to those described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

### Links

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Midwest Airlines is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to familiarize themselves with the privacy statements of every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.
