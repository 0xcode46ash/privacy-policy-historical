# Michaels.com Site Tour - Privacy Policy & The Legal Stuff

**Privacy Statement for Michaels.com**

Michaels Stores, Inc. ("Michaels") has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: Michaels.com (the "Site"). You can read our policy with respect to Children’s Privacy by clicking here.

Michaels is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Michaels collects information from our users at several different points on our website.

**Changes to Privacy Policy**

We may occasionally change our Privacy Policy. If we do, we will post the changes on the Site. The changes will take effect as soon as posted.

**Privacy on Public Forums**

This site makes chat rooms, forums, and message boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

**Children's Privacy Statement**

Michaels Stores, Inc. ("Michaels") has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") for MICHAELS.COM (the "Site"). This policy is intended to supplement our general Privacy Policy. If you want to read our Privacy Policy, click here.

The Site is owned and operated by Michaels Stores, Inc. located at 8000 Bent Branch Dr., Irving, Texas 75063.

**Policy regarding Children’s Use of Site**

Certain areas of the Site are directed at children, including children under the age of 13. Michaels encourages parents and caregivers to spend time online with children and to collaborate in the learning and fun offered at the Site. We recommend that an adult accompany children when using content on the Site.

Michaels will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If Michaels obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our system.

**Implementation of Policy**

A user is never required to disclose any personal information to visit the Site. Registration is encouraged so that adults and children over the age of 12 can take full advantage of the Site. Personal information is never collected from users who are not registered. Furthermore, during registration, a user is asked to provide his/her age. If the age disclosed is under 13 years of age, registration is refused. Until registration has been completed, our system does not actually store any personal information. 

Michaels cannot prevent a child under the age of 13 from sending e-mails or posting to the public areas of the Site. However, if Michaels obtains actual knowledge that an e-mail comes from a child under the age of 13, our customer service staff is trained to reply as follows: "Because we have actual knowledge that you may be a child under the age of 13, we are unable to correspond further with you, even with your parent’s consent. Please have your parent contact us directly. All personal information about you, including your e-mail address, is being deleted from our system." Upon providing this reply, all personal information about the author of the e-mail, including the e-mail address, is deleted from our system.

Michaels does not substantively monitor our public areas except to determine compliance with our Website Terms of Use. We do not require any user to disclose personal information to post in or otherwise use the public areas of the Site. If we obtain actual knowledge that a child under the age of 13 has disclosed personal information in a public area of our site, we will immediately delete any personally identifying information from the public area and from our system.

Michaels may occasionally run contests or sweepstakes. Like our general registration, sweepstakes and contests are not open to children under the age of 13. Any registration for a contest or sweepstakes likewise requests the age of the entrant. If the entrant is less than 13, entry is immediately refused.

Whenever the Site requests personal information from a visitor before the visitor can participate in an activity, the visitor is not required to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.

**Changes to Policy**

If Michaels changes its policy with respect to the collection of personal information about children under the age of 13, the changes will be posted here and will take effect immediately upon posting.
