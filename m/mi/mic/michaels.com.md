# Privacy Policy

Michaels Stores, Inc. (“Michaels”) has created this privacy statement outlining your privacy rights in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website which can be found at Michaels.com (the “Site”). You can read our policy with respect to Children’s Privacy by clicking here.

Michaels is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell or rent to or share this information with others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 

The following links are made available to help you find what you are looking for in our statement of Your Privacy Rights:

**Service Partners and Affiliates**  
In certain circumstances, Michaels may share your information with trusted service providers that need access to your information to provide us with data collection, storage, and reporting services. To ensure the confidentiality and security of your information, service providers must agree to safeguard your information in strict compliance with our policies. As a result of your accessing our Site, the trusted service providers may on our behalf, collect information about you. Your first name and email address (if you provide them) as well as your navigation path through the Site will be collected. We may also ask them to store, on our behalf, similar information that we collected prior to our relationship with them. This will enable Michaels to measure the number of visitors to the different areas of our Site, and to help make our Site more useful to our visitors.

**How And When We Collect Information; Information We Collect**  
We collect “personal” information from you when you provide it to us. For example, if you purchase an item or gift card from us, we may collect your name, mailing address, telephone number, credit card number and email address.  Contact information from your online registration is used to ship products. The contact information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary. Financial information that is collected is only used to bill you for the products you purchase.  Our Site’s registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and some demographic information (like address and age). We require you to register with your age so that we can comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. (We have a specific policy regarding children’s privacy, which you can view by clicking here.) If you select to receive information from Michaels, we will use customer contact information from the registration form to send you electronic newsletters or similar types of information. Your contact information is also used to contact you when issues arise with online orders.  If you sign up to receive a newsletter, we will collect your email address. If you utilize services or take advantage of special offers made by us or our marketing partners, we may collect other personal information about you.

Demographic and profile data is also collected at our Site and is currently solely used by Michaels to improve and manage the internal operations of our Site.

We also collect personal information to provide you with an efficient, customized experience.

**How We Use Your Information**  
We collect, store and process your personal information on servers located in the United States. We use the information we collect about you in order 1) to provide our services and process your transactions, 2) to provide customer service, 3) to determine your eligibility to receive offers for special features or products, and 4) to improve our products and services.

Michaels will not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to third parties. Michaels will not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described below, or with your express permission. These third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information is shared.

  | 

  * We may disclose the information we collect, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf. These companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit using the information except to market the specified Michaels-related products or services, unless you have affirmatively agreed or given your prior permission for other uses. 
  * We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users live in California. However, this aggregated information is not tied to personally identifiable information. 
  * As with any other business, it is possible that Michaels, in the future, could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by Michaels, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this statement of Your Privacy Rights unless and until it is amended as described below. 
  * We share your information with our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety. 

  
---|---  
  
The practices described above are in accordance with federal law.  You may have other protections under applicable state laws, such as those in Vermont, California and Nevada.

**For California residents:** Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as Senate Bill 27, if you are a California resident and Michaels has an established business relationship with you, you have the right to request information from Michaels, free of charge, regarding the manner in which Michaels shares certain categories of your personal information with third parties (whether collected online or offline), for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. California law provides that you have the right to submit a request to Michaels at its designated address and receive the following information: 1) the categories of information Michaels disclosed to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year; 2) the names and addresses of third parties that received such information; and 3) if the nature of a third party’s business cannot be reasonably determined from the third party’s name, examples of the products or services marketed, subject to certain exceptions. You are entitled to receive a copy of this information in a standardized format and the information will not be specific to you individually. For purposes of this paragraph:

  | 

  * “Michaels” means Michaels stores and the Site, and 
  * “Third Party” means: 

  
---|---  
  | 

\- a business that is outside the Michaels family, and 

\- affiliates of Michaels Stores, Inc.    
  
You will notice that the "third parties" listed in this notice are Michaels affiliates. These affiliates are listed as "third parties" because, under Senate Bill 27, any business that is a separate legal entity must be listed as a "third party."  

Our Michaels affiliates who may have received your information are as follows:

  | Aaron Brothers, Inc.   
1221 South Beltline Road, Suite 500  
Coppell, TX 75019  
| Artistree, Inc.  
850 North Lake Drive, Ste 500   
Coppell , TX 75019  
---|---|---  
  
This same California law permits Michaels to provide you, in response to your written request, with a cost-free means to choose not to have your information shared rather than providing the above described information. 

Michaels’ designated email address for such requests is [CAPrivacyRights@michaels.com](mailto:CAPrivacyRights@michaels.com). You may also request this information by writing to: Legal Department, Michaels Stores, Inc., 8000 Bent Branch Drive, Irving, Texas 75063.  Additionally, you may request that Michaels not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use by following the Choice/Opt-Out procedures outlined below.

**For Vermont residents:** Vermont law places additional limits on sharing information about Vermont residents.  As long as a user remains a resident of Vermont, we will not share information we collect about Vermont residents to companies outside of Michaels or to Michaels affiliates, except:

  | 

  * To companies that perform marketing or other services on our behalf;
  * Contact information (like name and address), and transaction information (such as your payment history) with which we have joint marketing agreements;
  * With the authorization or consent of the Vermont resident; or 
  * As permitted or required by law.

  
---|---  
  
**For Nevada residents:** We do not share your Customer Information with nonaffiliated third parties for purposes of their offering products and services to you. You do not need to take any action to limit this kind of information sharing.  Nevada law requires that we provide you with the following contact information if you desire for Michaels to include you in our internal do not call registry:

  | Michaels Stores, Inc.  
Attn:  Legal Department  
8000 Bent Branch Drive  
Irving, Texas 75063 | Bureau of Consumer Protection  
Office of the Nevada Attorney General  
555 E. Washington Street, Suite 3900  
Las Vegas, Nevada 89101  
Phone: (702) 486-3132  
Email: BCPINFO@ag.state.nv.us   
---|---|---  
  
In addition, if other states in the future adopt privacy restrictions more restrictive than those under Federal law we will comply with those applicable provisions.

**Updating Personal Information**  
If you are a registered user you can update the information you entered by [clicking here](https://web.archive.org/art/online/logonForm).

**Security**  
For your security, orders on our site are encrypted with SSL technology on both the client and server end. VeriSign has issued Michaels a unique ID, which assures visitors that they have reached our authentic site, thereby allowing communications to be encrypted. Michaels endeavors to make sure that every transaction with the Site is 100% safe and secure. In order for SSL to work, though, you must have a browser that supports SSL technology.

This Site takes every commercially reasonable precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the Site, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the standard encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Our employees are frequently notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment, with access restricted.

Please note that e-mail may not be encrypted and cannot be considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers. Michaels will never ask you to submit your credit card information via e-mail.

**Surveys & Contests**  
From time-to-time our Site may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user; therefore, has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Site.

**Privacy on Public Forums**  
This Site makes chat rooms, forums, and message boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

**Collection and Use of IP Addresses**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Abuse of Terms of Use**  
We have the right to share your name and contact information with our attorneys and law enforcement officials, if needed, in the event we believe you have breached our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/art/online/static?page=termsofuse) Agreement; [Terms of Sale](https://web.archive.org/art/online/static?page=termsofsale) Agreement or otherwise harmed us in any way.

We disclose information in response to subpoenas, warrants, court orders, levies, attachments, orders of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in civil actions. You authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, including in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other illegal activity.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you’ve visited. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. The information stored by one site into a cookie cannot be read by another web site.

We use cookies to provide you a richer, personalized experience on our Site, to customize your shopping experience, and to remember who you are when you revisit our site. We do not store any personal information about you in the cookie. We use this ID to track the pages you visit on our Site.

**Linked Sites**  
Our Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Michaels is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Michaels.

**Choice/Opt-Out**  
Our Site provides you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us. Michaels gives you the following options for removing your information from our database so that you do not receive future communications.

  | 

  * You can visit the Contact Us form on our web site, select the appropriate Subject (“Update your email address on our mailing list” or “Unsubscribe from our mailing list”), and submit the completed form. 
  * You can send email from your email ID of record to us with a subject line of UNSUBSCRIBE to [custhelp@michaels.com](mailto:custhelp@michaels.com).

By following the above outlined cost-free procedures, you may prevent disclosure of personal information.

**How We Use Email**  
Occasionally, we send out email updates on products, sales, special events, and promotions. Customers whom we think might be interested in learning about this information will receive these emails. Email offers that you receive from Michaels will tell you how to decline further email offers.

We also use email as a means of communicating with our customers. We love to hear from you, and we encourage you to email us with your questions or comments.

**Declining Email Offers**  
Michaels provides customers with a means of declining email offers. Although most customers tell us they appreciate receiving notice of these opportunities, we recognize the importance of providing you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by simply following the instructions contained in the email about how to inform us of your preferences.

**Changes to Privacy Statement**  
We may occasionally change our Privacy Statement. If we do, we will post the new statement of Your Privacy Rights on the Site. The changes will take effect as soon as posted.

* * *

**Ch** **ildren’s Privacy Statement**  
Michaels has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) for the Site. This policy is intended to supplement our general Privacy Statement. If you want to read our Privacy Statement, [click here](https://web.archive.org/art/online/static?page=privacyPolicy).

Although our Site is not specifically directed toward children, and we do not collect personal information from persons under the age of 13 on our Site, we recognize that parents and children visit this Site because of the family-friendly nature of our products. This provides us with the opportunity to help educate consumers about the Federal Trade Commission’s Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule. Please visit [www.ftc.gov/kidsprivacy](http://www.ftc.gov/kidsprivacy) for information from the Federal Trade Commission about protecting children’s privacy online.

**Policy regarding Children’s Use of Site**  
We recommend that an adult accompany children when using content on the Site. Michaels will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If Michaels obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our system.

Prospective users between the ages of 13 and 17 can only use the Site under their parents’ or legal guardian’s supervision. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you, your parent, or your legal guardian may request that we delete any of your personal information in our database and/or opt-out from receiving communications from us. If you wish to do so, please contact us at: [support@michaels.com](mailto:support@michaels.com).

**Implementation of Policy**  
A user is never required to disclose any personal information to visit the Site. Registration is encouraged so that adults and children 13 years old and older can take full advantage of the Site. Personal information is never collected from users who are not registered. Until registration has been completed, our system does not actually store any personal information.

Michaels does not substantively monitor our public areas except to determine compliance with our Site’s policies. We do not require any user to disclose personal information to post in or otherwise use the public areas of the Site. If we obtain actual knowledge that a child under the age of 13 has disclosed personal information in a public area of our Site, we will immediately delete any personally identifying information from the public area and from our system.

Michaels cannot prevent a child under the age of 13 from sending e-mails or posting to the public areas of the Site. However, if Michaels obtains actual knowledge that an e-mail comes from a child under the age of 13, our customer service staff is trained to initiate our internal COPPA compliance process which includes the deletion from our system of all personal information about the child, including the e-mail address.

Michaels may occasionally run contests or sweepstakes. Like our general registration, sweepstakes and contests are not open to children under the age of 13. Any registration for a contest or sweepstakes likewise requests the age of the entrant. If the entrant is less than 13, entry is immediately refused. Whenever the Site requests personal information from a visitor before the visitor can participate in an activity, the visitor is not required to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.

**Changes to Policy**  
If Michaels changes its policy with respect to the collection of personal information about children under the age of 13, the changes will be posted here and will take effect immediately upon posting.

The Site is owned and operated by Michaels Stores, Inc. located at 8000 Bent Branch Drive, Irving, Texas 75063
