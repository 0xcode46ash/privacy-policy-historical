# MicaSense Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of the MicaSense, Inc., a California Corporation ("MicaSense") policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any Personal Information you submit to us through www.micasense.com (the "Website").

By submitting Personal Information through our Website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Information may be processed by MicaSense in the country where it was collected as well as transferred to and processed in other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. 

We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through our Website, including as follows: 

  * When you register on the Website, we will collect your full name, email address, phone number, and your organization (if associated with an organization).
  * When you contact us to submit comments, questions or feedback using the forms on the Website or in the Website, we will collect your name, email address and your comment, question or feedback.
  * When you contact us by sending us an email, we will collect your email address and any information contained in the email you send us and any information attached to the email.



**Use of Information**

In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with the MicaSense newsletters, surveys, or promotional emails regarding changes and upgrades to our products and services and for other marketing purposes of MicaSense or our partners, should you request to receive such communications from us. 

**Feedback**

If you provide feedback on any of our products and services to us, we may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. MicaSense will collect any information contained in such communication and will treat the Personal Information in such communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

**Disclosure of Personal Information**

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade, rent, or share your Personal Information with third parties. We may share your Personal Information with third parties to provide you with the products and services that we offer you through the Website. These third parties are required not to use your Personal Information other than to provide the products and services requested by MicaSense and are bound by confidentiality agreements with regard to their use of such information. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Information with our contractors and third party service providers for the sole purpose of providing products and services to you. 

We may share some or all of your Personal Information with companies under common control such as any subsidiaries or joint ventures (collectively, "Affiliates"), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. 

If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Information (as described below), we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on MicaSense; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of MicaSense or users of our Services. 

**Your California Privacy Rights**
