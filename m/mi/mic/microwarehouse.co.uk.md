## Cookies

We can enhance the service if we learn about what you like and don't like. Microwarehouse assigns a number to each user to help us personalise the service for you. This number is saved on your computer and is called a 'cookie'. It is not possible to identify a particular user by means of a Cookie alone. You can be assured of anonymity. We will not know who you are, even if we issue a Cookie.

Of course if you want, you may choose not to accept or to delete the cookie that is held on your computer. The cookie is also used for anonymously recording what parts of the service you use. Overall, aggregated usage information from all our customers helps us improve Macwarehouse by showing us how different areas of the site are being used. 

Usage information may also be used to target advertising so you view ads, which have the most relevance for you. We also collect certain information you enter for the purpose of creating statistics. We will not link your name or address with the data we collect for statistical purposes.
