# The Micro:bit Foundation is a global non-profit organisation making invention with technology fun for everyone!

This is the privacy policy of the Micro:bit Educational Foundation. It defines how we deal with your information across all our services. 

We value the privacy of all our users. It is our intention that anyone interacting with the Micro:bit Educational Foundation and it's services will never have to disclose more information than is required for that specific interaction.

## Children

Although we have users of all ages, the BBC micro:bit and the resources provided on this website are designed for 8-12 years old (and the people who teach them). We consult with children and their educators on a regular basis to help the Foundation design new products, data collection and processing policies.

## GDPR

The Foundation is based in the UK and subject to GDPR legislation from the 25 May 2018. The Foundation is registered with the Information Commissions office.

## No cookies or analytics

microbit.org and tech.microbit.org are completely static web sites. They do not make use of cookies, browser based analytics or make requests to any third-party web site without you explicitly clicking a link (see Third party web sites section). However, some of our subdomains such as give.microbit.org, makecode.microbit.org and support.microbit.org may use cookies or analytics. Please see the Third party web sites section for more information.

## Server logs

Websites like microbit.org need web servers to process all the HTTP requests coming from browsers. Web servers make a note of every request or error in logs. A human or a computer can read these logs and determine 

  * Which page of the website is being requested
  * The time and date of the request
  * The IP making the request
  * The HTTP request code and the response the websever gave (e.g 404 for an error)
  * The browser and build version that made the HTTP request
  * The operating system and version of the machine making the request



The Foundation web team may look at these internal server logs to fix errors (such as the server being slow or a page being broken). We may use these logs if we think the website is under attack. 

We process the data from these logs using analytics software. This assumes that the data isn’t being faked. The software processes the data, essentially counting up all the types of requests. The processed data allows the Foundation to know how the website is being used (popularity of pages or browsers) and from the IP address, we can determine which country or region is making the request. 

We never combine this data with any data from any other system. So we never know how you use the website with your unique data provided to the Foundation in 3rd party systems. We also do not use this data to show you content based on a location. (So a student in Edinburgh UK has the same experience as someone in San Paulo, Brazil). 

We purge logs to save space and to secure the data on a regular basis.
