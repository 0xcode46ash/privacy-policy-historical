# Nikon MicroscopyU | Privacy Policy

#### MicroscopyU Internet Privacy Policy 

Thank you for visiting the MicroscopyU website, which is hosted by the Florida State University ( **FSU** ) in Tallahassee. Your privacy is very important to us. Simply stated, our policy is to collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you affirmatively choose to make such information available to us.

When you visit our website, our web server automatically recognizes only the Internet domain and IP (Internet Protocol) address from which you accessed our website. This information does not result in the identification of your personal e-mail address or other personal information.

In addition, we gather information regarding the volume and timing of access to our website by collecting information on the date, time and website pages accessed by visitors to the website. We do this so we can improve the content of our website and this information is not shared with other organizations. Again, only aggregate information is collected and individual visitors’ personal information is not identified.

MicroscopyU may provide links to other, externally operated websites which are not owned by **FSU** and are owned by companies, universities, or parties which are either affiliated or unaffiliated with **FSU**. These links to non- **FSU** websites are provided to you as a matter of convenience and for informational or reference purposes. If you access these links, you will no longer be on the MicroscopyU website. We do not endorse or make any representations about non- **FSU** websites, and we are not responsible for the privacy, content or security of such non- **FSU** websites. You are responsible for reviewing, and we encourage you to review the policies, including the privacy policy, of such non- **FSU** websites.

If you choose to share personal information with us—by sending us a message, or filling out an electronic form with personal information—we will use the information only for the purposes you authorized or in support of university sponsored programs. Some of the information may be saved for a designated period of time to comply with Florida’s archiving policies, but we will not disclose the information to other third parties or government agencies, unless required to do so by state or federal law or in support of university sponsored programs.

If we are required to disclose information about you by law, we will make every effort to notify you of the disclosure in advance.

Information security is important at **FSU** , and while no security measure is perfect or impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you provide to us, you can be assured that we maintain physical, electronic and administrative measures and safeguards and periodically review these security measures and safeguards to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized or inappropriate access and use.

If you have other questions about our privacy policies, or have ideas about improving our policies, please feel free to e-mail us at **[webmaster@microscopyu.com](mailto:webmaster@microscopyu.com)** , or you can reach us by telephone at 850-644-0542.
