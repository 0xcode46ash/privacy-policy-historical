# Privacy Policy - Microlancer

## Our policy

1
     Hi, we’re Envato. Welcome to the privacy policy for Microlancer, Envato’s marketplace for digital services. Your privacy is very important to us so we want to make it clear how we manage it and how you can manage it when you’re giving information to others. 
2
     When we talk about the **site** we’re referring to the Microlancer site. When we mention [Envato](http://envato.com/) it’s because that’s who we are and because we own and run the site. If we say **‘policy’** we’re talking about this privacy policy. If we say **‘user terms’** and **‘service provider additional terms’** we’re talking about the rules for using the site set out in our user terms. 

### Phew! Now that’s out of the way, let’s get on with the privacy information!

3
     This privacy policy explains how we use any information about you that you provide to us (which might identify you), or that we collect from you when you use the site (which is unlikely to identify you). We’ll also cover the content that you might share with others on the site including communications, materials and other content. So please take the time to read the policy because you accept it, as part of the user terms, when you use our site. 

## Personal Information

4
     You don’t need to provide any personal information to us just to visit the site but if you want to become a member and buy or provide services you will need to provide personal information to us. 

### Information you give to us

5
     When you provide information to us via the site you are consenting to the collection and use of your personal information by us. You are likely to provide personal information when you complete membership registration and also if you complete service provider registration. 
6
     Other ways you might give us personal information might include subscribing to hear from us, emailing us with a question or posting a comment on our sites. 
7
     We collect your personal information so that we can provide our Microlancer platform to you, so you can participate in the community by posting comments or reviews on the sites and so that we can answer questions you ask us. Sometimes we’ll use your personal information for administration or internal business purposes. 
8
     If you choose to buy or provide services on the site, we collect information about your buying and selling behavior. This information is only used for statistical and website development purposes. 

### Information you give to others

9
     If you voluntarily disclose personal or other information on any public part of the site, be aware that this will become public information and can be collected and used by others. We can’t control what others do with the personal information you’ve disclosed publicly on the site. Of course, if you post comments, or ask questions, using a user name alone, this might not be enough to allow others to identify you. 
10
     If you share information via social media you will be subject to the privacy policies of those sites. 
11
     If you use a payment method made available via the site, the payment method provider (not us) processes the additional information you provide, such as billing address, credit card number and credit card expiry date. We do not store this information. 

## Anonymous data, cookies and advertising

12
     When you visit our sites, we, and our support service providers like web analytics services, can record certain anonymous information in relation to your visit such as: 

  * Your IP or proxy server IP;
  * Basic domain information;
  * Your Internet service provider is sometimes captured depending on the configuration of your ISP connection;
  * The date and time of your visit to the website;
  * The length of your session;
  * The pages which you have accessed;
  * The number of times you access our site within any month;
  * The size of file you look at;
  * The website which referred you to Microlancer; and
  * The operating system which your computer uses.

We only use this information for statistical and website development purposes and to improve our services to you. It does not tell us who you are. 
13
     Occasionally, we may use third party advertising companies to serve ads based on prior visits to the site. These advertising companies use cookies to anonymously collect data. No personally identifiable information is collected by these cookies. The anonymous data they collect is kept separate from the personal information about you as a member. You can opt out of third party advertising cookies at any time by visiting this page: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>. 
14
     Other cookies are used to enhance your use of the site, such as remembering that you are logged in. You are able to minimise or block cookies using the privacy settings in your internet browser, but this may restrict your use of the site. For general information on cookies, see <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>. 

## Access to and/or changing your personal information

15
     You may request access to your personal information and can ask us to correct your personal information as well as being able to change that in your account page. You can also contact us [here](https://web.archive.org/contact) if you have any questions. 

## Security

16
     Our sites have reasonable security measures in place to protect the loss or misuse of, or alteration or unauthorised access to, information under our control. 

## When we have to update this policy

17
     Requirements around privacy are often changing and improving. As a result we’ll probably need to change this policy from time to time. When we do amend the policy the changes will be effective straightaway. We’ll usually publish information about changes being made on our site – but please be aware that it is your responsibility to check in and make sure you keep up to date with any changes to this policy. 

## Special circumstances

18
     Sometimes we might have an obligation to use or disclose your information in circumstance such as: 

  * we tell you about the intended use or disclosure and you don’t object to that use or disclosure;
  * we believe that the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary to assist a law enforcement agency or an agency responsible for governmental or public security in the performance of their functions; or
  * we are required by law to disclose the information.



## International transfer of information

19
     Our or our service providers’ servers and information processing equipment are located in number of countries around the world, so the information collected from you will be stored in those countries. 
20
     By voluntarily providing information to us when using the site, you are consenting to the collection and use of your personal information by us, including the transfer to another country other than Australia.
