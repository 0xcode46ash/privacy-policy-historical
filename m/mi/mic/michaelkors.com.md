The information we collect may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, items purchased, date of birth, payment information and other information you may provide to us. We may combine the information we collect from and about you online with the information we collect from and about you offline. We may also combine your information with information we receive about you from other sources, such as address update services. 

As part of the standard operation of the Site, we may collect certain non-personal information from you, including but not limited to your browser type, operating system, IP address and the domain name from which you accessed the Site. In addition, we may collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visit the Site, the areas or pages of the Site that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing the Site, the number of times you return to the Site and other click-stream data. 

We, or service providers acting on our behalf, may use cookies and web beacons to collect the non-personal information described above. A cookie is a small text file that may be stored on the hard drive of your computer when you access the Site. A web beacon is typically a one-pixel image, used to pass information from your computer to a website. We may also use cookies and web beacons to: (1) remember you when you return to the Site; (2) keep track of what you have in your online shopping cart; (3) provide you with customized content and advertising; (4) monitor Site usage; (5) measure the effectiveness of our advertising (both on our Site and on other sites) and emails; and (6) conduct research to improve our content, merchandise and services. 

You are free to decline cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the Site or take full advantage of all of our offerings. Check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. By declining cookies, you may also block certain web beacons. 

We also work with service providers that use cookies and web beacons to collect information about your visits to the Site and to other websites and serve advertisements to you, across the Internet, based on that information.
