Enterprise Events Group is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. In order to use portions of this web site, a user must first complete a registration form, enter their e-mail address, or provide similar information. A user may be required to give their contact information (such as name and e-mail address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. Users will occasionally receive information on products, services, special offers, newsletter and similar communications. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. 

Some features on this site include the use of cookies for added functionality or convenience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Enterprise Events Group is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

From time to time our site requests information from users via surveys, contests or forms. Participation in these is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address) and demographic information (such as zip code, profession). Such information will be used for purposes including monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

This web site takes care to protect our user's information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, your information is protected both on-line and off-line. When our forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and protected through SSL encryption. When secure, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open. 

If you have any questions about the security at our web site, you can send an e-mail to [webmaster@eegweb.com](mailto:webmaster@eegweb.com).
