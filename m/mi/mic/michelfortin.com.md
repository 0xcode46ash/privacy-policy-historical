### **The Success Doctor™'s Privacy Policy**

****

****At _SuccessDoctor.com_ , your privacy is assured. If you join the newsletter on this site, you will be kept posted on any developments that might benefit you (e.g., updates, announcements and special offers). However, note:

  * This site does not use "cookies" except for a single, nonidentifying one. It identifies you as a returning user but does not reveal any personal information about you. It's only a generic cookie used for the express purpose of limiting the number of times a popup appears.

This is done strictly for the convenience of users and not used for any other purpose. Any cookie or pop-up window blocking (or removal) program will not interfere with the navigation or enjoyment of this site.

  * This website does not gather personal information about you without your knowledge. Standard web server log files are kept for the sole purpose of administering this site. They are not used for any other purpose.

These files include user statistics, IP addresses (such as to identify geographic locations, ISPs and the like), user behavior (such as files requested), referrer URLs, time spent on each page, browser tags, OS tags, download quantities and screen resolutions.

  * My mailing lists are and will remain completely confidential. They are not (and will never be) sold to, rented to or shared with anyone. Upon request, you will be promptly removed from my databases without any questions. (Please see below for easy removal instructions.)

Although highly unlikely, a confirmation request will be emailed to you before any changes happen, if ever. **I respect your trust.**

  * And this website contains numerous links to other sites on the web. This site is not responsible for or has no control over the respective privacy practices of such sites. Your judgment is encouraged.

Appropriate action will be taken.

Also, not that this site uses several third parties to handle certain business services. Great care was taken in their selection. But if you have received unsolicited email as a result of using these services, please do not hesitate to report it immediately as well. They will be discontinued immediately.

#### Children's Privacy

I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If I learn at any time that I have personal information on a child under the age of 13, I will delete that information from my systems and databases.

_The Success Doctor_ encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer (you can also [check out the FTC's website](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html) for more tips on protecting children's privacy online):

* Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or adult guardian (includes name, address, phone, school, etc).
* Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate.
* Look for website privacy policies (and read them) of those visited by your child so you know how your child's information is treated.

#### **Questions?**

If you have any questions, comments or concerns about this privacy pledge or about the practices of this website, do not hesitate to **[contact me](https://web.archive.org/web/20041229191723id_/http%3A//successdoctor.com/forms/)** at any time, in complete confidence, or call me directly at (613) 834-6918.
