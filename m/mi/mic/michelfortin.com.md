### **The Success Doctor™'s Privacy Policy**

****

****At _SuccessDoctor.com_ , your privacy is assured. If you join the newsletter on this site, you will be kept posted on any developments that might benefit you (e.g., updates, announcements and special offers). However, note:

  * This site does not use "cookies" except for a single, nonidentifying one. This single cookie identifies you as a returning user but does not reveal any personal or private information about you. It's only a generic cookie used at the home page for the express purpose of limiting the number of times a popup window appears on that page. This is done strictly for the convenience of users and not used for any other purpose. Any cookie or pop-up window removal program will not interfere with the navigation or enjoyment of this site.
  * This site does not gather personal information about you without your knowledge. Standard web server log files are kept for the sole purpose of administering this site. They include user statistics, IP addresses (to identify geographic locations only), user behavior (such as files requested), referrer URLs, time spent on each page, browser tags, OS tags, download quantities and screen resolutions.
  * My mailing lists are and will remain completely confidential. They are not (and will never be) sold to, rented to or shared with anyone. Upon request, you will be promptly removed from my databases without any questions. (Please see below for easy removal instructions.) Although highly unlikely, a confirmation request will be emailed to you before any changes happen, if ever. I respect your trust.
  * And this website contains numerous links to other sites on the web. This site is not responsible for or has no control over the respective privacy practices of such sites. Your judgment is encouraged.  




If you received unsolicited commercial information about this website or its offerings from an unknown third party (i.e., "spam"), report it immediately to **[abuse@successdoctor.com](mailto:abuse@successdoctor.com)**. Appropriate action will be taken.

Also, not that this site uses several third parties to handle certain business services. Great care was taken in their selection. But if you have received unsolicited email as a result of using these services, please do not hesitate to report it immediately as well. They will be discontinued immediately.

Your energy, passion, and wisdom turbo charged me to the next level. You exceeded all my expectations and gave me value -- value far beyond my investment. Thanks for all the marketing tips and incredible insights. You have given me direction and focus -- two of the major things I requested. You obviously did your homework on me. Above all, I am impressed with how well-prepared you were. I appreciate that. I really don't know where all the time went. I never looked at my watch -- and, apparently, you didn't either. Thank you for that! Well, I can't write much more... You have given me too much homework to do. I can't wait to get started! I can honestly say that anyone who hires you will, I believe, immediately agree that you certainly earned your name, 'Success Doctor'. Thank you again!"**
