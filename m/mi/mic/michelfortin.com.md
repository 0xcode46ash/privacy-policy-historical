"I just wanted to thank you, Michel, for writing such a fantastic website sales letter for us! So far, our income has quadrupled. In fact, we've made in one week what we would usually make in an entire month! Michel, you have a way with words -- and I'll certainly be calling upon you in the future to help us maximize our other projects. So far the second web salesletter you did is pulling at around 10%! Thank you for a great job! In fact, I really don't know what we'd do without you... So, please, don't go getting hit by a bus or anything! Thank you for everything!"  
**Tameka Sowder, Affiliate Mastery**

"What most people sometimes miss is that, whatever fees are paid to a copy writer of Michel's stature, it's indeed an investment. The boost in conversion rate and sales from Michel's work pays for the one time, initial cost, over and over again. Michel's work is defnitely tops."   
**Bob Silber, Internet Marketing Law Products**

"I've recommended Michel to my clients when they asked me for advice. My clients are usually very good friends, too, so that'll tell you what I think of his abilities and professionalism."  
**Paul Myers, TalkBiz.com**

"Michel, as to the email advertorial you wrote for me, it is _**OUTSTANDING**_ , my friend! It is very smooth, it sets up a good case and it piles the values on! And it even made 'me' want to buy it! I will use it as is." _  
_**Dr. Sheldon Nix _,_ The Successful Practice Institute**

"Michel Fortin is the King of Copywriting on the web. Check out his site. And while you're there, you'll also want to subscribe to his free newsletter as it's loaded with excellent content to help you become a better copywriter. He's the Man!"  
**Merle Stinett, Ezine Ad Auction**

"I hear _**NOTHING**_ but great things about you. (...) Your work is so darn good. I thought you might like to see this testimonial that one of my clients (I referred to you) sent me. Thanks for helping him!"

#### Children's Privacy

I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If I learn at any time that I have personal information on a child under the age of 13, I will delete that information from my systems and databases.

_The Success Doctor_ encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer (you can also [check out the FTC's website](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html) for more tips on protecting children's privacy online):

* Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or adult guardian (includes name, address, phone, school, etc).
* Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate.
* Look for website privacy policies (and read them) of those visited by your child so you know how your child's information is treated.

#### **Questions?**

If you have any questions, comments or concerns about this privacy pledge or about the practices of this website, do not hesitate to **[contact me](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203092448id_/http%3A//successdoctor.com/forms/index.htm)** at any time, in complete confidence, or call me directly at (613) 748-1624.

And community is built on trust and inherent in that trust is your right to privacy. As such, you deserve to choose what information you want to share, and to know what will happen to that information once you have shared it. This is your right."_
