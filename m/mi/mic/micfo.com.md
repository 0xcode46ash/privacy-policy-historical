# Micfo International LLC - Web Hosting Privacy Policy

**Micfo International LLC strives hard to protect and safeguard every piece of information collected from its customers. There would be no compromise what-so-ever in doing so.**

**STORED CUSTOMER DATA**

1.Every customer who subscribe to Micfo International LLC's hosting services have to provide the following information which is kept on record as the official contact details.

• **Complete Postal Address**  
• **Current Telephone Number**  
• **A Working Fax Number**  
• **Individual email address**

The above information is used to establish communications with the customer once their sign-up is received. Micfo International LLC follows a very **strict verification process** as part of the credit card and paypal **fraud-detection process** which involves telephoning every customer and verifying the contact details provided during the signup, the payment mode and the exact amount tendered to Micfo.

The above contact details are also listed while registering a domain name for the customer and also for any domain transfer request placed by the customer. All the domain names under the customer's account will show the contact details as submitted by the customer (unless stated otherwise). It is binding on all customers to give a valid snail-mail (postal) address for domain registration.

2\. Customer's email address will be the primary mode of contact and communications at all times. All the information related to the account viz. support tickets, invoices, account mails and every other communication would be done through emails. Any account related or service request would have to be sent through the primary email address only as it is also used as a mode of user authentication. 

The primary email address of the user will also be used as the registered administrator's contact email address whenever a domain is registered or transferred.

3\. Micfo International LLC uses web cookies to store customer's general internet preference. These cookies are packets of text sent by the server to a web browser and then recalled by the browser everytime it is accessed by the server. Other purposes of collecting web data through cookies include maintaining user specific information and help authenticate and track their sessions, to help learn about their browser choice, website preferences and general internet browsing. However, all these would be of no use what-so-ever in the event of a customer changing their browser settings.

**PROTECTING DATA**

1\. Micfo International LLC has in place dual procedures which involves a combination of electronic as well as manual steps to secure the information submitted by customers. All such data which is available for a customer in our billing software as well as official records is only accessible to Micfo's working personnel and the management itself. **Managerial clearance** has to be obtained for any other data which needs to be accessed by the general staff. These multiple authentication barriers prevent customer data from being misused.

2\. A **128-bit SSL encryption** has been put in place which guarantees that the private information which has been stored for the customer is secure. Micfo's orientation course includes special training for personnel who would be handling the databases which store such information which provides cover against any mis-appropriation or malicious use of such data and information.

3\. If a customer is requesting for the contact information to be stored or for their website or server files to be deleted completely or for any other service request for which client authentication is deemed to be mandatory, **multiple recognition methods** are followed. Changes and service requests are processed only after the identity of the customer has been established beyond apprehensions.

4\. Micfo International LLC is bound by US Federal laws to extend its fullest co-operation and help to any government recognized authority and agencies as well as internet watchdogs when they seek information and details of customers registered with Micfo. It is a social as well as **corporate obligation** to do so. Other than such occasions, customer data or information is never provided to any external source what-so-ever the situation maybe.

**Customers have every authority to report any violation or breach of the above mentioned privacy policy. An email should be sent to feedback@micfo.com with the details of any such event. Micfo International LLC will take all the necessary measures and remedial course of action within 24 hours of the receipt of such an email.**
