We recognize that when you share your personal information with us, you expect us to treat that information in a serious and responsible manner. This Privacy Policy below discloses what information we gather, how we use that information, and how you can correct or change that information. In summary, you should know that 

  * Micron has security measures in place to keep your personal information secure. 
  * Micron does not sell your personal information to other companies. 



**Security**  
Micron's site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, including without limitation protecting information behind a firewall within a perimeter network and, encrypting your ordering information during transmission. 

**Registration and order forms**  
If you choose to register with Micron or to place an order with us, we may ask that you provide us with contact information (first and last name, e-mail address and telephone number), financial information (account or credit card numbers), demographic information (address, age, or income level), and unique identifiers (tax ID number), information about where you learned of our products and information about your intended use of our products. We do not purge customer information on a regular basis, so information you provide us will remain in our systems for an indefinite amount of time. We may use your contact information to send you information about us and to contact you when necessary. If you do not want to receive any mailings from us, please see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information is used only to bill you for products. Demographic information may be used to tailor your experience at our sites, showing you information that we think you might be interested in, and presenting information according to your preferences. We may use demographic information to develop summary - but not individual - reports for our advertisers so that they may determine how effective their advertising investments are. We never tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements, unless you have specifically told us that this is acceptable. In addition, our sales and marketing departments may also use demographic information, information about where you learned of our products and information about your intended use of our products to improve our advertising and marketing efforts and to measure interest in our products. We may use unique identifiers to verify our resellers and customers and to allow customers to identify themselves to us. 

**Surveys and contests**  
Micron may invite you to participate in online surveys or contests. Participation is never required. If you choose to participate, you may be asked to disclose contact and demographic information as well as additional information about you and/or your company. We may use this information to send you information about our company, contact you when necessary, tailor your experience at our site, display information according to your preferences and improve our Web sites, products and advertising. If you do not want to receive any mailings from us, please see the choice/opt-out section below. This information may be shared with our advertisers on a summary, not individual, basis. 

**Public forums**  
Micron may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to you. Because any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, you should exercise caution when deciding whether to disclose your personal information. 

**Information requests**  
You may be able to request information on our sites regarding our products and services, including technical support and customer service, by using online forms. We ask that you provide certain contact information to allow us to fulfill your request and to send you information about Micron's products and services.

**Children's guidelines**  
Micron's sites are not geared towards children. Micron does maintain a few Web pages designed to provide young people educational and charitable information. On all Micron sites, Micron attempts to protect children. Micron must, however, rely on the information provided to us by visitors to our sites. As a result, it is impossible for us to guarantee with absolute certainty that the information collected and utilized by Micron is or is not derived from a child. The following sets forth Micron's policy with respect to the collection and/or use of children's information: 

  * For purposes of this Policy, a "child" is an individual age 12 or younger 
  * We do not collect children's contact information without prior parental consent, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. Without prior parental consent, online information will only be used to respond directly to the child's request and for no other purpose. 
  * We do not collect children's personally identifiable offline contact information without prior parental consent. 
  * We do not distribute children's personal information to any third party without prior parental consent. 
  * We do not provide the ability to publicly post or otherwise transmit information that could be used to identify a child without prior parental consent. 
  * We do not entice children by the prospect of a special game, prize, or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity. 



**IP addresses**  
We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, administer our sites, and gather broad demographic information to measure general interest in our products and to share with our advertisers on a summary, not individual, basis. 

**Cookies**  
Our Web servers may place small bits of text or "cookies" onto your computer's hard drive and memory. Cookies enable us to identify you so you do not have to re-enter certain information each time you visit our sites and allow us to keep track of your shopping choices. 

Often we use third-party services to help us measure the effectiveness of our Web site. These companies may place third-party cookies on your hard drive to help us analyze the traffic on our Web site and better meet our customers' needs. This does not give Micron or any other company access to your personal information or other information on your computer. We do not track or store any personally identifiable information. If you are concerned, you can set your browser to decline third-party cookies, or you can delete these cookies from your hard drive. 

**Supplemental information**
