# Michelin | Privacy Policy

  
**Information Collection and Use**

**What information do we collect?**  
We collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address. Our servers typically log your IP address when you request a page from this website. You remain anonymous to us since we do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. However, we do collect personally identifiable information about you when you voluntarily submit it to us, such as by: filling out a form or survey; participating in a promotion, contest or sweepstakes; registering your e-mail address with us; signing up for an e-mail newsletter; or, e-mailing us. 

**How do we use this information?**  
Your personally identifiable information may be shared with and stored on a database controlled by third parties that have been hired by Michelin to provide limited services on our behalf. Agents or contractors of Michelin who have access to your personally identifiable information are required to use their best efforts to keep the information confidential and are prohibited from using this information for any purpose not previously disclosed to you. 

Michelin uses personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information for site administration and for the purpose of performing the services for which such data was collected. 

We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties, unless disclosure is required by law or to protect our interests. 

Even though our information practices may change from time to time, we will not use your information in a manner not previously disclosed to you in our Privacy Policy. We will always provide you with notice by posting any privacy policy changes on this website, and you will have an opportunity to reject such changes. 

**Update or Correct**

If you provide us with personally identifiable information to have Michelin perform ongoing services for you, we will do our best to provide you with a way to review the information we have on file and either update or correct. 

**Children's Privacy Protection**

We do not wish to obtain personally identifiable information from children who are using our site unsupervised. Thus, we ask children to obtain the consent of their parent or guardian before providing us with any personally identifiable information. 

**Security Precautions**

Your privacy is very important to us. We use leading security technology and security procedures to help maintain the privacy of your personal information. Among other techniques, we usually store such information on a computer behind our "firewall" in a secure location, and we often restrict the number of employees internally who can access this data. Of course, there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet and we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. Further, please note that our servers are run by a third party web host whose actions we do not control. 

**Trademark and Copyright Notice**

Please consult our Terms of Use for further information. 

**Your Consent to This Privacy Policy**
