# Misk.com - Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy governs the ways in which Nitin Corporation d/b/a Misk.com (Misk, we or our) collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from our customers, visitors to our websites, and visitors to our customer’s websites (Customers, you, or your). 

In the course of providing services to Customers or visitors to our website, we collect information.  Everyone has a different definition of what information they consider to be private.  The purpose of our Privacy Policy is to discuss how we handle the majority of information we collect, or which comes into our possession.  Simply because information is discussed in this policy does not mean it is necessarily considered by us to be private.  Our Privacy Policy supplements, but does not replace our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/legal/tos.aspx "Terms of Service") and [Acceptable Use Policy](https://web.archive.org/legal/aup.aspx "Acceptable Use Policy").  Those policies should be read in conjunction with this policy.  If at any time, you would like to know how specific information is handled, please e-mail us at:  [ privacy@misk.com](mailto:privacy@misk.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy "privacy@misk.com"). 

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage.  


How we collect information 

Cookies.  Our website uses cookies.  Cookies are small data files that are placed automatically on your computer by our computers or those of our third party service providers. Some of our business partners and equipment we use to provide products and services (Services) to you may also place cookies on your computer.  We do not control those cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties. 

Customer Information.  You provide us with your name, address, phone number, email address, username/password, credit/debit card or bank information and other personally identifiable or confidential information.  This information is provided in a number of ways:  registration, ordering, and other requests for information.  If you were referred to our site by a source known to us, this referral data is also recorded.  This information is all aggregated to create an administrative record that includes data related to the Services, how you use the Services, problems related to the Services, and notations from our staff about our relationship with you, among other things (Customer Information).

How We Use the Information We Collect

Customer Information.  We use Customer Information to identify Customers individually.  Customer Information is used throughout our business to provide the Services to you.  Information related to payment, such as a Customer’s credit card number, is only used to ensure we receive payment for the Services.  It may be shared with third parties affiliated with us if they provide services through us to you and those services are billed by them independently.  No other Customer Information is disclosed outside Misk, except as provided below.  Customer Information may be stored by us following termination of the services. 

Domain Name Information.  All Domain Name Information is public information.  We only use this Domain Name Information to provide the Services.  When you sign up for domain registration services, we share your domain name information, as necessary with third parties to provide that service. These third parties may use Domain Name Information differently.  Domain Name Information may be stored by us following termination of the Services. 

Customer Inquiries.  We use Customer Inquiry Information to identify you individually.  It is used throughout our business to provide the Services to you.  Customer Inquiry Information may be shared with third parties to identify and fix problems with the Services when we are not capable of doing so ourselves.  Customer Inquiry Information may be stored by us following termination of the Services. 

Statistical Information.  We use the Statistical Information to operate our hardware and software, diagnose problems and administer our website.  We may use this information to modify the Services based on who is visiting our website and what they are purchasing.  Statistical Information may be used to identify you individually.  Statistical Information may be stored by us following termination of the services.  


Emails From Misk.  While your account is active with us, you may not generally opt out of receiving service related email communications from Misk such as order confirmation emails, critical service changes/updates, new product notifications, etc.  


Agents. We use credit card processing companies to bill you for your goods and services. These companies do not use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.

Other Disclosures.  Misk is required to comply with relevant laws, regulations, court/judicial orders, or legal process served.  Information covered by this Privacy Policy, as well as other categories of information, may be disclosed to third parties if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such a disclosure is necessary or required.  We may also disclose this information if, in our sole discretion, such a disclosure is necessary or required to protect our interests or the interests of our customers, in connection with the sale of our business, and to contractors, and other third parties we use to help us create and operate the Services. 

Data Security 

The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  The information set out in this Privacy Policy is protected using industry standard security measures.  However, no means of communication or information transmission or storage is totally secure.  We cannot be responsible for loss corruption or unauthorized acquisition and use of information, or for any damages resulting therefrom, including unauthorized acquisition and use.
