If you are not in when the courier initially tries to deliver your parcel and they cannot find a safe location to leave the package, they will leave a card explaining that there was an unsuccessful attempt to deliver the parcel.

To use this option, contact Yodel via its online tracking system or automated call system. Details of both can be found on Yodel’s website http://www.myyodel.co.uk/.

  * Producer Responsibility Obligations



UK Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations (SI 2006 No. 3289)

So that you can get your old electrical products recycled, Arcadia have contributed toward the development of recycling collection points (known as ‘Designated Collection Facilities) throughout the UK through our membership of the Distributor Take Back Scheme (DTS).

UK households dispose of over 1.2 million tonnes of electrical and electronic waste every year. This is the equivalent of 150,000 double decker buses and would be enough to fill the new Wembley Stadium 6 times over. Much of the UK's electronic waste ends up in landfill sites, where toxins put communities at risk.

To remind you to recycle, all new electrical products are marked with a crossed out wheeled bin symbol.

  


Not all council sites are suitable to collect all types of waste electrical goods. To find out your nearest participating site and for advice on all aspects of recycling at home, please visit [www.recycle-more.co.uk](http://www.recycle-more.co.uk/)

Please remember to have your postcode to hand.

Miss Selfridge is committed to reducing the impacts of its packaging on the environment. Our aim is to reduce our production of packaging waste, maximise recycling and reduce disposal to landfill as far as reasonably possible.  

We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously and aim to continually reduce the impacts of our waste on the environment. We are a registered business under the UK’s Packaging Regulations and contribute toward the recycling of packaging waste arising in the UK. 

Where possible, we will encourage our customers to recycle their own waste. For further information on how you can help to recycle more and where you can recycle your waste, please visit [www.recyclenow.com](http://www.recyclenow.com/). 

Any items ordered remain our property until we receive full payment.
