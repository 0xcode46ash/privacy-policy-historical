We aim to deliver all main land UK nominated day orders on the day you specify. Next working day delivery is available for orders placed before 9pm Monday - Friday, or before 2pm on Sunday (GMT).

Deliveries to Northern Ireland, the Highlands and Islands and AB postcodes will take longer to arrive and will not arrive on your nominated day.

If you decide to have your parcel delivered to an alternative address, we may be able to change it provided the new address is within the same local area as the original address, although this service is not guaranteed.

If you select a nominated day delivery and include your mobile telephone number at the checkout, you will be notified on the day of delivery via a text message that your parcel will be delivered that day. You will also receive an email. 

If you are not in when the courier initially tries to deliver your parcel and they cannot find a safe location to leave the package, they will leave a card explaining that there was an unsuccessful attempt to deliver the parcel. The courier will leave a mobile phone number on the card so that you can arrange another delivery attempt, or arrange to collect your parcel from your local Yodel depot. To use this option, contact Yodel via its online tracking system or automated call system. Details of both can be found on Yodel’s website http://www.myyodel.co.uk/. You are required to give Yodel at least 24 hours advance warning if using this facility, so that your parcel can be readied for collection.  Opening times of your local Yodel service centre can be found on the delivery card that the courier will leave after an unsuccessful delivery attempt.

Please note that for security reasons, you will need to present two forms of identification when collecting your parcel, one of each of the following:

1\. Photographic (e.g. passport, driving licence)

2\. Utility bill or similar, including name and address.

When you place an order on our website we shall email you an order confirmation email. Our acceptance of your order does not take place until despatch of the order, at which point the contract for the purchase of goods will be made and you will be charged and you will be charged.

Once you have checked out and you have received your order confirmation email you will not be able to make any changes to your order so please make sure that everything is correct before clicking the ‘CONFRIM & PAY’ button.

Any discounts triggered by the entry of a promotional code will not be applied until the order is accepted but will be detailed on the invoice.

We reserve the right to refuse an order. Non-acceptance of an order may, for example, result from one of the following:

    * The product ordered being unavailable from stock

    * Our inability to obtain authorisation of payment

    * The identification of an error within the product information, including price or promotion

    * If we suspect any fraudulent activity

If there are any problems with your order we shall contact you. We reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase by you at any time. We will take all necessary measures to keep the details of your order and payment secure..

Prices are subject to change without notice. These changes will not affect orders that have already been despatched. Prices are inclusive of VAT (where applicable).

Goods are subject to availability. As there is a delay between the time when the order is placed and the time when the order is accepted, the stock position relating to particular items may change. If an item you have ordered becomes out of stock before we accept the order we shall notify you as soon as possible and you will not be charged for the out of stock items.

We continually update our website. From time to time our stores may run special local promotions (which may not be available on our website) or we may offer special discounts online that are not available in stores. Additionally, some website promotions may not be available to customers in particular jurisdictions.

  * Ethical Policy
  * Producer Responsibility Obligations



UK Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations (SI 2006 No. 3289)

So that you can get your old electrical products recycled, Arcadia have contributed toward the development of recycling collection points (known as ‘Designated Collection Facilities) throughout the UK through our membership of the Distributor Take Back Scheme (DTS).

UK households dispose of over 1.2 million tonnes of electrical and electronic waste every year. This is the equivalent of 150,000 double decker buses and would be enough to fill the new Wembley Stadium 6 times over. Much of the UK's electronic waste ends up in landfill sites, where toxins put communities at risk.

To remind you to recycle, all new electrical products are marked with a crossed out wheeled bin symbol.

  


Not all council sites are suitable to collect all types of waste electrical goods. To find out your nearest participating site and for advice on all aspects of recycling at home, please visit [www.recycle-more.co.uk](http://www.recycle-more.co.uk/)

Please remember to have your postcode to hand.

Miss Selfridge is committed to reducing the impacts of its packaging on the environment. Our aim is to reduce our production of packaging waste, maximise recycling and reduce disposal to landfill as far as reasonably possible.  

We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously and aim to continually reduce the impacts of our waste on the environment. We are a registered business under the UK’s Packaging Regulations and contribute toward the recycling of packaging waste arising in the UK. 

Where possible, we will encourage our customers to recycle their own waste. For further information on how you can help to recycle more and where you can recycle your waste, please visit [www.recyclenow.com](http://www.recyclenow.com/). 

Any items ordered remain our property until we receive full payment.
