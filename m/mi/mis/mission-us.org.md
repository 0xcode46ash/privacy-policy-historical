# Privacy Policy - WNET

**_(Updated June 7, 2017)_**

**Thank you** **  for visiting the WNET Privacy Policy (the “Policy”).  We believe that maintaining the highest standards of privacy online and on mobile devices is crucial to maintaining your trust in WNET.  For this reason, we want to inform our visitors about the types of information we collect and how we use and store that information.**

## **1\. Sites Covered by this Policy**

This Policy and the WNET [Terms of Service](http://www.thirteen.org/about/terms-of-service/) govern the websites, online services, and mobile applications made available by WNET, including but not limited to [www.wnet.org](http://www.wnet.org/), [www.wliw.org](http://www.wliw.org/), [www.njtvonline.org](http://www.njtvonline.org/), [www.thirteen.org](http://www.thirteen.org/), [www.wavelengthpublicmedia.org](http://www.wavelengthpublicmedia.org/), and [www.nyc-arts.org](http://www.nyc-arts.org/), and the THIRTEEN Explore, MetroFocus, and NYC-ARTS applications ** ** (collectively, the “WNET Sites”). WNET, THIRTEEN Productions LLC, WLIW LLC, Public Media NJ Inc., Creative News Group LLC, and Interactive Engagement Group LLC (collectively, “WNET”) are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of the WNET Sites’ users, visitors, members, donors, and friends.

Please note that the WNET Sites often link to third party sites or services, including social media and sites or services owned or controlled by PBS and other public media entities and production partners. This Privacy Policy does not cover any third party sites or services, or use thereof, and we suggest that you review those sites’ policies to learn more about their privacy practices.

## **2\. Information We Collect**

The WNET Sites collect only information that is reasonably necessary to facilitate and optimize the WNET Sites and the activities available on them.

**A. Information You Provide to Us (Personally Identifiable Information)**

You may be asked to provide some personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) to participate in some activities on the WNET Sites. If you do not want Personal Information to be collected or used by us for these purposes, you can simply choose not to submit your information. However, this may prevent your participation in these activities. Some of the purposes for which WNET may request Personal Information include:

**a.    Making a Membership Pledge**  
We will ask you to provide the information necessary (name, billing and shipping address, telephone number, email address, and credit card number) to process and service your membership pledge for THIRTEEN, WLIW, or NJTV. Credit card information is encrypted for your security and is only accessible by the membership staff processing your gift and by our contracted fulfillment agencies.

**b.    Completing an Online Survey**  
WNET occasionally posts surveys on its sites. These surveys, which are completely voluntary, may ask about your interests, occupation, educational background, and so on. We use this voluntarily provided information to understand our members and viewers better and to determine how best to serve them, and we store survey answers separately from email addresses and other Personal Information. Personal Information collected in surveys is not shared with third parties, and other potentially personal responses are not shared unless terms agreed to in connection with the survey state otherwise.

**c.   Uploading Content**  
If you are uploading any user-generated or other content (collectively, “UGC”) to Wavelength or any other WNET Site you may be asked to submit certain Personal Information, including without limitation your name and email address, and to agree to certain terms in connection with such submission.  WNET will not use any Personal Information submitted in connection with UGC except in compliance with the terms agreed to upon submission and this Privacy Policy.

**d. Entering a Promotion**  
WNET may offer you the opportunity to enter sweepstakes, contests, or other promotions on the WNET Sites or through social media pages owned or controlled by WNET.  You may be required to provide your name and email address at the time of entry, and WNET may also request additional contact information (e.g., your street address or phone number) so that we may contact you in connection with the promotion.  Please see each promotion’s individual rules or terms for further information.

**B.     Information We Collect Automatically (Aggregate and Other Non-Personal Information)**

Our server tracks how you and other visitors use the WNET Sites, identifying the source of visitors and what pages and functions they use and view. By looking at this aggregated, non-personally identifiable information we can better understand our community, which allows us to improve our websites and mobile applications and to provide you with an optimal experience and better service.  We may supplement Personal Information we collect from you with, e.g., geographic data or content customization drawn from your usage of WNET Sites.

**a.   Cookies and Tracking Technologies**  
In order to provide optimal service and convenience we may use industry-standard tracking technologies, such as “cookies.”  Cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and other tags) are temporary bits of code placed in your web browser that allow WNET to track how you use the WNET Sites, and facilitate communication when you browse WNET Sites. Cookies are completely anonymous and help us serve you: we use information gathered with cookies to optimize the WNET Sites and your browsing experience. We also use cookies when you make a pledge to keep track of items you add to your pledge basket so you can continue to browse the WNET Sites until you are ready to check out. At no time does the cookie reveal your name, address, email, or telephone number (even if you have entered these in other areas of WNET Sites). You always have the ability to set your browser to refuse to accept cookies without limiting your ability to make a pledge securely or browse the WNET Sites – though some parts of the WNET Sites may not function properly if cookie acceptance is disabled.

**b.   Third Party Tracking**  
Third parties, including those advertising on our sites and our advertising analytics partners, may also use tracking technologies to follow your use of the WNET Sites or sponsor messages and acknowledgements placed on the Sites.  WNET does not control third party tracking, which occurs on our Sites by DoubleClick; you may opt out of DoubleClick tracking by visiting Google’s [DoubleClick opt-out page](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated#display_optout) and control your trackability more widely at the [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

## **3\. How We Use Your Information**

WNET does not sell or rent Personal Information of members, donors, or website visitors under any circumstances, and we do not share member, donor or visitor information without prior consent except as compelled by law or provided in this Policy.

**A. Personal Information**

Personal Information will only be used as provided herein.  Specific uses may include: operating and providing the WNET Sites and our business; optimizing and customizing the WNET Sites to improve your experience; communicating with you; enforcing WNET’s Terms of Service; and any other functions described in connection with collection of your Personal Information.

**B. Aggregate and Other Non-Personal Information**

In general, the information we collect automatically may be used to respond to your requests, enable you to take advantage of WNET Site features and services, optimize content and user experience, measure analytics, and manage and improve the services available on the WNET Sites.

## **4\. Information We Share With Third Parties**

WNET will not share the Personal Information you provide except as provided in this Policy, including as follows:

  * with carefully selected parties that perform functions connected to operation of the WNET Sites (who are only permitted to access and use Personal Information connected to or derived from the WNET Sites in connection with the WNET Sites, and are not given access to any WNET servers or databases containing Personal Information);
  * as required by law, or by legal claims or investigations (in which case WNET would seek, where possible, to have such information disclosed under seal or other applicable protection);
  * in connection with a corporate event or reorganization such as merger or bankruptcy; or
  * with your prior consent.



If you do not opt out as provided below, you hereby consent that WNET may also share your contact information with certain other non-profit organizations. However, in no event will WNET sell, license, lease, lend, trade, donate, transfer, exchange or otherwise disclose the station’s membership lists with, or acquire such lists from, any candidate for public office, committees or organizations supporting a candidate, political parties, or organizations that solicit funds for use in political campaigns. If you would prefer not to have your Personal Information shared with third parties, contact us by emailing [membership@WNET.org](mailto:membership@WNET.org) or calling our Membership department at 212-560-2888.

## **5\. Information Collected From Kids**

The WNET Sites consist of general audience websites and mobile applications not designated or intended for use by children under the age of 13. Nonetheless, WNET takes great pride in the responsible and quality content and services we provide for children. For this reason, WNET does not knowingly collect or store Personal Information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child (who is under 13) has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us. Upon request, we will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.

In the event that your child completes an enrollment form on one of WNET’s Sites and WNET learns that your child is under the age of 13, we will promptly delete your child’s information.

WNET will not condition your child’s participation in any activity on the child’s disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such an activity. You may, at any time, review and have deleted your child’s Personal Information and refuse to permit further collection or the use of such information by emailing [membership@WNET.org](mailto:membership@WNET.org).

## **6\. PBS Passport Service**

If you are viewing on-demand video on the WNET Sites through the PBS Passport service or player, you have agreed that PBS may collect your viewing and usage information and that PBS may share this information with WNET.  Your individual and usage viewing information will only be shared with WNET, but PBS may share aggregate de-identified viewing and usage information with its member stations and service providers, as well as WNET.  PBS’s collection, storage, and use of Passport information is subject to PBS’s [Terms and Conditions](http://www.pbs.org/about/terms-conditions/).

## **7\. Security and Storage of Information**

WNET stores your Personal Information using reasonable security precautions and for only as long as we think reasonably necessary. We make every effort to ensure that all of the transactions that occur on the WNET Sites are secure. Personal Information that you submit with your pledge is also encrypted. However, no transmission of data is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties to unlawfully intercept transmissions. If you believe a third party has accessed your information, please contact us immediately. If you do not feel comfortable submitting your Personal Information online you can make your pledge by calling us at 800-468-9913.

## **8\. Your Control over Your Information**

You may choose and control what information you provide about yourself and certain information which is automatically collected by the WNET Sites. You have the right to update and correct any Personal Information we collect about you. You also have the right to opt-out of future communications from WNET or request that WNET remove your information or cease tracking your individual activity, either online or via mobile devices. You can accomplish this by emailing [membership@WNET.org](mailto:membership@WNET.org), calling our Membership department at 212-560-2888, or changing the settings on your mobile application.

## **9\. Acceptance of This Policy**

By using the WNET Sites, you expressly consent to WNET’s collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your information, and any other terms and conditions of this Policy. This Policy refers solely to the WNET Sites and does not cover websites that are linked from any WNET Site, such as PBS websites and those of corporate funders. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Policy at any time. Your continued use of the WNET Sites following the posting of any changes to this Policy shall signify an acceptance of those changes. Please check this page periodically for updates.

## **10\. Changes to This Policy**

Whenever this Policy changes, we will post the changes to the WNET Sites, and those changes will be effective immediately upon posting. If you do not agree to the changes, please do not continue to use the WNET Site. Under certain circumstances, we may also elect to notify you of changes to this Policy by additional means, such as posting a notice on a WNET Site or sending you an e-mail if we have your e-mail address.

## **11\. Contact Us**

We try to read and respond promptly to every inquiry that we receive. If you email or call WNET, we will make sure your question or comment reaches the appropriate person.
