All web servers track basic information about their visitors. This information includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser details, timestamps and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify specific visitors to this site. The information is tracked for routine administration and maintenance purposes. In addition to server tracking engine, I also use Google Analytics (TM).

I will never use or share any of the information collected in ways unrelated to the ones described above. I do not send spam and I will not sell your information to any company for marketing purposes. I may, however, share information with government agencies or other companies assisting me in fraud prevention or investigation. I may do so when: (1) permitted or required by law; (2) trying to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorized transactions; (3) investigating fraud which has already taken place; or (4) you have given the permission to share your personal information.

Third party websites are not governed by this privacy policy and I cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information you provide to those sites. Please read their privacy statements before you use the site and/or provide any personal information.
