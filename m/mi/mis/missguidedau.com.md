Please take the time to check the details of your order at each page of the order process and before clicking “Confirm and Pay”, as you will not be able to make any changes to your order after this point. 

After you place an order by clicking “Confirm and Pay”, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received your order. We then send you an email that confirms that the Items have been despatched (“Despatch Confirmation”). 

Please note that items are subject to availability. As there is a delay between the time when the order is placed and the time when the order is processed, the stock position relating to particular items may change. If an Item becomes out of stock we will notify you as soon as possible and you will be refunded where we have already taken payment. 

We reserve the right to refuse an order for example if the Item you have ordered is unavailable or out of stock, if we are unable to obtain authorisation of payment, if there is an error in the product information including price or promotion or if we suspect fraudulent activity. 

If we are unable to supply you with an Item in these circumstances we will inform you of this by e-mail. If you have already paid for the Items, we will refund you the full amount including any delivery costs charged as soon as possible. 

The images of the Items on the Sites are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the colours accurately, we cannot guarantee that your computer's display of the colours accurately reflect the colour of the Items. Your Items may vary slightly from those images. 

All sizes and measurements of Items are approximate, however we do make every effort to ensure they are accurate as possible. 

We take all reasonable care to ensure that all details, descriptions and prices of Items are as accurate as possible. We reserve the right to refuse orders where information about Items has been mis-published, including without limitation prices and promotions.
