In order to sign up for Ambassador we require a few specific pieces of information. This information is necessary for your experience at getAmbassador.com. This information also may also be used in your user profile. 

1\. Information Collected Upon Sign Up (All Registrations)  
During the Ambassador sign up process we require 3 pieces of information: 

a. **Name** \- Your name will not be visible to anybody logged into Ambassador, it is simply used as an identifier for your custom referral URL. 

b. **Password** \- When you first create an account at Ambassador, your password is automatically generated and sent to your email. It's encrypted and then securely and privately stored away in our database. This process ensures that you are the only individual with access to your password, and therefore your Ambassador account. Because it's encrypted, even we can't see your password. You can change your password at anytime by logging in and clicking on the “Settings” tab and the “Password” tab. 

c. **Your Email Address** \- We require that you submit a valid email address during the sign up process. This requirement is set in place for security purposes and to help us better communicate with you. Ambassador may contact you with important site updates, news, information about products and services associated with Ambassador, and notifications we deem necessary. We understand that your email address is personally identifiable information and therefore promise to protect this information to the best of our abilities.
