This includes when you submit job application, admission or other forms, participate in surveys, feedback, interviews and questionnaires, visit our Websites, enter into a competition or promotion or otherwise provide us with personal information in person or via telephone, email, fax, post or other means. Generally, the kinds of personal information MBS collects include:

## 

Use and Disclosure of Your Information

###   
Use

We use your Information for the purposes for which it was provided to us, other related purposes and as permitted or required by law.  Our primary purposes for collecting, holding, and using your personal information are for research, administration and education, and for other purposes for which you have specifically provided consent. Such purposes include, but are not limited to, the following: 

  * assessing your application (i.e. for admission or employment etc.);
  * confirming your identity and establish next of kin (for emergencies);
  * communicating with you;
  * administering and facilitating the progression of an MBS course, from enquiry, application, registration, selection and admission through to completion, career/educational progression and alumni status;
  * charging course (and other) fees, offer financial support (grants, scholarships etc.) and pay wages;
  * managing the recruitment and ongoing management of executive education associates and programs;
  * creating and inform you of alumni events;
  * providing career support services;
  * conducting research investigations;
  * collecting information relating to quality and compliance issues;
  * satisfying any statutory legal obligations;
  * informing you of future activities or events and to facilitate improvements to the services provided to you; and
  * any other purposes where consent has been provided. 

For any of the above purposes we may contact you by electronic or other means.

Personal information you provide is considered a company asset and may be included among transferred assets if we merge, combine or divest part of our business unless prohibited from doing so by law.

Our primary purpose for collecting, holding and using your health information is to ensure your health and safety during your employment at MBS, participation in an MBS course or other program, or use of MBS’ facilities.

### Disclosure

We disclose your Information for the same purposes for which we collect it. That is, generally, we will only disclose your personal information for a purpose related to research, education and administration, if we have obtained your consent, or otherwise as set out in this Policy. This may include disclosing your personal information to: 

  * MBS’s insurers and professional advisors;
  * MBS’s contractors and suppliers, including IT contractors and database designers;
  * any other third parties engaged to perform functions or activities on our behalf, including direct marketing;
  * any other entity, with your consent, or to whom disclosure is required or authorised by law;
  * any other third parties engaged to perform administrative or other services.

We may also disclosure your health information to third parties including health service providers to ensure your health and safety during your employment at MBS, participation in an MBS Course or use of MBS’ facilities.

This disclosure is done on a confidential basis or otherwise in accordance with law. You should note that third parties may collect, hold, use and disclose your Information in accordance with their own privacy policies and procedures and these may be different from our own.

### Overseas Disclosure

We may disclose Information to overseas recipients for the same purposes for which we collect it. That is, for the purposes of research, administration, health and safety and education. Such disclosures are generally made to other universities or educational organisations around the world for the purpose of hosting our students as part of a student exchange or study abroad program. These recipients are located in People's Republic of China, United States of America, New Zealand & Canada but may also be located in other countries. Our contracts with these parties generally include an obligation for them to comply with an applicable law or binding scheme which effectively upholds principles for fair handling of the information that are suitably similar to the Australian Privacy Principles and the Health Privacy Principles.

We will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure transferred Information is kept secure as required by applicable data privacy laws. However, you acknowledge that, by agreeing to the disclosure of your Information to these entities outside of Australia, we will no longer be required to take reasonable steps to ensure the overseas recipient's compliance with the Australian privacy law in relation to your Information and we will not be liable to you for any breach of the Australian privacy law by these overseas recipients and, on this basis, you consent to such transfer, processing, storage and/or disclosure.

In circumstances where the provision of your Information to an overseas recipient may be deemed use rather than disclosure, we will instead comply with our use policy as outlined above. 

### Direct Marketing

We may collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information in order to inform you of products and services that may be of interest to you. In the event you do not wish to receive such communications, you can opt-out by contacting us via the contact details set out below or through any opt-out mechanism contained in a marketing communication to you.

### Security

MBS stores and holds Information electronically and/or in hard copy. We will take reasonable steps to store and hold Information in a secure and restricted manner and to protect Information from misuse, loss and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Access to your Information is limited to those individuals who require such access in order to perform their duties and responsibilities.  Any Information held by a third party storage provider is done so under a contractual obligation of confidentiality and non-disclosure.

While the Websites have secure password protections in place, you should be vigilant and note that there are inherent risks associated with transmitting Information via the internet. This means we cannot guarantee that data transmission will be 100% secure or safe from attack from unauthorised intruders and no data protection or security measure is completely secure, particularly in relation to online transmissions.  You must take care to ensure you protect your Information (for example, by protecting your usernames and passwords) and you must notify us as soon as possible after you become aware of any security breaches.

Your Information, where not stored electronically, is stored in our secure office premises with restricted access or with an offsite secure storage facility. If we no longer require the use of your Information, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify it.

### Access and Accuracy of Your Information

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the Information we collect is accurate, up to date and complete.

You have a right to access, and request the correction of, any of your Information at any time. You may also request that we delete your Information at any time. Any such requests should be made directly by contacting us at the details set out below. MBS will grant access to the extent required or authorised by the Privacy Act or other law and take steps reasonable in the circumstances to correct Information where necessary and appropriate. There may be circumstances in which we cannot provide you with access. We will advise you of the reasons if we deny you access.

### Third Party Links

The Websites may contain links to other websites of third parties. A link to a third party website is not an endorsement of the accuracy or trustworthiness of that website or its content and any information collected by such websites will be subject to that website's privacy policy. We cannot and do not assume any responsibility for the privacy or security practices of any other websites that you may be able to access through our Websites.  

Our Websites and/or any electronic methods of communication, including without limitation social media, may be accessible through or contain connections to areas where you may be able to publicly post information, communicate with others, review products and submit media content.  Prior to posting in these areas please read our Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy set out on our Websites carefully.  All the information you post may be accessible to anyone with Internet access and any Information you include in your posting may be read, collected and used by others.
