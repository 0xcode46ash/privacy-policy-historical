Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Privacy Policy  


Thank you for visiting the MBTA Web site and reviewing our Privacy Policy. Your privacy is one of our top priorities. We view this Privacy Policy as a privacy partnership between the MBTA and you, our valued customer. The following policy applies only to the use of the MBTA's Web site. Other Web sites operated have different policies. We strongly suggest that you read the privacy policies for each Web site that you visit, and any external site that you visit through a link appearing at this site. 

We seek to protect your privacy to the maximum extent possible. However, because some of the information that we receive through this Web site is subject to the Public Records Law, Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 66, Section 10, and due to the nature of Internet communications, we cannot ensure absolute privacy. Information that you provide to us through this site may be made available to members of the public under that law. This Privacy Policy is designed to explain the specific privacy protections we provide to you at our Web site. This policy informs you of the information that we collect from you at this site, what we do with it, to whom it may be disseminated, and how you can access it. Based on this information, you can make an informed choice about your use of this site. You can maximize the benefits of your privacy partnership with the MBTA by making informed choices about whether to share personally identifiable information with us through this site.

Your Choice to Participate and Your Personal Identifiable Information  
We collect no Personal Identifiable Information about you unless you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for information (i.e. sending an e-mail, participating in a survey, filling out a form, applying for employment on line or purchasing a pass, etc.). If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way effect your ability to use any other feature of the MBTA web site.   


What is "Personally Identifiable Information"?  
We use the term "personally identifiable information" to mean any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including your name, address, e-mail address, Social Security number, birth date, bank account information, credit card information, or any combination of information that could be used to identify you.   


Dissemination of Your Personally Identifiable Information  
We do not sell, trade or rent any personally identifiable information collected through this Web site. However, once you voluntarily submit personally identifiable information to us through an e-mail, its dissemination is governed by the Public Records Law, the Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 66A (Fair Information Practices Act) , Executive Order 412, and other applicable laws and regulations. For this reason, part or all of the information you send us may be provided to a member of the public in response to a public records request. However, financial information associated with your "MBTA Shop On Line" activities, such as credit information, will not be disclosed in response to a public records request.

In addition, the information that you voluntarily submit will be disclosed only to MBTA employees or officials with a "need to know" for purposes of fulfilling their job responsibilities. They will only use the information to answer your questions, respond to any requests for assistance, and fulfill the MBTA ’s legal obligations. Where appropriate, we may provide the information submitted by you to the person or company that is the subject of your inquiry, or to a government agency responsible for the matters referred to in your communication. Finally, when you request a "Shop On Line" transaction at our site, we will use the information you provide strictly for purposes of completing the transaction you have requested, and will not use this information for any other purposes. The specifics of our Policy concerning "Shop On Line" transactions may be reviewed below, in the section entitled "Privacy and Security at MBTA Shop On Line."

Information Automatically Collected and Stored by this Site  
If you do nothing during your visit to the MBTA web site but browse or download information, we automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:

The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used but not the email address   
The type of browser and operating system you used   
The date and time you visited this site   
The web pages or services you accessed at this site   
The web site you visited prior to coming to this web site

The information we automatically collect and store is used to improve the content of our web services and to help us understand how people are using our services. The MBTA analyzes our web site logs to continually improve the value of the materials available on our site. Our web site logs are not personally identifiable, and we make no attempt to link them with the individuals that browse the MBTA site. 

With this "automatically collected" information gathered in aggregate form, we may undertake or commission statistical and other summary analyses of the general behavior and characteristics of visitors at our site. Although we may share this aggregate information with third parties, rest assured that no aggregate information we provide to third parties will allow anyone to identify you, or determine anything personal about you. 

Information Voluntarily Provided by You.   
If during your visit to the MBTA you voluntary participate in such activities including, but limited to, sending e-mail, participating in a survey, filling out a form, applying for employment on line or purchasing a pass on line, the following additional personally identifiable information will be collected:

1.The e-mail address and contents of the e-mail  
2\. Information volunteered as responses

Access and Correction of Personal Identifiable Information  
The Public Records Law and the Fair Information Practices Act provide you certain rights to get information about you that is in our records. To learn more about the circumstances under which you can get and correct this information, please click on the above references to these laws.

You may review any personal information we collect about you. You may recommend changes to your personal information where you believe there are errors, by submitting a written request that credibly shows the error. If you believe that your personal information is being used for a purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact us. In all cases, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. See Who and How to Contact the MBTA section. 

Security Protections at the MBTA Web Site  
The MBTA has taken several steps to safeguard the integrity of its telecommunications and computing infrastructure, including but not limited to authentication, monitoring, auditing, and encryption. Security measures have been integrated into the design, implementation and day-to-day practices of the entire information environment as part of a commitment to quality control.

Because this site does not encrypt incoming e-mail, you should not send information that you consider highly sensitive through this Web site. We use standard security measures to minimize the threat that your personally identifiable information will be lost, misused, altered, or unintentionally destroyed. We also use software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. 

This information should not be construed in any way as giving business, legal, or other advice, or warranting as fail proof, the security of information provided by or submitted to the MBTA web site.

Privacy and Security at MBTA Shop On Line  
When you order a monthly pass or ticket through our site, we will collect the following information to properly complete your order: your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, shipping information and credit card information. We use a reputable company to verify your credit card information before billing your account. We will also share your shipping information with the delivery service you request (either the U.S. Postal Service, United Parcel Service, or other delivery companies you select).

Our orders are processed through a secured server using advanced forms of encryption software. This means that all of your personal information including credit card number, name, and address will be encrypted to minimize the possibility that the information (if intercepted) it can be read as it travels over the Internet. Your credit card numbers are processed only by a third party credit card vendor and do not reside on the MBTA servers. 

Privacy Protection for Children  
Our Site is not directed at children, and we will not accept or request personal information from individuals we know to be under 13.

Changes to Policy  
We will post changes to this policy at least 10 days before they take effect. Any information we collect under the current privacy policy will remain subject to the terms of this policy. After any changes take effect, all new information we collect, if any, will be subject to the new policy.

Disclaimer Notice  
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) makes no claims, promises or guarantees about the accuracy, currency, completeness, or adequacy of the contents of this website and expressly disclaims liability for errors and omissions in its contents. In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Public Records Act or other law governing the disclosure of records, the Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.

No warranty of any kind, implied, express or statutory, including but not limited to the warranties of non-infringement of third party rights, title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and freedom from computer virus, is given with respect to this website or its links to other Internet resources. Although we have put in place security systems (as described in this Policy) that are designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of your personally identifiable information, due to the nature of Internet technologies we cannot provide firm assurances as to the security of this information, and expressly disclaim any such obligation.

Site Privileges  
You agree to refrain from activity that imposes an unreasonable burden on the Site, and we reserve the right, in our discretion, to limit the order quantity on any item and /or to refuse service to any customer who violates these provisions.

Choice of Law and Jurisdiction  
This Site is controlled and operated by the MBTA from its location in Boston, Massachusetts. This Policy shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to any conflict of law provisions. Any dispute arising under this Policy shall be resolved exclusively by the state or federal courts sitting in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

Exceptions

Cookies  
The MBTA web site uses "cookies". Cookies are files that a Web site can place on your computer. A cookie file contains unique information that a Web site can use to track such things as your password, lists of Web pages you have visited, and the date when you last looked at a specific Web page, to identify your session at a particular Web site or to hold information in your shopping cart. A cookie file allows the Web site to recognize you as you click through pages on the site and when you later revisit the site. A Web site can use cookies to "remember" your preferences, and to record your browsing behavior on the Web. Although you can prevent Web sites from placing cookies on your computer by using your browser's preference menu, disabling cookies may affect your ability to view or interact with some Web sites. On the MBTA web site our cookies only store whether you are in "Text Only" mode or not. We do not use cookies for tracking purposes.

An "Internet Protocol Address" or "IP Address"  
This refers to a series of numbers that identifies each computer and machine connected to the Internet. An IP address enables a server on a computer network to send you the file that you have requested on the Internet. The IP address disclosed to us might identify the computer from which you are accessing the Internet, or a server owned by your Internet Service Provider. Because it is machine-specific, rather than person-specific, an IP address is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable information.
