**Privacy Statement**

This is the privacy statement of MBNA America Bank, N.A., and its affiliated companies located in the United States for individual consumers.

**Customer Privacy Is Important to Us**

At MBNA, we are committed to providing our Customers with the finest products backed by consistently top-quality service. And while information is fundamental to our ability to do this, we fully recognize the importance of keeping our Customers' personal and account information secure.

  * We protect Customer information from unauthorized access, using established and exacting security standards.
  * We actively seek to verify the identity of our Customers through the use of personal passwords or other information before assisting them.
  * We take vigilant fraud protection measures (including holding Customer Personal Identification Numbers [PINs] in the strictest confidence) in order to protect our Customers around the clock from fraud.
  * We collect and use Customer information—information from applications and from account usage, as well as information derived from other sources—to the extent needed to conduct our business and to meet the highest quality service standards.
  * We allow others to offer their products and services to our Customers when we think our Customers may find these products and services to be of value. When we share Customer information with them, we require them to protect this information as we would and we audit their activities to ensure that they do.
  * We require any organization that helps us serve our Customers to meet our privacy standards.
  * We exchange Customer information, to the extent permissible by law, for the purposes of credit reporting, verification, and risk management.

**Web Site Privacy**

This Web site is published by MBNA America Bank, N.A., the principal subsidiary of MBNA Corporation, 1100 North King Street, Wilmington, DE 19884. MBNA is at your service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year at 1-800-421-2110.

The MBNA Web server automatically recognizes and records the domain name from which you access the Internet and the names of the pages you visited while at our site. It does not, however, store your electronic mail address (unless you choose to provide that to us). The information gathered may be used to improve the content of the MBNA Web site and make it more useful.

Information you supply to MBNA via the Internet, such as postal addresses or telephone numbers, may be used for marketing and research and development purposes.

**Gathering Information**

We obtain information about applicants and Customers from applications, transactions and other experiences with us, and credit reporting agencies and other third parties (such as employment references). We will only obtain this information in accordance with applicable law and in response to your request for an account with us or for another legitimate business purpose. The information we gather helps us identify who you are, manage our relationship with our Customers, and develop products and services that meet the needs of our Customers. 

**Sharing Information Among MBNA-Affiliated Companies**

To help us and our affiliated companies serve you better and to enable us to continue to offer you the finest products, we share information about you and your accounts with each other.

You may request that information about you not be shared among our affiliated companies, other than information pertaining solely to transactions or experiences between you and us (or any MBNA affiliate), by writing to us at MBNA, Affiliate Information Sharing, P. O. Box 15342, Wilmington, DE 19850-5342. Please print clearly and include your full name, your address, and all your MBNA account numbers. Do not include any other kind of correspondence in the envelope. Please allow approximately 10 weeks for your request to take effect.

**Sharing Information with Third Parties**

We're dedicated to serving our Customers' needs—for privacy as well as for programs that they may find valuable. From time to time, we may allow nonaffiliated companies to offer our Customers products and services that may not be account-related, but that we have determined to be of particular value to our Customers. If you, as a Customer, wish to be taken off marketing lists we provide to these companies, send your request to MBNA, Third-Party Information Sharing, P.O. Box 17018, Wilmington, DE 19850-7018. Please print clearly and include your full name and address and the applicable MBNA account numbers. Do not include any other kind of correspondence in the envelope. Please allow approximately 10 weeks for your request to take effect. Also, please be aware that this request will not affect your eligibility to receive information that is sent to you by us.

**Sharing Information with Credit Reporting Agencies**

We also share information with credit reporting agencies, just as other financial institutions do. From time to time, you may want to check on the accuracy of your credit report. If you believe that inaccurate or incomplete information about you or your account has been shared by us with a credit reporting agency, write to us at MBNA, Credit Reporting Agencies, P.O. Box 15026, Wilmington, DE 19850-5026. Please include your name, address, home phone number, and account number, and explain which information you believe is inaccurate or incomplete.
