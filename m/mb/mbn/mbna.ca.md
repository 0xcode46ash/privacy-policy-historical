# MBNA CANADA - Privacy Policy Statement

  
Your privacy is important to us

At MBNA Canada Bank ("MBNA"), we are committed to providing you with the finest financial products and services backed by consistently top-quality service. And while information about you is fundamental to our ability to do this, we fully recognize the importance of keeping personal information secure. 

To offer you the widest range of products and services, MBNA may share information about you both within MBNA and outside of MBNA with other companies. This allows us to offer you products and services that may interest you and best meet your needs, whether they are available directly from MBNA or through our relationships with other companies. We want you to understand our information safeguards, what information we collect, what information we share, and the benefits you receive when we share information about you. 

This notice describes the privacy practices of MBNA for financial products and services governed by the laws of Canada. This notice also explains MBNA's practices regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information and lets you choose whether or not MBNA may share certain information about you, either within MBNA or outside of MBNA with other companies. 

**Security Safeguards**

MBNA understands the importance of protecting and securing information and using it appropriately. Access to information about you is restricted to the People of MBNA requiring it to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable law. 

When MBNA shares information about you with a company outside of MBNA, we require them to impose safeguards, use it only for a permitted purpose, and to return it to us or destroy it once that purpose is served. We limit the amount of information shared to what is necessary to offer a product or service efficiently. MBNA requires any company receiving information from MBNA to sign a Confidentiality Agreement containing these requirements and obligating the company to protect the information as we would. 

**Information We Collect**

MBNA collects and uses information about you only to the extent required to conduct our business and to consistently deliver the top-quality Customer service you expect from us. Sources of information include: 

  * Information we receive from you on applications and other forms or through your correspondence or communication with us including through the mail, by telephone or over the Internet; 
  * Information about your transactions with MBNA and with other companies outside of MBNA; and 
  * Information we receive from third parties such as consumer reporting agencies, to verify statements you've made to us or regarding your employment, credit or other relationships. 



**Information We Share within MBNA**

We may share any of the information we collect about you within MBNA to offer additional products or services that may interest you and best meet your needs. We believe this is more convenient for you and may save you both time and money. The decision to purchase any such products or services is yours alone. We may partner with other organizations in offering additional products or services. 

**Information We Share With Others**

We may share all the information we collect with companies that perform marketing or other services on our behalf, with companies assisting us in servicing your loan or account, to government entities in response to subpoenas or regulatory requirements, or to consumer reporting agencies. 

From time-to-time, we may also work with companies outside of MBNA to offer you products and services that we've determined may be of interest to you including financial service companies such as insurance providers and non-financial companies such as card registry services. In order to ensure that you receive only those offers that are of greatest interest to you, we may share some or all of the information we have collected with these third party companies as outlined in the "security safeguards" section. 

**Important Information About Your Choice**

We disclose information about you only in accordance with law and to the extent required to conduct our business. This allows us to offer you a greater variety of products and services and to consistently deliver the top-quality service you expect from MNBA, in addition to saving you time and money. We fully recognize the importance of keeping personal information secure. 

We're dedicated to serving your needs - and your choices related to privacy. You may direct MBNA not to share information about you, either within MBNA or with other companies outside of MBNA (other than disclosures permitted or required by law). You may also notify us if you do not wish to receive any further marketing materials. However, if you should withdraw your consent to our use or ability to collect and report credit information on you to and from consumer reporting agencies, you do so on the understanding that we may no longer be able to extend credit to you. We will continue to report the status of your account to credit reporting agencies until your account has been finally settled. If you wish to opt out of such information sharing, please write to us at: MBNA Canada, Privacy Office, P.O. Box 9660, Station T, Ottawa, Ontario K1C 6M9. We will ask you to verify your identity and the specific accounts to which the opt out applies. MBNA will continue to adhere to the privacy practices described in this notice even if you become an inactive Customer or if you close your accounts. 

Please remember that your choices regarding MBNA's information sharing practices are maintained by MBNA unless you revoke them in writing. 

**Requesting Your Information**

In accordance with applicable Federal law, upon written request, you are entitled to be informed of the existence, use and disclosure of your personal information. To make such a request, please write to us at address noted above. Please note that an approximate cost of $25.00 applies to all such requests. 

This notice updates and replaces any previous notices from MBNA about the privacy, security and protection of information.
