# Privacy Policy | MBA Focus | MBAFocus.com

MBA Focus knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. We use the information that you provide only for the purpose of providing and distributing our MBA recruitment products & services. Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we never give or sell the information to other individuals or organizations.

When MBA Focus collects personal information from you on our website, we follow industry-standard privacy principles. MBA Focus complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. MBA Focus has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view MBA Focus’ certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

These are our promises to you:

  * 1\. Notice. As a candidate or employer, you opt-in to utilize our services. We collect personal information from candidates for employment purposes only, and the only data that we capture is profile information and your CV/resume as submitted by you.
  * 2\. Choice. We’ll give you choices about the ways we use and share your personal information, and we’ll respect the choices you make. MBA student and alumni information remains the property of our partner institutions. The school retains final approval over which hiring organizations may or may not access their student data. MBA Focus will distribute this information only in the context of providing MBA recruitment products and services, and only when the partner school approves such distribution.
  * 3\. Onward Transfer. MBA Focus has been in the MBA Recruitment business since 2003 and has earned the trust of the world’s top schools and hiring organizations. If information will be disclosed to a 3rd party, that 3rd party must also adhere to the Safe Harbor principles, and you will be given appropriate Notice and Choice as described in the two points above.
  * 4\. Access. We’ll provide ways for you to access your personal information, as required by law, so you can correct inaccuracies and amend your information.
  * 5\. Security. We’ll take appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
  * 6\. Accuracy and Data Integrity. We’ll collect only as much personal information as is needed for recruitment purposes, and we won’t use your data for other purposes. We’ll take appropriate steps to make sure the personal information in our records is accurate and complete.
  * 7\. Enforcement. We’ll regularly review how we’re meeting these privacy promises, and we’ll provide an independent way for you to resolve complaints about our privacy practices.
