**Privacy Policy**

This is how we handle the information we learn from you when you visit The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center web site (www.mdanderson.org). The information we receive depends on what you do during your visit.

  * the date and time you access our service; 
  * the pages you visit; 
  * the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to us. 
  * the name and release number of web browser software you are using. 



This information is collected automatically and is not linked to your personal identity. It is used in an aggregate way to help us improve our web site and make it more useful to you. We do not use cookies to collect information. 

**Online Forms & Email Communication

You should note that electronic mail and other Internet communications channels are not necessarily secure against interception.
