Our Site may use cookies to enhance your experience while using our Site. Cookies are pieces of information that some web Sites transfer to the computer that is browsing that web Site and are used for record-keeping purposes at many web Sites. Use of cookies makes web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords, your personal preferences regarding your use of the particular web site and to make sure you don’t see the same ad repeatedly.
