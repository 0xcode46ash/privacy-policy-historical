# Privacy Policy | Medidata Solutions

Medidata Solutions, Inc. ("Medidata" or "We") have created this Privacy Policy to explain why we collect particular information and how we will protect your personal privacy within our Website. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the website(s) located at the URLs [www.medidatasolutions.com](http://www.medidatasolutions.com/) and [www.mdsol.com](https://www.mdsol.com/en), or any successor Site (collectively, the "Website" or "Site"). Medidata reserves the right to change this policy at any time by posting a new privacy policy at this location. Therefore, you are responsible for periodically checking the Privacy Policy for changes.  
 

## Safe Harbor

Medidata complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. MissionMode has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement. Learn more about the [Safe Harbor program and view Medidata's certification](http://export.gov/safeharbor/index.asp).

Medidata has selected a third party to serve as its independent recourse mechanism (IRM) for dispute resolution. The EU Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) will be used for dispute resolution which will be available to investigate unresolved complaints involving “human resources data”. In addition, the DPA and the FDPIC will be used to resolve all other disputes and to investigate unresolved complaints involving other types of data (e.g., client and customer data).

If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Medidata, you may contact either the [EU DPAs panel](mailto:ec-dppanel-secr@ec.europa.eu) or individual [EU DPAs](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/eu/index_en.htm) or the [Swiss FDPIC](http://www.edoeb.admin.ch/kontakt/index.html?lang=en).
