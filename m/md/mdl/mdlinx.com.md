# M3 USA - Privacy Policy

The privacy of our users on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Since M3 USA Corporation ("M3"), its related network of sites and services (including the MDLinx.com site, its speciality sites, thesmartestoncologist.com site and any similar M3 sites, (all such sites collectively the "Sites")) do gather certain types of information about our users, we feel that you should completely understand the conditions and terms surrounding the gathering and use of information about those using our sites and services. This Privacy Policy Statement divulges what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. In the policy, the pronouns "you" and "your" are used to refer to the end user, while "we," "us" and "our" are used to refer to M3. 

By visiting one of the Sites, or by using a Site's services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy Statement. We may amend this Statement at any time; if we make changes to our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. This Statement was last revised on **October 1, 2009**. Any questions regarding our Privacy Policy Statement should be directed to M3 ([support@mdlinx.com](mailto:support@mdlinx.com)) for clarification and further elaboration. 

### 1\. Collecting Information

M3 gathers and tracks information/data that users provide through registration on our Sites for some services. In addition to this gathering of information by the registration of users, M3 also gathers information through tracking systems depending on the service being used by you. The tracking systems include deriving data by tallying page views throughout our Sites and capturing information on the type of browser being used to view the Site, tracking what pages you have visited while on the Site and in market research studies tracking what computers respond to a survey. This information enables us to better provide content and to respond to our users' needs. It also is used to help our advertisers and sponsors to better understand the demographics of our audience (solely on an aggregate basis). As M3 derives its revenue mainly from advertising on our Sites, it is necessary for us to provide such aggregated demographic data to our sponsors and advertisers; this allows us to keep our services free to users. M3 does not divulge any personal information about an individual user to any third party except in the case of a market research study, where your identity or an identifier unique to you may be disclosed but will not be linked to the answers you provided, or if you specifically opt-in to participate in a Messages series from a sponsor, in which case your name, specialty and the answers you provide will be made available to such sponsor, except that your name may be displayed on certain Sites relating to quiz programs. 

M3 may gather information on our users in the following ways:

#### Registration

Some services require user registration. For the registration process, we may require some information, like name, email address, zip code and profession, while other information requested will be voluntary and optional. Information collected in the registration process is never shared with third parties in a personally identifiable way without your permission (for example if you choose to participate in a market research study or opt-in to participate in a Messages series from a sponsor), except for the display of your name on certain quiz Sites. 

#### Electronic Newsletters

The MDLinx sites offer free electronic newsletters to users, providing specific information to them on the appropriate topics. To provide these services, we must gather the email addresses of users who register for and voluntarily subscribe to said services. You may remove yourself from an MDLinx mailing list at any time by following the instructions provided at the end of every newsletter. 

#### Emails

By registering with our Sites you agree that we may send you emails regarding information specific to such Site, surveys or opportunities involving other M3 services and Sites. To provide these services, we must gather the email addresses of users who register for said Site. You may remove yourself from these mailing lists at any time by terminating the service. 

#### Market Research Studies

Users of the Sites may elect to participate in market research surveys that the M3 runs from time to time. These studies are intended to give specific anonymous feedback to third parties. This feedback, while shared in the format it was collected, will not be shared in manner that is correlated to your personally identifiable information used to pay honoraria for your time. All participants may be disclosed to such third parties by a unique identifier but such identifier will not be associated with any specific feedback. 

#### Discussion Lists

Users of discussion lists must subscribe to them separately. Subscribing to any of our free email newsletters does not also subscribe users to affiliated discussion lists. A user must register for this free service and must agree to the terms and conditions of the service. You may remove yourself from a discussion list at any time by following the instructions provided. 

#### Usage Tracking

M3 uses traffic analysis software on our servers to track user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. M3 uses this data to break down overall usage statistics according to IP address, domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the data automatically sent by the browser whenever a web page is requested. Additionally, solely in connection with your voluntarily participation in a market research study, your computer may be tracked by digital fingerprinting or watermarking to help ensure unique responders to a survey. 

#### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that resides only on your own computer and that can be accessed only by the server that originally created the cookie. A cookie cannot store or send back any information to us that you have not specifically and voluntarily provided while on a Site, or that is not among the information mentioned above that is contained in every user's browser (i.e., domain name, browser type). We use cookies only so that we may tally the number of unique users who visit our sites, and potentially to permit greater personalization of the site to your preferences and specifications. Even when you may have provided to us information that is stored in a cookie on your computer, we will not share personally identifiable information about you to third parties. 

#### Industry Sponsored Programs

You may be offered the opportunity to participate in special programs from advertisers, such as a Message series from an industry sponsor. At the time of opting-in to any such program, you will be notified if your information may be shared with the sponsor in connection with such program. For most Messages series, members who opt in agree that their name, specialty, the messages they read and their answers to questions they elect to respond to can be shared with the industry sponsor. Members who opt-in to these programs may opt-out at any time by following the instructions provided, such as by 'denying' the rep on their Messages tab. 

### 2\. Sharing of the information

We use the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs, help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics and help ensure the integrity of market research studies. This is essential to keeping our services free. We do not share information about an individual user's identity with any third party except (a) as noted above to the extent you have voluntarily agreed to participate in a market research study or other sponsored program (such as a Messages series), (b) as necessary to comply with applicable legal requirements; provided that to the extent you are a leader of a quiz program, your name may be listed on the leader board.   
Please note that we do not control the practices of the advertisers on their sites. When you click on links and/or ad banners that take you to third-party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies. We encourage you to read the posted privacy policy statement whenever interacting with any web site. If you have questions about how one of our advertisers uses information about you when you click their ad, visit their site, and view their content, please contact them directly. 

### 3\. "No-spam" policy

Your email address will not be sold to a third party if you sign up for one of our email newsletters, market research programs, discussion lists or quiz programs. If you sign up for an email newsletter or discussion list at an MDLinx Site, you will receive only the email newsletter or discussion list you have requested. You may receive on occasion an offer from us to sign up for a new newsletter, discussion list or quiz program, or information about other M3 services, but you will not receive additional newsletters or discussion list mailings unless you specifically have requested them or have otherwise opted in for third-party announcements (see Opt-in Announcement List Privacy Policy below). 

### 4\. Delete/deactivate policy

Users may unsubscribe to any of our electronic newsletters or discussion lists at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every newsletter or discussion list, and also on the Sites. If you no longer wish to use any of our services or receive any information from us, you may request to have your personal information removed from our databases by sending a request via email (support@mdlinx.com) or by fax (202-293-1690), including your first and last names and email address with which you originally registered. Changes or corrections to your information may be submitted in the same fashion. 

### Opt-in Announcement List Privacy Policy

When you register for our services you may be given the option of joining an opt-in list. If you choose to sign up, you will receive information or participate in campaigns relevant to the specialty you selected from select third parties who have entered into agreements with us. You may have your email address removed from our opt-in announcement lists at any time by deselecting the opt-in list option. M3 is not responsible for the content of emails you may receive when you have elected to opt-in to a particular opt-in list.
