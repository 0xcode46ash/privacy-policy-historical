# Website Policies & Notices | MCC | Washington, DC

#### Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) website and reviewing our Privacy Policy. This policy describes how we handle the personal information you provide to us via our web page and online forms.

Federal law requires us to tell you how we collect, use, share, and protect your personal information. Federal law also limits how we can use your personal information.

Personal information may include your name; email, home, and/or business address; phone numbers; Social Security Number; Passport Number; or other information that identifies you personally.

##### Information Collection and Use

If you visit our site to read or download information, such as country information about one of our projects, we collect general log information but do not collect personal information.

General log information collected may include, but is not limited to:

  * Internet Domain (e.g. “yourcompany.com” or “youruniversity.edu”) 
  * Internet Protocol (IP) address 
  * Operating System 
  * Brower used to access the site (e.g. MS Explorer, Safari, Firefox) 
  * Date & Time of access 
  * Pages viewed upon visit 



We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, find out what information is most viewed, and to help us make our website more useful to our visitors.

Except for oversight, law enforcement investigations, or protection of the MCC information technology infrastructure as authorized by law, we make no other attempts to identify you or your usage habits.

We use general logs for no other purposes than the purposes described above, and we regularly destroy these logs in accordance with General Records Schedules published by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and agency record control schedule requirements.

If you leave a comment or utilize one of our online forms and voluntarily provide your personal information, we will only utilize the information you provide to respond to you or process your request.

##### Use of Cookies and Tracking Technologies

In general, our website does not use “cookies” that many websites use to gather and store information about your visits to their sites.

There are two common kinds of Cookies:

  * A _Session Cookie_ is a line of text that is stored temporarily in your computer’s random access memory (RAM). A session cookie is destroyed as soon as you close your browser. 
  * A _Persistent Cookie_ is a line of text that is saved to a file on your hard drive and is called up the next time you visit that website. This lets the website remember information about your previous visits and use of the website. 



Persistent cookies are not used by MCC or other Federal government websites, unless there is a compelling and authorized reason for their use. If any MCC web page uses a Persistent Cookie, then the Privacy Policy for that Web page will clearly state the purpose and legal authority for such use.

Please be aware that some of the links on the MCC website may point you to a non‐MCC site that may place persistent cookies on your computer. You can expect to be notified that you are leaving the MCC site when you select one of these links.

For more information on how to “opt-out” of cookies, please view the following detailed page on USA.Gov: <http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml>

We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personal information to outside marketers or third parties. Information collected via the MCC website may be shared with employees, contractors, and other service providers (such as other U.S. Government agencies) only as necessary to respond to a request, provide a service, or as otherwise authorized by law.

MCC links to other U.S. Government websites (domain names usually ending in “.gov”) and private organizations that we believe are relevant to our mission (domain names usually ending in “.edu,” “.com,” etc.). Once you connect with one of these linked sites, you are subject to the disclaimers, security, and privacy policies of that site.
