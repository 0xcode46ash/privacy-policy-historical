The submission of Personal Information is voluntary. However, you may not be able to access certain services or features on our Site unless you register and provide such Personal Information. For example, you cannot participate in our sweepstakes without providing us certain Personal Information that we need to conduct that promotion.

We may use the Personal Information we collect in the following ways:

An IP address is associated with the access point through which you enter the Internet, and is typically controlled by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or your company. We may collect this non-personal information to improve the quality of the Site and the products and services offered through the Site.

We store personal and other information we collect through the Site on servers located in the United States. By providing us your Personal Information you consent to its transfer to the United States.

#### When and to whom do we disclose Personal Information?

  * We may disclose Personal Information where you have specifically authorized us to do so in connection with registering at our Site or in some other written communication;
  * We may disclose Personal Information if required by law, court, and administrative agency order, subpoena, or other legal action, or by law enforcement;

On occasion, we contract with trusted third party providers who would receive your Personal Information to perform certain services on our behalf. Through our contractual arrangements, we require our contracting partners to maintain adequate security of Personal Information provided to them. We do not permit such third parties to sell your Personal Information to other third parties, however such third parties may share non-personally identifiable aggregate data (such as user demographics, website activity, purchase history, and other statistical information) and de-identified individual data and profiles with third parties for market research and other purposes. Here are some of the third parties that we use to provide services:

  * We use Zipscene LLC to help us operate our website and administer various activities. To learn more about how Zipscene LLC uses information you provide to our Site, please visit zipscene.com/privacy.
