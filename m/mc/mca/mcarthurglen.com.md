### IP Protocol (IP) Addresses

When you access the Internet using your computer, your Internet service provider assigns you an IP Address. Generally, every time you connect to the Internet, your IP Address changes. In some circumstances (i.e. with some broadband connections) your IP Address may not change in which case it can be associated with your particular computer and may therefore amount to personal information. Examples of the type of information that can be collected using your IP Address include your type of Internet Browser and the type of computer operating system you are using. McArthurGlen UK Limited, or its authorized agents, use your IP Address to collect and report aggregate information on how the website is being used and ways in which the website can be improved.

### Web Log Information

Web log information is non-personal information that is collected by the computer that hosts the website (the "Website Server") when you visit the website, including, but not limited to, the date and time you visited the website, the type of Internet Browser you are using and the type of computer operating system you are using. Web log information may be collected and used by McArthurGlen UK Limited or its authorized agents in aggregate to assess how the website is being used and how to improve the website.

### Passive Information Collection

As you navigate through the website, certain information may be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies and navigational data collection. A ‘cookie’ is a bit of information that a web site sends to your web browser that helps the site

remember information about you and your preferences. This website uses ‘session’ cookies. Session cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser window or otherwise turn your computer off. Session cookies are used to improve navigation on web sites and to collect aggregate statistical information. This Website collects aggregate statistical information for internal purposes only. This information will only be used internally by McArthurGlen UK Limited for statistical market data collection. No statistical information will be provided to third parties or outside sources. If you do not want your usage to be tracked in this way please email us at **[marketing@mcarthurglen.com](mailto:marketing@mcarthurglen.com "marketing@mcarthurglen.com")**. This website also uses ‘persistent’ cookies. ‘Persistent’ cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (e.g. login passwords), helping to determine which areas of the website you find most valuable and customising the website based on your preferences.
