  2. How we use the information

**What Information We Collect**  
We collect and store some or all of the following information about our users: name; email address; and billing information, such as address, phone number and credit card number. If you do not wish to have your credit card number stored, please contact [Customer Support](http://us.mcafee.com/root/support.asp). We also receive and may store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses www.mcafee.com. More information on our use of "cookies" can be found below. 

In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, experience with our products, and more detailed contact preferences. Customers and visitors always have the option of choosing not to provide us with this information. 

**Web Applications**  
We may also employ certain applications, such as the various components of Security Center, to retrieve information about your computer system to assist us in the provision of services that you have chosen to subscribe to or use. This information is essential to enable us to provide you with quality service, and for that reason there is no opt-out available for this information collection. 

**Use of Data**  
McAfee Consumer uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, including fulfillment of orders and promotional offers, to communicate back to you, to update you on service and benefits, to personalize our Web sites for you, and to manage and renew your subscription(s). Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and fraud protection, and are not used for other purposes without your permission. 

**Use of Your Email Address**  
If you provide us with your email address when you register as a customer or make a purchase from us, we may occasionally send you email with recommendations or notices of new products, prices, and services. This email may include paid advertisements from third parties. At the time you register or make a purchase, you will be given the opportunity **to opt into our out of** this service. If you do not initially choose to opt out, you may still block future email of this type, simply by following the unsubscribe instructions that accompany all such communications. 

Separately, we send service notifications via email to keep you informed about the status of your service orders or accounts and to provide updates and technical notices. These messages are essential to the maintenance of your subscription and the functionality of our services. Therefore there is no opt-out available for service notifications and these messages cannot be blocked. 

**Who We Share It With**  
McAfee Consumer will not sell, rent, or lease your personally information to others. 

We may share the personal information you provide online with other Network Associates entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf, but only for the uses already described in "Use of Data." More information on business partners with whom we may share your information is provided below under "Special Relationships." 

For advertising purposes, visitor and customer information is statistically aggregated and reported to advertisers. However, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you, such as your name, email address, account, password, or transaction history. 

**Special Relationships**  
Network Associates and McAfee Consumer have a number of relationships with business partners with whom we may share your personal information for the purpose of providing a service, fulfilling an order or completing a transaction. For example, we use certain vendors for the purpose of providing credit card transaction and check processing services. These vendors verify your purchase information, such as credit card number or checking account number, and authorize your transaction. In doing so, they have access to data about users, but they are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose. 

**Digital River** powers the McAfee Store, and in doing so collects information about users, including credit card information. When a user purchases a product from the McAfee Store powered by Digital River, information about the customer and the purchase are shared with McAfee Consumer. As of May 2003, when a customer purchases a subscription Digital River shares credit card information with McAfee Consumer so that McAfee consumer can maintain and renew the subscription. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and fraud protection, and are not used for other purposes without your permission. Digital River may occasionally notify you of special offers, new products, services, promotions, and other similar information on behalf of McAfee Consumer. McAfee Consumer users can opt out of receiving such mail from Digital River by calling 1-800-656-5426 and asking to be removed from future emails.
