# Privacy Policy

**The Beyond.com Privacy Policy**

Beyond.com is committed to protecting your privacy. To make your shopping experience more convenient, we gather information from you. We maintain the privacy of your information using security technologies and adhere to policies that prevent unauthorized use of your personal information. 

**What information does Beyond.com collect and how is it used?**

To process and fulfill your order, we need to know your name, email address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. After giving us this information, you can use our Quick Buy feature, which saves you from completing the order form more than once. 

We might request additional information from you in the future. You may choose not to provide this information; although, some products and services might not be available to you unless you provide the additional information. We might also ask for information about your interests or for feedback about our site so that we can tailor your shopping experience to improve our site and service. Providing us with this information is always optional. 

When you submit a customer review, we ask for your email address so other customers have additional information about who wrote the review. You can choose not to have your email address display with your review. 

In addition to the information we collect directly from you, we also monitor and track usage of our website, viewing and traffic patterns, customer behavior, and other similar information. We compile this information into a statistical aggregate. We use this aggregate information as well as all of your personal information for internal business and administrative purposes including to improve our website, our product and service offerings, our operations, and our customer service. We also might use your personal information from time to time to send you notices about special offers, new products, services, promotions, and other similar information. 

**Does Beyond.com disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**

We do provide your name, address, and email address to the publishers of downloadable software whose products you buy so that you can automatically be registered and notified of product updates, upgrades, and special pricing on future products. In the future, we might choose to sell, trade, or rent online customer information to trustworthy parties; but you can tell us not to by sending an email message to [neversell@beyond.com](mailto:neversell@beyond.com). Please include your email address and the words "never sell" in the subject or content field so that we can process your request promptly. We do provide aggregate information about site usage and traffic patterns, stripped of any individual identification, to third parties to comply with various reporting obligations and for business or marketing purposes. 

**How does Beyond.com protect customer information?**

When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server that encrypts all your personal information before it is sent to us to prevent unauthorized access to your information. We also offer the option of placing a credit card order over the phone. 

**What are Cookies?**

Beyond.com uses a feature of your Internet browser called a "cookie" to assign a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. These files allow you to easily access your customer data on our site. They also save you time by tracking your order information so that you do not have to re-enter this information upon every visit. Beyond.com does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer unless you knowingly provided such information. 

**Beyond.com Privacy Policy Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post these changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. 

If you have further questions regarding our privacy practices, please send email to [support@beyond.com](mailto:support@beyond.com).
