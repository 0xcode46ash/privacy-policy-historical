This privacy policy generally explains the type of information we collect through our websites and how we use that information. PLEASE NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE STUDENT INFORMATION FURNISHED THROUGH THE SITES, OR BY ANY OTHER MEANS, IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES PROVIDED TO OUR CUSTOMERS. SUCH PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IS GOVERNED BY A SEPARATE POLICY. 

INFORMATION COLLECTION  
At the Sites, we offer you the opportunity to request information about our products, programs and services. We also allow visitors to submit by e-mail resume information in connection with our employment opportunities, and to request by e-mail information about becoming a publishing partner. We may also collect the following types of personally identifiable information through the Sites: the e-mail address of visitors, user-specific information regarding what pages visitors access or visit and other information that visitors to the Sites may submit, such as registration information. 

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows 2000 or Mac OS), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online or Earthlink) and your computer’s IP address. 

HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION  
We use this information to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and other questions or comments you submit to us. We also may use the personally identifiable information that we collect to offer you other products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. 

We may use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage. 

We do not normally use IP addresses to identify individual users, but may do so if we feel that there are or may be safety and/or security risks. We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20041010081355id_/http%3A//www.wirelessgeneration.com/web/terms_conditions.html), or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Wireless Generation. 

CHOICES/OPT-OUT  
As noted above, Wireless Generation may contact you to provide you with opportunities to purchase products or services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive marketing information from this site or that we not share your information with any third party, just let us know by sending us an e-mail at [privacy@wirelessgeneration.com](mailto:privacy@wirelessgeneration.com). COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY OTHERS  
The Sites contain links to third-party websites (e.g., to our publishing partners’ websites) whose information practices may be different than ours. This privacy policy does not apply to websites of any other company or organization linked to a WG Site. You should consult the other sites’ privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. SECURITY  
We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online. CONTACT US
