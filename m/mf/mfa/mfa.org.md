The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, (MFA), is committed to protecting your privacy when you visit our Web site, shop at the MFA Online Store, use the Web site to purchase tickets or an MFA membership, or make an online donation. The MFA does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals (“Personal Information”), such as names and mailing or e-mail addresses, unless the individual visiting the MFA Web site or Online Store (collectively referred to as the "MFA Web Site") knowingly provides it. By using the MFA Web Site, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of MFA's Privacy Policy. By providing Personal Information, you consent to our collection and use of it, as described in this Privacy Policy. The MFA Privacy Policy governs our use and disclosure of Personal Information collected only through the MFA Web Site. The MFA Privacy Policy is outlined below.

You may decide whether or not you wish to complete such surveys, which may ask about your background, occupation, or similar questions. We use this information to help us better understand our visitors needs and interests, which in turn allows us to better meet your expectations.

2\. How the MFA Uses Information Provided by Visitors  
 _Use of Personal Information_  
The MFA uses the Personal Information you provide to us for internal purposes, such as filling and tracking your purchase, analyzing trends and collecting statistics. The MFA may also compile and provide aggregate statistics about our visitors, customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to third parties, but these statistics will not include any personally identifying information. 

We do not make your Personal Information available to third parties except as permitted by this Privacy Policy. We may contact you to inform you of an event or promotion that we believe would interest you. You may opt out of receiving such communications from the MFA by contacting us at mfamail@mfa.org. The MFA may disclose Personal Information when such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law; enforce the terms of any of our user agreements; or protect the rights, property, and safety of MFA, the users of its site, or others. 

We may combine information you give to us online, in our stores or at the Museum. We may also combine this information with publicly available information and information we received from or cross-reference with our third-party vendors and others. We use this combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about products or events that may be of interest to you, or for other promotional purposes.

 _Use of Outside Vendors_  
The MFA may from time to time retain qualified third-party vendors in order to help us manage the MFA Web Site and allow us to better serve our visitors and customers. These may include third-party vendors we engage to analyze the information we collect on the MFA Web Site for marketing or similar purposes. The MFA requires its vendors to maintain the security of the information to which they are provided access and restricts the vendors from using the information in any way not expressly authorized by MFA. 

We may contract with third parties who use Cookies to collect information on our behalf. These parties are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information. If you would like to opt out of this use of your information, you can change the preferences of your browser so that it does not accept Cookies. We may contract with companies or others to provide certain services, including credit card processing, data management, promotional services, etc. We provide these service providers with the information they need to perform these services, but we restrict the vendors from using the information in any way not expressly authorized by MFA.

 _Transfer of Ownership of Collected Information_  
MFA is the sole owner of the information collected on or through the MFA Web Site. Information collected from you may be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger or bankruptcy involving MFA.  
  
3\. Use of Cookies  
 _Cookies_  
Cookies are small files of information that are stored on your computer's hard drive by your Web browser. The cookies we use do not contain any Personal Information. We place cookies on visitors’ computers to collect aggregate information for site traffic analysis, such as the number of visitors and the number of pages viewed. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change the preferences of your browser so that it does not accept them. In order to use all the features of the MFA Online Store, we recommend that you accept cookies.  
  
4\. Linked Sites  
 _Linking_  
The MFA Web Site may include links to web sites operated by third parties over which we have no control. MFA is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites and encourages you to be aware when you leave the MFA Web Site and to read the privacy policies of each and every web site that collects Personal Information. Once you leave the MFA Web Site, the MFA Privacy Policy will not apply, and you access such sites at your own risk.  
  
5\. Children and Parents  
 _Children Twelve and Under_  
MFA does not solicit Personal Information from children. Visitors twelve years of age and under should remember that they are required to obtain an adult's permission before submitting any Personal Information to this or any other Web site. If your child has submitted Personal Information and you would like to request that such information be removed, you may contact us via one of the contact methods described on the MFA Web Site and we will promptly remove such information and shall not use such information or include it in our database. Users twelve and under and their parents or guardians are advised that any Personal Information voluntarily entered by children may be available for use until MFA becomes aware that a user is under the age of thirteen and has had a reasonable opportunity to remove the information from the MFA Web Site.  
  
6\. Security Measures  
 _Security_  
MFA secure server software uses industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology. SSL encodes your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, as it travels over the Internet so that all transactions are secure. If you prefer, you may also place a MFA Store order by phone at (617) 369-3575 or by fax at (617) 859-9903.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. The MFA shall not be liable for the transfer of any Personal Information resulting from loss or distribution of data, the corruption of storage media, power failures, natural phenomena, riots, acts of vandalism, sabotage, terrorism or any other event beyond the MFA’s reasonable control.
