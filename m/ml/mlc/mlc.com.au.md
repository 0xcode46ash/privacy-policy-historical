# Privacy Policy | MLC Australia

#### What personal information do we collect and hold?

**General information**

The types of information that we collect and hold about you could include:

  * ID information such as your name, postal or email address, telephone numbers, and date of birth;
  * other contact details such as social media handles;
  * financial details such as your tax file number;
  * health information;
  * credit information such as details relating to credit history, credit capacity, and eligibility for credit ('credit worthiness'); and
  * other information we think is necessary.



**What sensitive information do we collect?**

Sometimes we need to collect sensitive information1 about you, for instance in relation to some insurance applications. This could include things like medical checks, medical consultation reports or other information about your health. Unless required by law, we will only collect sensitive information with your consent.

1 Sensitive information is information about a person's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association or trade union, sexual preferences or practices, criminal record, health information, genetic or biometric information.

**When the law authorises or requires us to collect information**

We may collect information about you because we are required or authorised by law to collect it. There are laws that affect financial institutions, including company and tax law, which require us to collect personal information. For example, we require personal information to verify your identity under Commonwealth Anti-Money Laundering law.

**What do we collect via your website activity?**

If you use the internet to access or transact with us or on an account with us (for example internet banking services), we monitor your use of our websites, to ensure we can verify you and you can receive information from us, and to identify ways we can improve our services for you.

If you start but don't submit an on-line application, we can contact you using any of the contact details you've supplied to offer help completing it. The information in applications will be kept temporarily then destroyed if the application is not completed, except where we need to keep it for a business record (for example, insurance applications).

We also know that some customers like to engage with us through social media channels. We may collect information about you when you interact with us through these channels. However for all confidential matters, we'll ensure we interact with you via a secure forum.

To improve our services and products, we sometimes collect de-identified information from web users. That information could include IP addresses or geographical information to ensure your use of our mobile banking applications is secure.

We also collect de-identified information if you use one of our Group calculators or other programs. Although the information collected does not identify an individual, it does provide the Group with useful statistics so that we can analyse and improve our web services. For more information on how we use cookies and tracking tags see our [Cookies Policy](http://www.nab.com.au/cookies).

#### How do we collect your personal information?

**How we collect and hold your information**

We understand that your personal information needs to be looked after and isn't something you leave lying around for just anybody to take. So unless it's unreasonable or impracticable, we will try to collect personal information directly from you (referred to as 'solicited information'). For this reason, it's important that you help us to do this and keep your contact details up-to-date.

There are many ways we seek information from you. We might collect your information when you fill out a form with us, when you've given us a call, used our websites or dropped into one of our branches. We also find using electronic means, such as email or SMS, a convenient way to communicate with you and to verify your details2 .

2 However we'll never ask you for your security details in this way – if you are ever unsure, just contact us

**How we collect your information from other sources**

Sometimes we collect information about you from other sources. We do this only if it's necessary to do so. Instances of when we may need to include where:

  * we can't get hold of you and we rely on publicly available information to update your contact details;
  * we need information from other sources to assess an insurance application you make through us;
  * we are checking the security you are offering through public registers and our service providers; and
  * at your request, we exchange information with your legal or financial advisers or other representatives.



**What if you don** ' **t want to provide us with your personal information?**

If you don't provide your personal information to us, we may not be able to:

  * provide you with the product or service you want;
  * manage or administer your product or service;
  * verify your identity or protect against fraud; or
  * let you know about other products or services from across the Group that might better meet your financial, e-commerce and lifestyle needs.



2 However we'll never ask you for your security details in this way – if you are ever unsure, just contact us

**How we collect and hold your credit information**

We will collect your credit information from details included in your application for credit (whether paper based, phone or electronic). In addition to what we say above about collecting information from other sources, other main sources for collecting credit information are:

  * your co-loan applicants or co-borrowers;
  * your guarantors/proposed guarantors;
  * your employer, accountant, real estate agent or other referees;
  * your agents and other representatives like your referrers, brokers, solicitors, conveyancers and settlement agents;
  * organisations that help us to process credit applications;
  * bodies that issue identification documents to help us check your identity; and
  * our service providers involved in helping us to provide credit or to administer credit products, including our debt collectors and our legal advisers.



**What do we do when we get information we didn't ask for?**

Because we are a big organisation, people often share information with us we haven't sought out (referred to as ' **unsolicited information** '). Where we receive unsolicited personal information about you, we will check whether that information is reasonably necessary for our functions or activities. If it is, we'll handle this information the same way we do with other information we seek from you. If not, we'll ensure we do the right thing and destroy or de-identify it.

**When will we notify you that we have received your information?**

When we receive personal information from you directly, we'll take reasonable steps to notify you how and why we collected your information, who we may disclose it to and outline how you can access it, seek correction of it or make a complaint.

Sometimes we collect your personal information from third parties. You may not be aware that we have done so. If we collect information that can be used to identify you, we will take reasonable steps to notify you of that collection.

**How do we take care of your personal information?**

We store information in different ways, including in paper and electronic form. The security of your personal information is important to us and we take reasonable steps to protect it from misuse, interference and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Some of the ways we do this are:

  * confidentiality requirements of our employees;
  * document storage security policies;
  * security measures for access to our systems;
  * only giving access to personal information to a person who is verified to be able to receive that information;
  * control of access to our buildings; and
  * electronic security systems, such as firewalls and data encryption on our websites.



For more information on our online security and how you can protect yourself online see <http://www.nab.com.au/personal/internet-banking/security>

We can store personal information physically or electronically with third party data storage providers. Where we do this, we use contractual arrangements to ensure those providers take appropriate measures to protect that information and restrict the uses to which they can put that information.

**What happens when we no longer need your information?**

We'll only keep your information for as long as we require it for our purposes. We're also required to keep some of your information for certain periods of time under law, such as the Corporations Act, the Anti-Money Laundering & Counter-Terrorism Financing Act, and the Financial Transaction Reports Act for example. When we no longer require your information, we'll ensure that your information is destroyed or de-identified.

#### How we use your personal information

What are the main reasons we collect, hold and use your information? Because we offer a range of services and products, collecting your personal information allows us to provide you with the products and services you've asked for. This means we can use your information to:

  * provide you with information about products and services;
  * consider your request for products and services, including your eligibility;
  * process your application and provide you with products and services; and
  * administer products and services which includes answering your requests and complaints, varying products and services, taking any required legal action in relation to our accounts and managing our relevant product portfolios.



**Can we use your information for marketing our products and services?**

Given our wide organisation scope, we think we've learnt a lot of things along the way and we'd like to share what we know about our products with you. We may use or disclose your personal information to let you know about products and services from across the Group that might better serve your financial, e-commerce and lifestyle needs, or running competitions or promotions and other opportunities in which you may be interested.

We may conduct these marketing activities via email, telephone, SMS, iM, mail, or any other electronic means. We may also market our products to you through third party channels (such as social networking sites), or based on your use of Group programs. We will always let you know that you can opt out from receiving our third party or Group program marketing offers.

Where we market to prospective customers, we are happy to let them know how we obtained their information and will provide easy to follow opt-outs.

With your consent, we may disclose your personal information to third parties such as brokers or agents, or for the purpose of connecting you with other businesses or customers. You can ask us not to do this at any time. We won't sell your personal information to any organisation outside of the Group.

**Yes, You Can Opt-Out**

You can let us know at any time if you no longer wish to receive direct marketing offers from the Group (see 'Contact Us'). We will process your request as soon as practicable. If you no longer wish to receive MLC Limited marketing/promotional emails click the unsubscribe link included in the footer of our emails.

  * assess whether to accept a guarantor or the risk of a guarantor being unable to meet their obligations; and
  * consider hardship requests.



#### Who do we share your personal information with?

Sometimes, we may need to ask you before this happens. You can view a list of the countries in which those overseas organisations are located at [www.nab.com.au/privacy/overseas-countries-list/](http://www.nab.com.au/privacy/overseas-countries-list/)

We may store your information in a cloud or other types of networked or electronic storage. As electronic or networked storage can be accessed from various countries via an internet connection, it's not always practicable to know in which country your information may be held. If your information is stored in this way, disclosures may occur in countries other than those listed.

Overseas organisations may be required to disclose information we share with them under a foreign law. In those instances, we will not be responsible for that disclosure.

#### How do you access your personal information?

How you can generally access your information

We'll always give you access to your personal information unless there are certain legal reasons why we can't. You can ask us to access your personal information that we hold by filling out the Personal Information Access form (see [www.nab.com.au/privacy/access-form](http://www.nab.com.au/content/dam/nab/about-us/using-this-site/national-australia-bank-privacy-policy/documents/personal-information-request-for-access.pdf)). In some cases we may be able to deal with your request over the phone or in a branch. See 'Contact Us' if you would like a copy of the form to be sent out to you.

We will give you access to your information in the form you want it where it's reasonable and practical (such as a copy of a phone call you may have had with us – we can put it on a disk for you). We may charge you a small fee to cover our costs when giving you access, but we'll always check with you first. You can find the schedule of fees explained on the Access form.

We're not always required to give you access to your personal information. Some of the situations where we don't have to give you access include when:

  * we believe there is a threat to life or public safety;
  * there is an unreasonable impact on other individuals;
  * the request is frivolous;
  * the information wouldn't be ordinarily accessible because of legal proceedings;
  * it would prejudice negotiations with you;
  * it would be unlawful;
  * it would jeopardise taking action against serious misconduct by you;
  * it would be likely to harm the activities of an enforcement body (e.g. the police); or
  * it would harm the confidentiality of our commercial information.



If we can't provide your information in the way you've requested, we will tell you why in writing. If you have concerns, you can complain. See 'Contact Us'.
