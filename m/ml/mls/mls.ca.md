# CREA's Internet Privacy Policy

**_CREA’S INTERNET PRIVACY POLICY_**

It is the policy of The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) that personal information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone number is private and confidential. Because your privacy is important to us, CREA maintains an Internet privacy policy to protect your personal information on its mls.ca website.

**1.** ** _Sites Covered By This Policy_**

MLS.ca is made up of and includes links to many sites including board home pages, REALTOR home pages, advertisers and, in some cases, board listing information sites. This privacy policy applies only to those sites which display the **CREA Privacy Policy** statement. While CREA encourages the site operators to comply with these principles, users should carefully examine the privacy statements of sites appearing on or linking to or from mls.ca which do not display the statement. Personal information that you choose to provide to other sites will be subject to the privacy policies of those sites.

**2.** ** _The Information We Collect_**

**(a) Site Activity Data**

Each time a visitor comes to the mls.ca site, our Web server collects only the visitor’s domain name /IP address but not the e-mail address. While CREA itself does not use "cookies", such use is common in the Internet industry and cookies are used by CREA’s advertising agency. A cookie is a small piece of information that a Web site sends to a visitor’s computer, which is stored on his or her hard drive. 

With the use of cookies, CREA’s advertising agency tracks repeat visits by the same visitor and measures basic usage data such as the number of visits, the average time spent on the site, pages reviewed, etc. This information may be consolidated into group data, which may be shared on an aggregated basis with potential advertisers, research firms and member boards and associations. The shared data will not disclose your identity or personal data and will not enable the recipients to contact you.

**(b) Personal Information**

Personal information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone number is collected only when you voluntarily provide it. Such information is received by CREA only when you send an e-mail through the site or make some other specific contact such as a response to an on-line survey.

The personal information you provide to CREA is forwarded only to the person or department that is equipped to handle your request and is used only to respond to your inquiry. 

**3.** ** _Restriction On Use Of Information_**

The data collected is used to help CREA analyze the browsing patterns of its visitors in order to improve the content and design of mls.ca. 

Personal information will not be sold to any third parties, nor will such information be added to bulk e-mailing lists.

**4.** ** _Policy Revisions_**

Any changes to the CREA Privacy Policy will be promptly communicated on this page. Policy changes will not alter how we handle previously submitted personal information.
