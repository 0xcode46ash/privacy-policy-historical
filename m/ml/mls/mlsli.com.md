### Privacy Policy

### MLSLI.COM TAKES YOUR PRIVACY SERIOUSLY..   


MLSLI.com is committed to your privacy and security and wants to provide you with the best possible online experience. To that end, we want you to understand what kinds of information we gather from you, how this information is used and safeguarded, and how you can control its use.   
This privacy policy covers the following issues:

Finally, as you visit our site, be aware that third parties may at times be able to gather information from you. For example, third party ad servers and companies that place advertisements on our site may use their own cookies and companies offering products or services through the MLSLI.com site may use their own cookies and may collect and use the information you submit. In these cases, the third parties would use your information according to their own privacy policies which may differ from this Privacy Policy. 

**How is my information used?**

The use of your information depends on the context in which it is collected. Therefore, pay special attention to the categories below that relate to the features of our site that you wish to utilize. Also be aware that MLSLI.com may at times be legally compelled to disclose certain information, by means such as subpoenas or court orders. 

**Registration**

Unless you specify that you’d prefer not to hear from us, we may also use the e-mail address you provide at registration to contact you for promotional, administrative, or other reason. You may have these communications terminated at any time. If you indicate that you’re interested in hearing from other companies, we may also share your contact information for that purpose.  


**User Registration Services**

For services provided by the MLSLI.com website, the information you submit is used by us to provide the service you’ve requested. We may also share this information with subcontractors, but only to the extent necessary to fulfill your request. In addition, we may use the contact information and nonfinancial order information you’ve supplied, such as your e-mail address, as set out in the Registration section above. If the service you request requires submission of financial information such as credit card number for an online purchase, rest assured that this financial information is used only for processing your payment, and is not retained after completion of your order unless you have given us the authority to make automatic payments on your credit card. In that event, your credit card information will be retained by us until you cancel your automatic payments. We may, however, store your nonfinancial order information for accounting purposes and to help us to understand your preferences better so that we can offer you future products or services that you may find useful. 

**Purchasing Products And Managing Your Services**

For products and services offered to you jointly by MLSLI.com and a third party, your information may be shared with or independently gathered by the third party. In these situations, MLSLI.com will only use your personal information as it would as if it offered the product or service by itself, but the third party may use the information in different ways. You can tell when a product or service is offered by a third party, because a page of our site will be “co-branded” displaying the third party’s logo and/or name along with our own, or you will be linked to the third party’s site to complete the transaction. Please be aware that each company we do business with has its own policies regarding the use and protection of your information that may differ from those outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you are concerned about how your personal information might be used or protected by a third party, we encourage you to become familiar with that company’s privacy policy before using the service or requesting the product, or to not request the particular product or service. From time to time, we may wish to use personal information you provide when requesting a product or service for purposes beyond those listed above. If this is the case, you will always be notified of the additional use prior to your submitting the personal information, and you’ll be given a chance to “opt out” of that use or to not complete the request, or to not respond to or participate in the survey, contest or other request.

**Automatically Gathered Data**

The information gathered automatically by our system—such as your computer’s IP address, the kind of browser you’re using, and a record of your navigation through our site—may be used by MLSLI.com so we can understand how to make our sites convenient and useful to our audience. In addition, we may share this information, in aggregate form, with our current and potential advertisers so they can know how to present their advertisements more effectively. 

**How is my information protected?**

Since your financial information is especially sensitive, we take special care to keep it secure. We will only transmit or ask for this information over secure Internet connections, using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)encryption, the currently accepted standard for online security, and security keys. In addition, we require password authentication from any third parties you’ve authorized to receive this information. Finally, your credit card number and financial information are never stored on our servers. While this means you may have to enter this information more than once, we believe the added security is worth the extra effort. 

**Scope of This Privacy Policy: Outside Links**

This Privacy Policy only applies to sites owned and operated by MLSLI.com. Our pages contain links to sites outside our control. Please be aware that these sites may collect information about you, and operate according to their own privacy practices that may differ from this Privacy Policy. Remember that once you’re outside our website, any information you submit is outside of our control.
