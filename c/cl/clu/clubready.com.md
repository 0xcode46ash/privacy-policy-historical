**PRIVACY POLICY**

Updated: February 1, 2016

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains what information we collect about you and why, what we do with that information, how we share it, and how we handle the personal information created, inputted, submitted, posted, transmitted, stored or displayed by you, the Subscriber, and your members or customers (which we call “End-Users”) when accessing and using the ClubReady System. Certain terms that are capitalized in this Policy are defined and have the meaning applied in our General Terms of Service. For purposes of this Policy, our “Services” refer to the fitness management software solution made available by ClubReady, LLC, and any services provided by a ClubReady subsidiary or affiliate (collectively, “ClubReady,” “we,” “us” or “our”). We encourage you to periodically review this Policy for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of our Services, the ClubReady System and/or the website, constitutes your agreement to be bound by this Policy, as revised from time to time. Your only remedy, if you do not accept the terms of this Policy, is to discontinue your use of the ClubReady System and Services.

  1. **CHANGES**
    * If there are any changes to this Policy, we will post them on the website and send you an email to the Subscriber address listed on your account. Any changes will be effective as of the date we post them on the website or send the email (whichever is later). You may object to any changes within 20 days after they are posted, in which case none of the proposed changes will be effective with respect to information that we have already collected from you, but will apply only to information we collect in the future. If you object to changes in our Policy, we will have to terminate your account.

**SECURITY POLICY**

Updated: February 1, 2016

This Security Policy should be read in conjunction with ClubReady’s General Terms of Service (“Terms”), the Privacy Policy and all applicable “Addenda.” Collectively, these documents constitute the entire “Agreement” between you and us. This Policy expressly incorporates all terms as defined and used in the General Terms of Service.

At ClubReady, LLC, which includes its subsidiaries and affiliates like CR Payments, LLC and Gym HQ, LLC (collectively, “ClubReady,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), the security of Subscriber Data is a high priority. We maintain the ClubReady System, and all associated data, systems, hardware and software, with technical, administrative, and physical safeguards in place to protect against the loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, and improper disclosure of your Subscriber Data, including End User Data. Despite these safeguards, it’s important that you understanding no computer system or information can even be fully protected against every possible hazard; so long as there are hackers, there are risks. While ClubReady cannot guarantee that its systems or your information will be safe, we are committed to providing reasonable and industry-accepted security controls to protect the ClubReady System and Subscriber Data.

BY ACCESSING, VIEWING OR USING ALL OR ANY PART OF THE CLUBREADY SYSTEM, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THIS POLICY AND THE ENTIERE AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO ACESS OR USE THE CLUBREADY SYSTEM AND YOUR UNAUTHORIZED USE MAY BE DEEMED A VIOLATION OF LAW.

  1. **BEST PRACTICES FOR YOU TO TAKE TO PROTECT CARDHOLDER DATA AND OTHER END USER DATA**
    * We recommend these practices to minimize the risk of a Cardholder Data breach, or a breach of other personal information related to your End Users. Please take steps to do the following: 
      * Maintain updated anti-virus software on all workstations engaged in credit card processing and remove any programs that the anti-virus software flags as potentially malicious.
      * Restrict permission to install software on those computers to your business owner and/or trusted senior staff.
      * Maintain up-to-date versions of operating systems (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Macintosh OS) and web browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari or Firefox), with all security updates and patches installed.
      * Ensure that every individual that logs into the ClubReady System has a unique username and password that is known only by that individual.
      * Only store credit card account numbers in encrypted credit card fields designed for that purpose.
      * Destroy any hard copy documents that have Cardholder Data written on them.
      * Follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”), if you accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover credit cards for payment.
    * Please do not do the following: 
      * Share your account or password;
      * Record Cardholder Data in notes, contact logs, or other unencrypted text fields within the ClubReady System;
      * Record Cardholder Data in any locally installed software program, unless that program and your computer network meet all PCI requirements; or
      * Email End User’s credit card numbers, ask End Users to email credit card numbers to you, or record credit card track data.


  2. **STEPS CLUBREADY IS TAKING TO PROTECT YOUR SUBSCRIBER DATA**
    1. **PCI Compliance.** ClubReady complies with standards set forth by the PCI Security Standards Council to protect Cardholder Data. ClubReady encrypts all stored credit card numbers, we enable restricted firewalls to protect stored data, and we use 128-bit SSL certificates to encrypt data during transfer between the web browser and ClubReady’s database. Approved Scanning Vendor (“ASV”) delivers accurate vulnerability scanning and actionable reporting which enables the ClubReady Network Operations Center to quickly rank risks and gauge compliance against PCI-DSS Standards. Daily Vulnerability Assessments monitor the ClubReady network perimeter against daily threats to help protect you and us from hackers, data breaches, adware, spyware, pop-ups, browser exploits, and phishing attempts.
    2. **Training and Education.** ClubReady makes sure that its employees and staff recognize the importance of personal information protection, and the protection of your Subscriber Data. We have established internal rules and policies related to the access and use of Subscriber Data, and encourage you to do the same with your employees and staff. Our rules and policies are continually assessed, maintained and enforced.
    3. **Personnel Security Measures.** ClubReady’s technical or management personnel with access to Subscriber Data are subject to background checks prior to hiring, and must sign non-disclosure and data security agreements that protect both ClubReady and Subscriber Data.
    4. **Following Laws and Industry Best Practices.** ClubReady complies with all applicable laws, as well as accepted industry best practices, when dealing with your Subscriber Data.


  3. **RISK OF LOSS**
    * ClubReady’s responsibility to protect your Subscriber Data, including Cardholder Data, applies only _after_ such information is encrypted and received by ClubReady’s server(s). You remain responsible for the proper handling and protection of Cardholder Data until such Cardholder Data is encrypted and received by our server(s). Your ability to successfully do this depends on the degree to which you are able to successfully implement the best practices described above and comply with all PCI guidelines.


  4. **CHANGES TO THE SECURITY POLICY**
    * ClubReady reserves the right to change this Security Policy. ClubReady will provide notification of the material changes to this Security Policy through a notification on its website, or via email at least thirty (30) business days prior to the change taking effect.
