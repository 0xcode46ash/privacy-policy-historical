### Cookies and Web Beacons

A cookie is a small data file that sites often store on your hard drive when you visit the Site. Club Monaco may place cookies on your computer to collect information about your visit to the Site and to improve Site functionality. For example, we may place cookies on your computer to understand which pages of the Site you’ve visited, determine which areas and features of our Site are most popular, learn how search engine referral is working effectively, provide unique user identification, preserve the contents of your shopping bag between your visits, and obtain product browsing and purchasing information. 

You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent, but if you turn off cookies or refuse them, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Site’s features, such as making a purchase on the Site or accessing your registered user account information. 

A web beacon, also known as a clear GIF or pixel tag, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our Site or a third-party site where we may advertise, but not on your computer. When you access these pages, web beacons generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies, the web beacon will simply detect an anonymous site visit. We may also use cookies or web beacons to manage and deliver more relevant advertisements on the Site, across the Internet and via email. To learn more about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by our service providers, please [click here](http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/product). Web beacons may also be used to report certain information (but not your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our Site and other sites that advertise and feature links to our Site, so that we can measure the effectiveness of our advertisements. Cookies or web beacons may also be used to let us know if you have opened an email from us. This information allows us to make improvements and updates to enhance your experience.

Further, Club Monaco does not contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give third parties access to such personal information. 

We may share your information with our service providers that provide internal business, professional or technical support functions for Club Monaco.

Club Monaco may share your personal information if such action is required for Club Monaco or any of our service providers to comply with any valid legal process, such as a subpoena, search warrant, statute or court order, or any valid administrative or investigative request from a law-enforcement agency. In addition, we may share your personal information if we or any of our service providers believes that such disclosure is necessary to address any unlawful acts or acts that may endanger the health or safety of another customer or of the general public. 

Club Monaco may also share nonpersonally identifiable or anonymous information about you, such as age, gender, types of products viewed, frequency of Store visits, Site pages you access most frequently or search terms you enter with third parties. For example, Club Monaco may provide a third party with such information as the number of people who shopped at our Site during a specific time period or the number of people who shopped at our Stores and meet certain demographics (e.g., age or gender) during a specific time period. This nonpersonally identifiable or anonymous information does not personally identify a specific visitor to our Site or Stores.

During the normal course of our business, Club Monaco may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties.
