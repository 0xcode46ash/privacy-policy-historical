# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: April 1, 2015

 **Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group Privacy Policy - Your Privacy Rights**

**This Privacy Policy applies to the sites and apps where it appears.**

This Privacy Policy describes how Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group, and independent licensees operating Carlson Rezidor hotels, treat personal information. In this Privacy Policy we refer to all of these entities together as "the Group", "we" or "us". This Privacy Policy applies to the websites and applications where it appears, including the sites and apps for our hotel brands and our loyalty programs. This Privacy Policy sets the standard for data privacy of hotel guests to be observed by all Carlson Rezidor hotels. 

**Various entities control and process your information.**

Depending on how you interact with us, different legal entities will control and process your information. For example, if you make a hotel reservation online, the hotel will be the data controller. If the hotel is located in Europe, the Middle East or Africa (except for Radisson Blu Edwardian hotels), Rezidor Hotels ApS Danmark will be the data processor on behalf of the hotel. In turn, Carlson Hotels, Inc. will be the sub-processor to assist Rezidor Hotels ApS Danmark with the online booking process. If the hotel is located anywhere else in the world, Carlson Hotels, Inc. will be the data processor on behalf of the hotel.

If you join one of our loyalty programs, Carlson Hotels, Inc. will be the data controller and the data processor.

These entities will inform you of their role as soon as practical once you begin your relationship with them. This Privacy Policy describes our collective practices with respect to your personal information. 

**We collect information from and about you.**

**We collect contact information.  **For example, we might collect your name and email address. We may also collect your phone number or mailing address.

**Travel Agent Information.** If you are a travel agent and you enroll in our travel agency loyalty program, we will collect your travel agency ID number. For U.S. travel agents who accrue certain point levels, we may also collect your social security number if required by law to do so. 

**We collect demographic information.**  We may collect information like your gender, age and language preferences.

**We collect guest stay and loyalty program information.**  For example, we collect information on the hotels where you have stayed, your dates of arrival and departure, goods and services purchased, special requests and service preferences. We collect information on your use of our loyalty programs, including how you earn and redeem points.

**We collect payment information.**  For example, we may collect your credit card number if you make a reservation online.

**We collect business information**. For example, we collect contact and other relevant information about your business if your business enrolls in one of our loyalty programs, or if your employees or agents use a corporate account to do business with us. 

 **We collect information you submit or post**. For example, we collect feedback about our hotels and services that you submit to us. We also collect information if you apply for a job.

**We collect other information**. If you use our website, we may collect information about the browser you’re using. We might look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us. If you use our mobile apps, we may collect your GPS location. We might look at how often you use the app and where you downloaded it. We collect this information using the tracking tools described below and in compliance with applicable local law. To control those tools, please read the choices section below.

**We collect information in different ways.**

**We collect information that you give to us**. For example, if you make a reservation online, or enroll in one of our loyalty programs. We also collect information if you contact us or participate in a promotion.

**We collect information about you automatically**. Where permitted by law we use tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons to collect information from you.

We also collect information from our mobile apps.

**We get information about you from third parties.**   Where permitted by law, we may get information from entities within the Group or from other third parties with whom we do business.  We may get information from persons acting on your behalf, for example if someone makes a reservation for you.  We may also get information from social media platforms and advertising and analytics providers.

**We combine information.  **For example, we may combine information that we have collected offline with information we collect online, to the extent covered by the transactional purpose or your consent. Or we may combine information we get from a third party with information we already have.

**We use information as disclosed and described here, subject to your consent obtained depending on where you live.**

**We use information to respond to your requests or questions.** For example, we will use your information to provide the services you request, such as to fulfill a request for a hotel reservation, and to send you a pre-arrival email, a post-departure email, or to ask you to participate in a customer survey. Where legally permitted, we may use your personal data to personalize your experience with us. We might use your information to respond to a question about your loyalty account or to fulfill a redemption request. We use social security numbers and tax ID numbers to process tax documents.

**We use information to improve our websites and services.**  We may use your information to make our hotels, services and loyalty programs better.

Some vendors may be located outside the United States. We may also share information with analytics and search engine providers who act on our behalf.

**We may share information with our business partners where legally permitted.  **  
For example, we might share information with third parties who co-sponsor a promotion. Some of these partners may send you information about product or services by mail or email where legally permitted or based on your prior consent.

**We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves, our customers or others.  **For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. Or when required by law we may share your information if you are the winner of a sweepstakes or other contest with anyone who requests a winner’s list.  We may share information in order to enforce our Site Usage Terms and Conditions or other agreements, and to protect the rights of others. We might share if we are investigating potential fraud. This might include fraud we think has happened during a promotion. 

**We may share information with a successor to all or part of our business**. For example, if part of our business or assets are sold, we may disclose user information as part of that transaction.
