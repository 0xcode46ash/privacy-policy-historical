**Privacy Policy**

We respect your privacy, and we want you to feel comfortable using our website. Therefore, we are providing you with this privacy policy so you can better understand how we collect information about you, what we do with your information, and who, other than CyberClicks, Inc., may also receive your information.

**_Collection of Customer Information_**

In order to provide you with the highest level of service, we ask that you voluntarily provide us with certain information about yourself (collectively, your "Customer Information"). Your Customer Information may include your first and last name, your email address, street address, city and your zip code. We also ask you to voluntarily provide us with the email addresses of your friends on our mailing list page, so they too can benefit from the various products and services offered by CyberClicks, Inc..

**_Use of Customer Information_**

Once we obtain your Customer Information, it is added to a list of other information we have obtained from other CyberClicks, Inc. customers and patrons (the "Customer List").

On occasion, we may hire third parties to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, removing repetitive information from the Customer List, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These third parties have access to your Customer Information to the extent necessary to permit them to do their jobs, however, they may not use it for other purposes.

As CyberClicks, Inc. continues to grow and develop, we might sell assets to, or buy assets from, third parties. In such transactions, Customer Information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that CyberClicks, Inc., or substantially all of CyberClicks, Inc.' assets are acquired, Customer Information will be one of the transferred assets.

We also may disclose your Customer Information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions). 

In addition, we may use the information we obtain from our customers in the aggregate to determine our customers' demographics and preferences. By doing so, we are able to deliver targeted advertisements on our website which you may find to be helpful and informative.

**_Opt-In / Opt-Out_**

You will be provided with an opportunity to receive information from various companies that advertise on our website (collectively, "Third Party Companies" or, individually, a "Third Party Company"). In order to receive or not to receive information from Third Party Companies, you must check or uncheck the box next to the advertiser from whom you wish to receive or not receive additional information from. By checking the box, your Customer information will be sent to that Third Party Company, and you will receive correspondence directly from that Third Party Company. By not or unchecking the box, your Customer information will not be sent to that Third Party Company. CyberClicks, Inc. does not warrant or guaranty the statements, products or services provided by any of the Third Party Companies. Each Third Party Company may have privacy policies that differ significantly from ours, and so you should carefully review the privacy policy of any Third Party Company before providing that company with any additional information about yourself.
