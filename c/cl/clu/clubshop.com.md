# The DHS Club Privacy Policy

We understand that when you are doing business online you need to trust the people with whom you are doing business.  We take this trust very seriously, and make it a priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal information ("PI") you provide us. (PI includes information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address.)
