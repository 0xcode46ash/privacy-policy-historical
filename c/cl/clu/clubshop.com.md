### Privacy Policy

We understand that when you are doing business online you need to trust the people with whom you are doing business. We take this trust very seriously, and make it a priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal information ("PI") you provide us. (PI includes information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address.)

Therefore, as a visitor to The DHS Club's web sites clubshop.com, dhs-club.com, you have the right to understand our information privacy policies before providing the DHS Club with any of your PI.

 **What information we collect**  
The DHS Club collects PI that you voluntarily provide to us as well as certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page at the dhs-club.com and clubshop.com sites. This technical information is collected from your computer's web browser and may include your IP address, operating system, web browser software (i.e. Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), screen resolution and referrer web site.

 **Who we share your information with**  
The DHS Club will only share your contact information with your VIP Membership Coordinators and Team Coaches and with our authorized product and service providers as necessary, in order to complete a transaction that you specifically request. We do not share or sell any of your PI with anyone else - your privacy is completed protected. 

**Other Web sites**  
There are places throughout The DHS Club websites that may link you to other web sites that do not operate under The DHS Club's information privacy practices. When you click through to these web sites, The DHS Club's information privacy practices no longer apply. We recommend that you examine the privacy statements for all third party Web sites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. These third party websites include, but are not limited to ClubShop Mall Stores, Service Providers and Vendors.

 **Our legal obligations**  
The DHS Club may be required by law to disclose information you have provided us. The DHS Club may also disclose information against someone who poses a threat to The DHS Club's interests (such as customer fraud) or whose activities could bring harm to others.

 **How you can control your information**  
The DHS Club provides you with the means of updating or correcting any PI stored in your "My Account" webpage. 

**How we protect your information**  
To ensure the confidentiality of your PI, The DHS Club uses leading security technology and procedures. When you submit personal information on clubshop.com, your data is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology certified by a digital certificate from Thawte Server CA. To view this site certificate on each secured page (a page which begins with "https"), click on the image of the closed lock or the solid key on the bottom bar of your browser window. A small frame displaying site security information will pop up.

By providing you with this Privacy Statement, The DHS Club is pledging our continued commitment to protecting the information you provide us. Your privacy is important to us. Questions regarding this statement should be e-mailed to The DHS Club at [legal@dhs-club.com](mailto:legal@dhs-club.com?Subject=Privacy_Policy_Question) or sent via postal mail to The DHS Club, Inc., 2560 Placida Road, Englewood, FL 34224.
