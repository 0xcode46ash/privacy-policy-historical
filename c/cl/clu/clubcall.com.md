**PRIVACY POLICY**

Thus plc and ClubCall is committed to protecting the privacy of all visitors to the www.clubcall.com website. 

This document outlines our general privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time without specific notice, so please check regularly. 

**What Information does Thus plc and ClubCall collect about me when I visit the site?**  
Thus plc and ClubCall collect very little information about visitors to www.clubcall.com. 

However, every time you view a page on www.clubcall.com, we may store web server logs which show your IP address (the Internet number which your machine uses when it is connected to the Internet), or the IP address of the web proxy you use. In addition we may store other information your web browser passes to us including what you looked at; whether the page request was successful or not; the time at which you accessed the page; and which browser you used to view the pages. 

**What does Thus plc do with this web log information?**  
The use of this data is strictly for statistical purposes only. This helps us understand which areas of the site are of particular interest and also which pages are being requested that no longer exist. It also tells us how many hits and page requests we get. 

**How long do Thus plc keep this web access log information?**  
We process the logs into statistical form on a daily basis. The original logs are destroyed within twelve months of being stored. 

**Who do you share the web access log information with?**  
We very rarely share any of the information collected from your accesses to our site with anyone outside Thus plc. 

It is possible that we may supply aggregate statistical information to third parties for statistical analysis purposes. Such information will be entirely anonymous. 

We would never release non-statistical information about particular IP addresses except in response to a court order or if we are required to do so by law, or if we are investigating a breach of the Acceptable Use Policy and we consider it necessary to disclose your details to a third party. 

**What about cookies?**  
A cookie is a small amount of data which is sent to your browser and stored on your computer from the web server. They are usually used to help remember who you are and what interests you for when you next visit the website.  
When you visit the www.clubcall.com website we store in a cookie, information about your favourite team, your login-id and password (if you have registered with the site). This is then used to automatically route you to your teams page. 

**What if I click on a banner link?**  
From time to time www.clubcall.com hosts links to other web sites using banners. No information about your visit to www.clubcall.com is passed to any site if you click on a banner. 

However, if you click on a banner or indeed follow any other link from www.clubcall.com to another site then that other site will be aware that you have been looking at www.clubcall.com. 

**What happens if I enter a competition or apply for a special offer?**  
From time to time we will run special offers and competitions. To enter these special offers or competitions you will need to provide your name, address, email address, username, password, age, sex and details of your main club. 

We will only use this data for the purposes of the special offer or competition unless stated otherwise, in which case you will be given the choice to opt-out of the use of your data for any other purpose. 

**What if I subscribe to www.clubcall.com?**  
We will ask for the minimal amount of data that is required for us to set up your user account. This will include your name, address, email address and telephone number. We may also ask you other questions. If we do, it will be clearly stated that you need not answer these questions and that failing to answer will not affect your account. 

**Who do you share this personal data with?**  
The personal data we collect when you subscribe to the www.clubcall.com service will be used mainly for subscription purposes. 

However, Thus plc and ClubCall may also use this data for statistical purposes and also for marketing purposes unless you have specifically requested for us not to use it in this way. We may also send you marketing information to your email address. 

We may also share this subscription data in its raw form, or in aggregate to our associates, partners and third parties for statistical or marketing purposes, again, unless you have specifically requested us not to do so (by ticking/unticking the relevant boxes at the point of subscription). These third parties may chose to use this personal data, including your email address, to send you marketing information. 

**What about security of any personal data that I do submit?**  
All data that is collected from the site, be that web site access logs, competition entry information or special offer information is stored in a secure environment which is protected from unauthorised access, improper use, alteration, unlawful or accidental loss or destruction. 

**How long is any personal data kept?**  
Any personal data (name, address, telephone numbers, email addresses, etc.) that we collect for competitions or offer purposes will only be stored for up to 12 months after the end of the competition or the offer and we will destroy all data relating to the competition or offer. 

Any personal data that we collect when you subscribe to the site will be kept whilst you are a registered user. This data will only be stored for up to 12 months after the end of your subscription. 

**What if I have not given consent, how do you know?**  
We maintain databases of the information you submit. If you have opted not to consent to any additional use of your data, then this will be flagged in these databases and we will not contact you for any reason other than those stated at the time you submit your information. 

**How can I correct any information that I have submitted?**
