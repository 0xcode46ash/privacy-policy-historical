### Information Security

We believe that keeping Personal Information secure is one of our most significant responsibilities.

We restrict access to Personal Information about the user to those employees and others who need to know that information to assist us in our business, or to provide products or services to the user. We safeguard personal information, according to the established security standards and procedures, by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to the personal data information.

When we request users or customers to enter sensitive information, such as their name, geographical address, email address, and a credit card number, it is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry SSL and processed through a reputable payment processor. While on the secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon at the bottom of web browsers, e.g. Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer, becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open, when the user is just 'surfing'.

All of our users' and customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are personally granted access to sensitive information.

We do not sell or rent the user's Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes unless they have granted us permission to do so.

We may share the user's Personal Information within other services of Implix for purposes of data processing or storage.

We may also share the user's Personal Information with business partners, service vendors, authorized third-party agents or contractors in order to provide a requested Service or transaction, including processing orders, processing credit card transactions, hosting websites, hosting event and seminar registration and providing customer support. We only provide these third parties with the minimum amount of Personal Information necessary to complete/utilize the requested Service or transaction, and the third parties are not permitted to use the user's Personal Information except for the limited purpose of completing/providing the requested Service or transaction.

We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal processes by disclosing the user's Personal Information and other related information, if necessary. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

We will ask for the user's consent before we use or share their information for any purpose other than the reason they provided or as otherwise provided by this policy. In order for us to know the user's preferences, we will require an action on their part, such as checking the appropriate option, to indicate their consent.
