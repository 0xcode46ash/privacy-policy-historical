This privacy policy is an integral part clicktools.com’s [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/generic.php3?option=terms&playerID=), which you are advised to read. 

clicktools.com Limited respects the confidential nature of the information people and organisations provide in the process of using the site. We set our here how we will use and protect the information you share with us. 

**Personal information**

clicktools.com collects basic personal information (name, address, e-mail address, telephone number) as part of the registration process to uniquely identify and communicate with users of the site. Where assessments call for it, we will ask for additional demographic information. This information is used to provide additional analysis in that assessment. clicktools.com will not divulge this personal information (except where required by legal or regulatory bodies) to anybody without the express permission of the person concerned. Your personal information is stored on secure databases with limited access. We will take action to the fullest extent of the law against attempts to gain unauthorised access to data stored on our or our supplier’s systems. 

We will use the information to maintain our customer database and send you information about additional clicktools.com services if you agreed to that when registering. As part of our efforts to tailor the site to the needs of individual users and to monitor use of the site, we use cookies. You can set your own computer not to use cookies, but this will mean that the service we provide is restricted. 

You can request that your personal information is deleted from our records by sending an e-mail to [service@clicktools.com](mailto:service@clicktools.com). We will delete your personal records but cannot delete information you have supplied in completing an assessment. If you do cancel your registration, you will have to re-register. Cancelling your registration means that you will loose the ability to track and access assessments you have previously completed. 

**Assessment Information**

The information you provide as part of an assessment is confidential. Most assessments do not require information to be tracked or associated with an individual but occasionally bespoke assessments do involve identification of the individual. Whenever this is the case, a message to this effect will be prominently displayed. In all other cases, your responses are stored without your personal details. Where demographic samples are used, it may be possible to identify users based on the demographic information you have supplied. 

Each assessment has an administrator responsible for its management. Administrators decide who will complete the assessment and can check to see who has and has not submitted responses. They cannot access individual assessments except where this has been previously agreed. 

As part of the assessment clicktools.com will collect company confidential information. This information is used to process the assessments and provide feedback and benchmarks. The feedback process does not identify individual companies, unless otherwise expressly stated. Other than fulfilling the purpose and requirements of the assessment (which will always be stated in advance) clicktools.com will not share information that can be identified to an organisation without the express permission of that organisation. 

**Changes to this policy**

Any changes to this policy will be published on this web site at least one week before they come into effect. clicktools.com will notify registered users by e-mail of these changes. You will of course have the option to cancel your registration and have your personal data deleted if you do not agree with the changes.
