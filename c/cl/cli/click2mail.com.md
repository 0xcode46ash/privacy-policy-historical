# Privacy Policy | click2mail.com

Your privacy is very important to us. Click2Mail maintains strict customer information privacy policies and uses state of the art technologies to safeguard customer information and communications from unauthorized intrusions. We do not disclose your customer information to third parties who want to market products to you and we always consider your mailing lists and documents to be your private information and protect them accordingly. 

The following Privacy Statement sets forth the Click2Mail Privacy Policy regarding the protection of our customers' information, and incorporates our US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Statement and our US-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Statement. We are committed to following the principles contained in the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce (the "Principles") regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information which may be collected from our customers residing in a European Union member country or Switzerland and transmitted to the United States. Click2Mail's Safe Harbor certification that it adheres to the Principles can be found at <http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe+harbor+list>. For more information about the Safe Harbor Principles, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Website at <http://export.gov/safeharbor/>. 

This Privacy Policy covers Click2Mail and its corporate affiliates, and applies to all customer information that Click2Mail obtains when a customer registers for or uses a Click2Mail online service, including visiting a Click2Mail owned and controlled web site ("Click2Mail Web Site"). From time to time Click2Mail may offer special promotions, contests or other unique marketing efforts which would be governed by their own specific terms and conditions. Anyone choosing to participate in any such marketing effort consents to the terms and conditions specific to such marketing effort taking precedence over any conflicting terms of service and privacy policies set forth on and applicable to the general use of the Click2Mail Web Site, including the use of customer information by Click2Mail, except that to the extent there is any conflict between such specific terms and the Principles, the Principles shall govern. 

Customer Information 

Online privacy concerns focus on the use and protection of customer information which a customer reasonably expects to be kept private. "Customer information" is information which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, a customer's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, financial information and information about online activities that are directly linked to them. As is common practice, we collect customer information, such as name, address, telephone number, credit card information and a variety of other information in the course of providing products and services to a customer and billing the customer. 

Information collected and stored automatically

During the course of your use of the Click2Mail Web Site and internet services, we automatically track certain information about your visit. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. We use this information in the normal operation of the Click2Mail Web Site and we may disclose or use this information but only on an aggregated basis. We do not use this information to identify you personally without your express consent. See information regarding cookie usage below. 

Click2Mail protects online customer information as follows: 

Collection and Use 

Click2Mail will collect and use your customer information for the purposes for which you submitted it to the Click2Mail Web Site. As part of the process of providing you with our products and services we may transfer your information to certain third party agents, each of which is required to use and safeguard your information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy and the Principles. In addition we use your information for billing purposes, to anticipate and resolve problems with your service, and to create products and services that better meet your needs. This means that Click2Mail may use your customer information, but we will not disclose your customer information to third parties who want to market products to you. Click2Mail may contact you from time to time by means of e-mail, postal mail or by other available means regarding the service for which you are registered. 

Disclosure 

Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Click2Mail will not sell, trade, rent or disclose to third parties any of your customer information derived from your registration for or use of a Click2Mail service -- including customer names and addresses -- without your consent. Click2Mail reserves the right to use or share your information to respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities or where required by law. When Click2Mail uses other agents, contractors or companies to perform services on its behalf, Click2Mail will ensure that such agents, contractors or companies protect your customer information consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may also provide your information to a third party in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of Click2Mail to which the information relates, in which case we will require any such buyer to agree to treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Click2Mail's physical facilities are very secure. Access to our data center is limited by electronic badge entry and only selected employees are granted access. Our data center and all production facilities are also secured and monitored with surveillance cameras. Access to production areas is restricted to selected employees with security badges. 

Improper Conduct 

Click2Mail may also use customer information to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity or activity that threatens the network or otherwise violates our Terms of Service. 

Third Party Collectors of Information 

Our policy addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information on other third party sites, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information. In the case of dealers and resellers of Click2Mail services or Click2Mail co-branded services, we exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cause such persons to honor the provisions of this privacy policy, but we cannot be held responsible if they fail to do so. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all third parties to which you disclose your personal information.
