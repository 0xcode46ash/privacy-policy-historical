# Privacy Policy | click2mail.com

Your privacy is very important to us. Click2Mail maintains strict customer information privacy policies and uses state of the art technologies to safeguard customer information and communications from unauthorized intrusions. Click2Mail has put in place the following Privacy Policy to protect customer information. Except as specifically modified in a Customer Agreement, this policy covers Click2Mail and its corporate affiliates, and applies to all customer information that Click2Mail obtains when a customer registers for or uses a Click2Mail online service, including visiting a Click2Mail owned and controlled web site ("Click2Mail Web Site"). 

Customer Information 

Online privacy concerns focus on the protection of "customer information" which a customer reasonably expects to be kept private. "Customer information" is information which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, a customer's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and information about online activities that are directly linked to them. As is common practice, we collect customer information, such as name, address, telephone number, and a variety of other information in the course of billing and providing marketing and mailing services to a customer. 

Information collected and stored automatically

In the course of using our Web site and Internet services, we also automatically track certain information about your visit. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. We use this information in the normal operation of the site and we may disclose this information only on an aggregated basis. We do not use this information to identify you personally without your express consent. See information regarding cookie usage below. 

Click2Mail protects online customer information as follows: 

Collection and Use 

Click2Mail will collect and use customer information for billing purposes, to anticipate and resolve problems with your service, or to create products and services that better meet your needs. This means that Click2Mail may use your customer information, but we will not disclose your customer information to third parties who want to market products to you. Click2Mail may contact you from time to time by means of e-mail, postal mail or by other available means regarding the service you are registered for. 

Disclosure 

Except as provided in this policy, Click2Mail will not sell, trade, rent or disclose to third parties any customer information derived from the registration for or use of a Click2Mail online service -- including customer names and addresses -- without the consent of the customer except as required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process or in the case of imminent physical harm to the customer or others. When Click2Mail uses other agents, contractors or companies to perform services on its behalf, Click2Mail will ensure that such agents, contractors or companies protect your customer information consistent with this Policy. 

Access 

You may review any of your personal information we have collected from you by contacting us at the address below. Click2Mail will correct or delete any inaccurate information upon your request. 

Security 

Click2Mail has implemented technology and security features and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy of your customer information from unauthorized access or improper use, and we will continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes available. 

E-mail and Postal Mail Contents 

Click2Mail will not read or disclose to third parties private postal or electronic communications that are transmitted using Click2Mail services except as required to operate the service or as otherwise authorized by law. 

We consider your mailing lists and documents to be your private information. All document and list files you submit will be used solely for the production of your mailings. Electronic information submitted by you is securely stored only for the time specified in our Terms of Service after such time data is purged from our system. 

Data Center and Production Center Security 

Click2Mail's physical facilities are very secure. Access to our data center is limited by electronic badge entry and only selected employees are granted access. Our data center and all production facilities are also secured and monitored with surveillance cameras. Access to production areas is restricted to selected employees with security badges. When Click2Mail uses other contractors or companies to perform services on its behalf, we will ensure that such agents, contractors or companies protect your information consistent with this Policy. 

Improper Conduct 

Click2Mail may also use customer information to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity or activity that threatens the network or otherwise violates the customer agreement for that service. 

Third Party Collectors of Information 

Our policy addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information on other third party sites, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information. In the case of dealers and resellers of Click2Mail services or Click2Mail co-branded services, we exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cause such persons to honor the provisions of this privacy policy, but we cannot be held responsible if they fail to do so. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all third parties to which you disclose your personal information..
