# ClickCash - Privacy Policy

**PRIVACY POLICY**

**Effective: March 2009**

ClickCash.com respects and safeguards the privacy of every individual who visits our website. This Privacy Statement is a formal document that outlines the information which may be collected about you while you use ClickCash.com, and how that information may be used. This Statement will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your personal information collected or shared when you visit ClickCash.com. 

**Personally-Identifiable Information**

ClickCash.com collects Personally-identifiable information about you (including, but not limited to, your name, your business name, address, telephone number, email address, Social Security number, business identification number or any combination of data that could be used to identify you, such as birth date and zip code) when you provide it to us voluntarily or authorize our access to it. 

When you provide us with Personally-identifiable information or authorize our access to it, such information will be gathered solely by WebPower, Inc. for use by WebPower, Inc. In addition, parties who provide support services on our behalf, such as banking services, electronic payment services, e-mail delivery services, and other professional services may have limited access to your Personally-identifiable information in order to provide their services. These service providers do not use this information for other purposes beyond providing the service. We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your Personally-identifiable information with any third parties for their promotional purposes. 

At any point on our website where Personally-identifiable information is requested, any information that is optional to provide, rather than mandatory, will be clearly marked as such. We may use Personally-identifiable information in the following ways: we may store and process that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services; we may use that information to contact you about billing issues, technical issues, or as a follow-up to your request to receive more information about our products and services; and we may use that information to ensure the protection of our rights. Financial information that is collected is used to check your qualifications for registration and to ensure proper payment for products and services. The information that you authorize WebPower, Inc. to collect or access is used to verify your age and identity, as well as to provide you with support services while you are using ClickCash.com (a third party service may be used to validate your age and identification information). If you provide us with your Personally-identifiable information in reference to a domain name that you become aware of on or through our services, we will share such Personally-identifiable information with the domain name seller in order to provide the domain name seller with information to contact you directly and independently; we will not otherwise share such information with third parties. 

Your use of ClickCash.com may also include the transfer of your Personally-identifiable information, individual information, personal data and/or sensitive information outside of your country, including without limitation from the European Union to the United States. At all times, you have the right and ability to withhold the transfer of your Personally-identifiable information, individual information, personal data and/or sensitive information by not establishing an account with this service. You agree that the transfer of such information is necessary to establish a ClickCash.com Associate relationship with WebPower, Inc., and by establishing an account with ClickCash.com you provide express voluntary consent for your Personally-identifiable information, individual information, personal data and/or sensitive information to be transferred and processed outside of your country, including without limitation from the European Union to the United States. 

If you have already submitted Personally-identifiable information to us and would like for us to remove it from our records, please contact us at the e-mail address listed at the bottom of this Statement. We will use reasonable efforts to remove your information from our existing files. 

You may receive email communications related to the support services that ClickCash.com provides to you. You may opt-out from such email communications at any time by contacting [support @ clickcash](mailto:support@clickcash.com) and discontinuing your use of the ClickCash.com services. 

If your Personally-identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or deactivate your information. Simply update or deactivate your information by emailing us at [acctupdate @ clickcash](mailto:acctupdate@clickcash.com) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. 

We will not disclose your Personally-identifiable information unless it is necessary to do so to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process (including without limitation search warrants, court orders or providing assistance to law-enforcement authorities), or, if the disclosure to a financial institution assists us in processing payments or in proving the legitimacy of a charge. 

**Non-Personally-Identifiable Information Collected Automatically**

In some cases, information that is not personally-identifiable may be automatically collected about you either through server log files or cookies (examples of this type of information include without limitation your IP address, the type of internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the website from which you linked to our site). For registered users of WebPower, Inc.'s web properties, we link this information to your account information; however, for non-registered users, we never link this information to any Personally-identifiable information. 

**Information That May Be Placed Automatically On Your Computer's Hard Drive**

When you view our websites, we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file and will help us in many ways. For example, cookies allow us to tailor web pages to better match your interests and preferences, and maintain your login session. For registered users of our web properties, we link this information to your account information; however, for non-registered users, we never link this information to any Personally-identifiable information. With most internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. To learn how to prevent ClickCash.com from using cookies during your visit to ClickCash.com and/or our other web properties, and how to erase cookies from your hard drive, see our [Guide to Managing Cookies](http://www.clickcash.com/ifpage.dll?t=ALT/clickcash/general/ManageCookies). 

**Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

If you have any questions about security on our website, you can send an email to us at [security @ clickcash](mailto:security@clickcash.com). 

**Changes to Privacy Policy**

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
