Examples of further instances in which we may collect your personal information include:

  * **Purchases.** When you make a purchase online we will collect order information in order to facilitate delivery and payment for the product and/or services. Your credit card information will only be collected and stored by our third party payment gateway service provider who is fully PCI compliant, and not by Clickatell. Our third party payment gateway services provider may collect IP address, browser version and other information about the software and hardware resident on the computer you use to make the purchase. This information is collected and used solely for purposes of authentication and security. By making a purchase on our website you authorize such collection and use.
  * **Contacting us.** You are also able to send emails or requests through the website. Your messages will contain your screen name and email address, as well as any additional information you may wish to include in the message. Because we use the website as a tool to provide customer service and product support, a visit to the website may also result in your personal information being sent to an individual within Clickatell.



**Sensitive personal information.** Clickatell’s intention is not to seek any sensitive information through our website unless legally required for recruiting purposes. Sensitive information includes a number of types of information relating to: race or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or other similar beliefs; trade union membership; physical or mental health; sexual life or criminal record. We suggest that you do not provide sensitive information of this nature. If you do wish to provide sensitive information for any reason, you explicitly consent to our use of that information in the ways described in this privacy statement or as described at the point where you choose to disclose this information.

**Unnecessary collection.** It is Clickatell’s policy to limit the information collected to only the minimum information required to complete a visitor’s request. In any instance where non-mandatory information is sought, the website visitor will be notified of this at the point of collection. Clickatell makes every practical effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of information. If you believe that our website has collected excessive information, we encourage you to contact our Privacy Officer at [legal@clickatell.com](mailto:legal@clickatell.com) to raise any concerns.

**Use of information.** Personal information attained by our website is used only for the intended purpose stated at the time that the information is collected. This information is not shared with other companies in the group for secondary or unrelated purposes, or shared with a third party, unless otherwise disclosed at the point of collection or in this policy. If there is an instance where such information may be shared for other purposes, you will be asked for permission beforehand.

**Marketing.** Except for the mailing list initiative described above, where you explicitly choose to receive specific Clickatell marketing or other materials, Clickatell will not use personal information collected from our websites to facilitate unsolicited marketing activities. You may at any time log into your Clickatell account to enable or disable the marketing newsletter or weekly account balance update newsletter feature in your account preferences. You may also select to unsubscribe from any email newsletter or SMS notification by following the unsubscribe and opt-out directions in the body of such email or SMS.

**Cookies.** Cookies may be used on some pages of our site. “Cookies” are small text files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing a more customised website experience. For example, a cookie can be used to store registration information in an area of our website site so that you do not need to re-enter it on subsequent visits to that area. It is Clickatell’s policy to use cookies to make navigation of our websites easier for visitors and to facilitate efficient registration procedures. Website statistics are compiled by Clickatell and used for statistical reporting only. If you are concerned about cookies, most browsers permit individuals to decline cookies. In most cases, you may refuse a cookie and still fully navigate our websites; however other functionality in our website may be impaired. After termination of your visit to our website, you can always delete the cookie from your system if you wish.

**Log files.** In order to properly manage our website we may anonymously log information on our operational systems, and identify categories of visitors by items such as domains and browser types. These statistics are reported in the aggregate to our webmasters. This is to ensure that our website presents the best web experience for visitors and is an effective information resource.

**Display advertising.** We use third-party advertising technology to serve ads when you visit our website and sites upon which we advertise. This technology uses information about your visits to our website and the sites upon which we advertise, to serve our ads to you. In the course of serving our advertisements to you, unique third-party cookies may be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we may use web beacons, provided by our third-party ad server, to help manage and optimize our online advertising. These web beacons enable our ad server, on our behalf or on behalf of our agent, to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits this site, and to learn which banner ads bring users to our website. Our third-party ad server is performing its functions on our behalf or on behalf of our agent, and we may, directly or indirectly, instruct such ad server to enable other service providers to receive information about our site related to our online advertising. 

**Email advertising.** We share web site usage information about visitors to our web site, who have consented to and received a targeted promotional campaign, with a reputable third-party advertising company for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and our third-party advertising company note some of the pages you visit on our web site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). 

**Third party links.** There are several places throughout our website that may link to other websites that do not operate under our privacy practices. When you link to other websites, Clickatell’s privacy practices no longer apply. We encourage you to review each non-Clickatell website’s privacy policy before disclosing any personally identifiable information.

**Information retention.** Some of the information we receive is not retained. Contact information about visitors to our website (such as information generated though registration for access to areas on the site) will be kept as long as the information is required to completely service the contact request or until a user requests that we delete that information. Mailing list information, discussion posts and email are kept for only the period of time considered reasonable to facilitate the visitor’s requests. Resumes are disposed of when they are either no longer under consideration, or are considered dated by our Human Resources departments.

**Choices.** As a policy, visitors are not required to register to gain access to areas of the Clickatell’s websites. In certain cases in the future, as your Clickatell website experience expands, we may require visitors to register in order to obtain a user-id and password for authentication and secure access to a transaction or certain business confidential or proprietary information services on premium websites.

**Unsubscribe.** You voluntarily provide us with personal information. Should you subsequently choose to unsubscribe from mailing lists or any registrations, we will provide instructions on the appropriate website area or in communications to you; or you may contact Clickatell Support at [support@clickatell.com](mailto:support@clickatell.com).
