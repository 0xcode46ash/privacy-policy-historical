1\. GENERAL

**Introduction:** Clickatell is committed to business practices in compliance with industry acceptable privacy standards and in compliance with the law. This policy sets out what the categories of personal information we may collect from you or other sources when you make use of our website and how we process that personal information.

We may amend this policy from time to time, in line with changes required by legislation or our internal business requirements. The most updated version will apply and you therefore need to review the [Privacy Policy](https://www.clickatell.com/terms/2015/07/16/privacy-policy/) each time you visit the website. Unless we expressly state otherwise, the amended version of the Privacy Policy shall supersede and replace all previous versionsprivacy thereof.

If you have any questions about this policy or do not agree with it, please contact us directly at [legal@clickatell.com](mailto:legal@clickatell.com) for attention: Clickatell Privacy Officer.

By using our website, you consent to the terms of this [Privacy Policy](https://www.clickatell.com/terms/2015/07/16/privacy-policy/).

**Personal information:** Personal Information will include information defined by the applicable legislation to be “personal information”. This is information which you provide to us which personally identifies you or another person, such as name, email address, ID number or company registration number, billing information, or other data which we can reasonably link to such personal information.

**Collection and use of personal information:** We collect personal information about you when you provide information through the website or our systems. We may also collect information about you from other third parties related to our operations or within our business structure. The information we collect is limited to the details we need to provide the specific service that you have requested. We will only collect personal information for a specified purpose and collect and process personal information only for the purpose for which you give it to us. We do not collect or compile personal information for dissemination or sale to outside parties for consumer marketing purposes, or host mailings on behalf of third parties. It is Clickatell’s policy to limit the information collected to collect only the minimum information required considering the purpose for which the information was collected. In any instance where non-mandatory information is sought, you will be notified of this at the point of collection. Clickatell makes every practical effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of information. If you believe that our website has collected excessive information, we encourage you to contact our Privacy Officer at [legal@clickatell.com](mailto:legal@clickatell.com) to raise any concerns. Unless the law requires otherwise, we only use the personal information you provide to us to deliver the specific information or service you have requested. Without your express consent, we will not use your contact details for any other purpose, except to

  * perform our duties in terms of our agreement with you;
  * carry out, monitor and analyse our business;
  * contact you by email, SMS, letter, telephone or in any other way about our products and services if you request us to do so, unless you tell us that you prefer not to receive communications;
  * develop or improve products or services that may be of interest to you;
  * carry out market research, business and statistical analysis;
  * carry out audits;
  * perform other administrative and operational purposes including the testing of systems;
  * comply with our regulatory or other obligations;
  * carry out any other reasonable business operation considering our business and the relationship between you and us.



We will keep your personal information confidential and only share it with others for the purposes set out in this policy, or otherwise if you have consented thereto, or if we are legally obliged or entitled to do so. We have trusted relationships with carefully selected third parties who perform services on our behalf.

We may share information about you with (i) any payment system we may use; (ii) other divisions or companies within the group of companies; (iii) other companies that provide products or services to us; (iv) regulatory and governmental authorities, ombudsmen, or other authorities, including tax authorities, where we are requested by them to do so; (v) any other third party if allowed to do so in law.

When we employ another company to perform a function on our behalf, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. To the extent that that third party requires your information to enable Clickatell to provide you with our services, or perform business-related functions on our behalf, you hereby consent to Clickatell sharing your personal information with such third parties.

**Sensitive personal information and children’s information:** Clickatell’s intention is not to seek any sensitive information through our website unless legally required or for recruiting purposes. Sensitive information includes information relating to (i) race or ethnic origin; (ii) political opinions; religious or other similar beliefs; (iii) trade union membership; (iv) physical or mental health; sexual life or criminal records. We request that you do not provide sensitive information of this nature. If you do wish to provide sensitive information for any reason, you explicitly consent to our use of that information in the ways described in this privacy statement or as described at the point where you choose to disclose this information. 

We understand the importance of protecting children’s privacy especially in an online environment. Our website is not intentionally designed for or directed at children. It is Clickatell’s policy never to knowingly collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 18.

**Trans-border transmission:** Personal information collected or processed by Clickatell may be shared between companies within the Clickatell Group or be processed by third party service providers where it is necessary to meet the purpose for which you have submitted the information. For these purposes personal information may be processed cross-border and by submitting personal information on Clickatell’s website or to our systems, you explicitly consent to trans-border transmission of the information.

**Consent:** We only collect or process personally identifiable information if it is specifically and voluntarily provided by you or as otherwise disclosed in this [Privacy Policy](https://www.clickatell.com/terms/2015/07/16/privacy-policy/). **If you provide us with personal information about another person, you warrant that you have that person’s consent to do so and that that person has given explicit consent for Clickatell to collect or process their personal information for the purpose for which you submitted it to us..**

**Retention:** Some of the information we receive is not retained. Generally information will be retained in terms of our internal retention policies. By way of example, contact information about visitors to our website (such as information generated though registration for access to areas on the site) will be retained as long as the information is required to completely service the contact request or until a user requests that we delete that information. Mailing list information, discussion posts and email are kept for the period of time considered reasonable to facilitate the visitor’s requests. Resumes are disposed of when they are either no longer under consideration, or are considered outdated by our Human Resources departments.

**Security:** We have implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect personal information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. We make use of electronic and computer safeguards such as firewalls. We have physical and electronic access control to our buildings.

All Clickatell employees follow a network-wide security policy in terms whereof we only authorise access. Only authorised Clickatell personnel are provided access to personal information and these employees have agreed contractually to ensure confidentiality of this information. Clickatell’s policy is to use secure socket layer technology for our customer’s administration area in order to protect information submitted through web forms.

We are committed to ensure your personal information is kept secure and confidential and not kept for longer than is necessary for the purpose for which we collected it.

**Right to request access and changes to personal information:** If any of your personal information changes, you must let us know immediately by updating your Clickatell account or contacting our Support team at [support@clickatell.com](mailto:support@clickatell.com).

Subject to applicable law, you have the right of access to personal information you have submitted to Clickatell. Clickatell is committed to providing reasonable and practical access to visitors to allow them the opportunity to identify and correct any inaccuracies. When requested and practical, Clickatell will delete identifying information from current operational systems. If you want us to remove or update any of your personal information, please contact our Support team at [support@clickatell.com](mailto:support@clickatell.com). 

Clickatell does not assume responsibility for verifying the ongoing accuracy of personal information. When practically possible, if we are informed that any personal information submitted to our website or systems and stored by us is no longer accurate, Clickatell will make appropriate changes. However, Clickatell will not be liable for any damage that you may suffer from any cause what so ever due to inaccurate information being provided to Clickatell or a failure to update information.

In most cases, you may refuse a cookie and still fully navigate our websites; however other functionality in our website may be impaired. After termination of your visit to our website, you can always delete the cookie from your system if you wish. 

**Log files:** In order to properly manage our website we may anonymously log information on our operational systems, and identify categories of visitors by items such as domains and browser types.
