At Clickatell we respect and take steps to protect your privacy. We strive to make our site a safe environment for everyone who visits and uses Clickatell services. We are committed to providing you the best possible online service and experience as well as the best products and services. The purpose of this policy statement is to fully share with you:

  * How we use the information
  * With whom we share the information
  * How you can change the information



This policy addresses our practices with respect to our website, but does not address the practices of any website we link to (including the merchants and content providers we link to). This policy is incorporated into, and subject to the terms of, our User Agreement.

How We Use Information collected

We use information which you provide us to keep track of the Clickatell services you have signed up to receive. We may also use personally identifiable information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyse site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customise our site's content and layout. We do this in an attempt to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our users' needs. We may also use personally identifiable information about you to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners and promotions. We use your email address to contact you regarding administrative notices or latest news from time to time. 

We use personally identifiable information that you have provided to us, including your email address and mobile number, to contact you via SMS or email with administrative notices, news or promotions from time to time. 

On the other hand, upon account registration, you are by default, opted-out of receiving a weekly account balance update newsletter and you will not receive this communication until you select to opt-in on the registration form. You may also opt-in or unsubscribe from receiving this weekly Balance Update newsletter at any time by logging into your account and enabling or disabling this newsletter feature in your account preferences. 

On the other hand, upon registration, you are by default, opted-in to receiving occasional promotional emails and SMS', usually once every week or two. You will continue to receive these promotional communications for as long as your are an active customer of Clickatell, until you select to unsubscribe from them by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the promotional emails or by replying "STOP" to the SMS'.

We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the site, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms and Conditions.

This is with particular reference to any database, numbers and/or recipient details that you may deliver to us, or store on our databases.

Disclosure of Your Information

We do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. We do aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in aggregate to advertisers and for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you. Clickatell offers features on our site where we will by necessity, need to provide some of your information to the third party offering such services. To the extent that that third party requires your information to enable you to use their service, we will notify you of the specific information that will be provided to such third parties. Before you use the service you should evaluate whether you will accept the terms and conditions of the third party service, and give Clickatell the right to pass your information on to that third party. In addition, we must comply with court orders, information requests from government agencies and regulators and other legal and regulatory processes that may require the disclosure of your personally-identifiable information.

For those users who make purchases at our website, we, through our third-party payment processor, may collect IP address, browser version and other information about the software and hardware resident on the computer used to make the purchase. This information is passed on to and used by our third-party payment processor solely for purposes of authentication and security. By making a purchase at our website you authorize such collection and use. 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We use SSL encryption technology to protect the transfer of your information.
