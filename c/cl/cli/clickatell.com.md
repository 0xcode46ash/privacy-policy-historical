# Privacy Policy | Clickatell

Updated: 16 August 2012

The data controller collecting the data described herein is the [**Clickatell Group***](http://www.clickatell.com/about-us/privacy-policy/#footnote1) (hereinafter referred to as “Clickatell”). Personal data collected by Clickatell may be transferred between entities, where it is necessary to meet the purpose for which the visitor has submitted the information. **By submitting data on Clickatell’s website, the visitor is providing explicit consent to transborder transmission of data collected on the website for the fulfilment of their voluntary requests.**

**Data collection**

We collect only personally identifiable information that is specifically and voluntarily provided by visitors to Clickatell’s website. Clickatell receives limited identifiable information, such as name, title, company address, email address, and telephone and fax numbers, from website visitors. Typically, identifying information is collected to:

  * Register for certain services
  * Improve our marketing and promotional efforts, by enabling statistical analysis of site and product usage
  * Deliver information to you, such as administrative notices and news
  * Deliver account balance updates
  * Answer your requests and queries
  * Submit resumes



Demographic information, including gender and occupation, is not actively sought, but may be submitted when a visitor responds to an online job application. It is Clickatell’s policy to limit the information collected to only the minimum information required to complete a visitor’s request. In any instance where non-mandatory information is sought, the website visitor will be notified of this at the point of collection.

Most publications are provided as downloads and visitors will be requested to provide us with some personal information before downloading such publications.

When a visitor makes a purchase online we will collect order information and a customer’s credit card information, where applicable, in order to facilitate delivery and payment for the product and/or services. Visitor’s credit card information will only be collected and stored by our third party payment gateway service provider who is fully PCI compliant, and not by Clickatell.

Visitors are also able to send email and/or requests through the site. Their messages will contain the user’s screen name and email address, as well as any additional information the user may wish to include in the message. Because we use the website as a tool to provide customer service and product support, a visit to the website may also result in the user sending personal information to an individual within Clickatell.

Clickatell’s intention is not to seek any sensitive information through our website unless legally required for recruiting purposes. Sensitive information includes a number of types of data relating to: race or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or other similar beliefs; trade union membership; physical or mental health; sexual life or criminal record. We suggest that you do not provide sensitive information of this nature. **If you do wish to provide sensitive information for any reason, Clickatell accepts your explicit consent to use that information in the ways described in this privacy statement or as described at the point where you choose to disclose this information.**

**Use of data**

A user may choose to provide personal information in the following examples:

  * Download publications
  * Register for Clickatell’s online products and/or services
  * Submit resumes or work history information
  * Participate in “join our mailing list” initiatives
  * Participate in bulletin boards, discussion or message forums
  * Contact us for further information
  * Enter Quick Surveys, Quiz’s or Benchmarking Surveys
  * Register for events and conferences



Information attained by the site is used only for the intended purpose stated at the time that the information is collected. This data is not shared with other entities in the group for secondary or unrelated purposes, or shared with a third party, unless otherwise disclosed at the point of collection or in this policy. If there is an instance where such information may be shared, the visitor will be asked for permission beforehand.

Clickatell makes every practical effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of data. If a visitor believes the site has collected excessive information, we encourage the visitor to contact our Privacy Officer at [legal@clickatell.com](mailto:legal@clickatell.com) to raise any concerns.

Except for the mailing list initiative described above, where visitors explicitly choose to receive specific Clickatell marketing or other materials, Clickatell will not use personal data collected from our websites to facilitate unsolicited marketing activities.

Clickatell customers may at any time log into their customer account to enable or disable the marketing newsletter or weekly account balance update newsletter feature in your account preferences. You may also select to unsubscribe from any email newsletter or SMS notification by following the unsubscribe and opt-out directions in the body of such email or SMS.

**Cookies and log files**

Cookies may be used on some pages of our site. “Cookies” are small text files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing a more customised website experience.

Site statistics are compiled by Clickatell and used for statistical reporting only.

After termination of the visit to our site, you can always delete the cookie from your system if you wish.

In order to properly manage our website we may anonymously log information on our operational systems, and identify categories of visitors by items such as domains and browser types. These statistics are reported in the aggregate to our webmasters. This is to ensure that our website presents the best web experience for visitors and is an effective information resource.

Mailing list information, discussion posts and email are kept for only the period of time considered reasonable to facilitate the visitor’s requests. Resumes are disposed of when they are either no longer under consideration, or are considered dated by our Human Resources departments.

**Choices**

As a policy, visitors are not required to register to gain access to areas of the Clickatell’s websites. In certain cases in the future, as your Clickatell website experience expands, we may require visitors to register in order to obtain a user-id and password for authentication and secure access to a transaction or certain business confidential or proprietary information services on premium websites.

Personally identifiable information provided to Clickatell through its website is provided voluntarily by visitors. Should visitors subsequently choose to unsubscribe from mailing lists or any registrations, we will provide instructions on the appropriate website area or in communications to our visitors; or a visitor may contact Clickatell Support at [support@clickatell.com](mailto:support@clickatell.com).

When personally identifiable information is retained, Clickatell assumes responsibility for keeping an accurate record of the information once a visitor has submitted and verified the data.
