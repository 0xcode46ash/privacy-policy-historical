Marketing Communications

With your consent, the information you provide may be used by Clinique Canada Online to create and deliver to you emails such as our newsletters, surveys or other email messages containing product and event information, cosmetics tips or promotions or to phone you. If you do consent to receive these communications and later decide that you would no longer like to receive them, see the "Your Choices" Section below. You may receive the benefit of hearing from Clinique Canada Online via direct mail even if you have not elected to receive other marketing communications. If you do not wish to receive direct mail, see "Your Choices"  Section below.  


Communications to Serve You

If you have elected to provide us with your contact information, we may provide you with service related announcements by any means, including email, concerning the Site or contact you regarding your customer service requests or questions or your order. For example, all registered users will receive a welcoming email to confirm their registration. When you email our customer service department with a comment or question, we collect the personally identifiable information you provide us, such as your name, email address, contact information and any information relating to your comment or question, and may forward such information, along with your inquiry, to our affiliates in the United States in order to investigate and respond to your inquiry. These types of communications are necessary to serve you, respond to your concerns and to provide the high level of customer service that Clinique Canada Online offers its customers. 

Customized Service

We may also offer features on our Site that invite you to provide information about your skin type and skincare concerns or preferences. We may use your personal information to provide you with customized service and use of our Site. For example, we may suggest products that would be of particular interest to you.   


Special Events, Questionnaires and Surveys

On occasion, Clinique Canada Online may sponsor special events (such as contests, sweepstakes or other offerings), questionnaires and surveys. When you enter a contest or participate in a promotion, we may collect your name, address, phone number and email address. We use this information to administer your participation in the contest or promotion. There may be specific rules applicable to these promotions that explain how any personal information you provide will be processed. We strongly suggest you review any applicable rules before participating. To the extent any special event, questionnaire or survey is not subject to specific rules, the processing of personal information is governed by this Privacy Policy and the purposes it sets forth.  


Employment

If you provide personal information, such as a resume, to us with respect to employment opportunities with Clinique Canada we will treat such personal information as confidential and use it only to consider you for current and future employment opportunities and to contact you with respect to employment with us or our affiliates. An " ** _Affiliate_** " is a person or entity that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with, our company. We will retain your recruiting information for further recruitment opportunities that may arise, unless you tell us that you no longer wish for us to retain your information. Clinique Canada is an Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action employer. We affirm the right of every person to participate in all aspects of employment without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, creed, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, or status with regard to public assistance, or other protected classifications.

Clinique Canada has no control over or responsibility over the recruitment and/or hiring process of any third party retailers and department stores; the ability of such retailers or department stores to offer job opportunities to candidates; or the quality of candidates to fill job openings, and Clinique Canada makes no representations or warranties about any and all such employment opportunities or about any information processing practices or security measures of such third party retailers or department stores. Questions regarding their practices, measures or policies should be made directly to them.
