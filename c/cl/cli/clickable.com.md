If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact Clickable's privacy administrator by sending email to privacy@Clickable.com. Please allow three business days for a reply. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in Clickable's Master Services Agreement (the "Services Agreement"). 

####  Clickable Privacy Statement:

Clickable recognizes that privacy is important. Clickable provides this privacy statement ("Statement") to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of Clickable owned or operated websites (the "Site") and the Clickable Service (as defined in the Service Agreement). Because we gather important information from our visitors and Customers, we have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. By using the Site, you are consenting to our use and processing of your information as set forth in this Statement. We reserve the right to change this Statement and will provide notification of a change at least thirty (30) business days prior to the change taking effect. This Statement does not apply to the practices of companies that Clickable does not own or control or to people it does not employ or manage. Customers who wish to use Clickable's Service will be prompted to create User Accounts as defined in the Services Agreement. The collection and use of information under the Services Agreement may be different than on the Site. The Services Agreement shall take precedence over the terms of this Statement to the extent of any differences, and Customers are advised to read the Services Agreement carefully as it may affect your privacy expectations. 

####  Information We Collect: 

Clickable's main goal in collecting personally identifiable information is to provide our Site and Service to our Customers, to communicate with our Customers, and to allow Customers to manage their participation in such offerings. When accessing certain restricted sections of our Site or responding to our promotions, we require Customers to register to use the services offered on our Site (collectively, the "Service(s)"). Registration is required when visitors to the Site apply to use the Service as Customers during a trial Evaluation Period, and further information may be required to continue paid use of the Service after the Evaluation Period. During registration Customers will be asked to give us certain personally identifiable information, such as their user name, password, name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of users within the organization that will be using the Service ("Registration Data"). To use the Service you will be asked to provide certain Advertising Account information. Clickable will share such Advertising Account information with third party advertising providers as necessary to implement your advertising campaign management decisions. We may also request additional information when you express interest in attaining additional information on our Service, such additional personal information may include, but is not limited to, title, department name, fax number, or additional company information, such as annual revenues, number of employees, or industry. During Customer use of the Site or Service after registration, we may collect additional profiling information to customize the Service to your needs. If you contact us via e-mail through the Site, we may retain a record of your contact information and any information you provide us in your message to respond to you. In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you and provide you with information about our Service and those of our partners. Any additional personally identifiable information you provide will be added to your Registration Data. Customers can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked. In certain cases, your choice not to provide the requested information may mean that the Service or certain features are not available to you or work in a reduced fashion. Customers can update or remove some of their personally identifiable registration data at any time by logging into the Site and editing their User Account. Customers who remove or edit required Customer data, may not be able to receive the Services. Customers can view their updated User Account to confirm their edits have been made unless such edits have caused a removal or discontinuation of the User Account entirely. Clickable reserves the right to withhold or deny the Service to you or any person or entity, or to condition access to all or certain portions of the Site for any reason, including but not limited to your refusal to provide or removal of information Clickable deems necessary to provide the Service or Site access in question. If a User Account has been created on your behalf without your consent, your sole remedy is to contact Clickable at security@Clickable.com and ask that your User Account be disabled and your personally identifiable information and Registration Data be deleted from Clickable's data repository. 

####  How We Use Information: 

Clickable uses the information that we collect to set up the Service for individuals and their organizations, and to transmit certain data and instructions to third party advertising providers upon your request. We may also use the information we collect to contact Customers about the details of Customer's interest in our company, our Service, including promotions and events, and to send information regarding our company or partners. Customers are invited to receive an email newsletter by providing an email address. Customer email addresses and any personal Customer information will not be distributed or shared with third parties except employees, directors, representatives, consultants or agents of Clickable acting on our behalf after agreeing to our privacy policies and procedures. At certain locations on the Site Customers may receive solicitations to participate in third party services. Upon clicking on such third party links, Customers may be redirected to a third party site.
