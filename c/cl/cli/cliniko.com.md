We also automatically receive and record information when you visit our website, such as your IP address and information stored in cookies on your computer hard-drive.

## Use of information

The personal information we collect is used to provide you with services you request and to operate our business efficiently. We use it for billing, identification, authentication, service improvement, research, and also for contacting you when necessary.

We may use your personal information to advise you of new or updated products or services or special offers or promotions that you may be interested in. You can contact us at any time to let us know that you do not want us to use your information for this purpose.

If you do not provide personal information to us we may not be able to provide our services or services most suited to your needs.

## Information Sharing

We may disclose personal information when we believe it violates our Terms of Service, when it is required to assist with a lawful investigation or comply with the law, if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, or if some or all of the assets and operations of our business are or may be transferred to another party.

From time to time third party service providers who assist us with our activities, such as website hosts, IT back-up service providers, and other IT or payment service providers, may also have access to personal information held by us and may use this information on our behalf.

To assist us in improving our products and services, we monitor aggregated data that is collected by our Cliniko application and may share this with third parties collectively and in an anonymous way. This data will not reveal personal information.

We will not sell, rent or share your personal information with third parties in other ways without your consent unless we are entitled by law to do so.

By providing your personal information to us, you consent to us transferring this information to third party IT providers, including our website host and back-up service provider, outside of Australia.

## Storage and protection

We may hold your personal information in electronic databases, such as our customer relationship management system. We take all reasonable steps to keep any personal information we hold about you secure. We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who require that information in order to operate and develop our application and service.
