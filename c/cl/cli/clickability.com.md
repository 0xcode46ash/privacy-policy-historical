# Clickability -- web content management software-as-a-service

On deploying scalable interfaces for CMS's:

"Ask yourself: What happens to my job and the job of the editors and authors when the amount of content in the system increases two-fold? How about five-fold, or ten-fold, or fifty-fold?"

This statement discloses the privacy practices for this entire Web Site, [www.clickability.com](https://web.archive.org/).

When you, as a visitor, visit this Web Site you can surf the site anonymously and access important information without revealing your identity. However, if you are a potential partner or user seeking access to a restricted area, you will be required to identify yourself using pre-agreed login and/or password information. 

Clickability, Inc. ("Clickability") may capture information from users who visit our Web Site for aggregate statistical analysis and Site customization. The information we may capture is data that we can gather about the user without asking them. Aggregate statistical analysis means that Clickability reviews trends based on information as a whole, but does not do so in an effort to identify the individual identity of the visitor to its Site. Clickability collects the visitor's domain name (e.g. whether the user is logged on from generic.com), referral data (e.g. we record the last URL a user viSited prior to clicking to Clickability), as well as browser and platform type (e.g., a Microsoft browser on a Macintosh platform). We also count, track, and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our Sites (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within Clickability.com). When and if Clickability does present aggregated information to outside companies, no one would be able to identify you or contact you. 

IP addresses may be logged to track a user's session. An IP address is the unique numerical identity of your computer. When we "log" an IP address, it means that our Web Site associates a visit or series of visits to that unique numerical identity. Clickability also uses cookies for its Services in order to assist in aggregate statistical analysis and sometimes provide Site customization based on anonymous session tracking. In other words, Clickability uses cookies to determine trends for users as a whole, but not as means to learn about your individual identity. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the actual identity of users. On their own, they can be used to identify a computer, but not who is using that computer. Because of this, if Clickability customizes the Site based on cookies, we won't know who you are unless you tell us. 

Clickability uses links throughout its Web Site to provide a visitor with the opportunity to contact us via email for a variety of purposes (including business development, general inquiries and human resource inquires). Clickability may file information from emails, review and discard the information, and share this information with third parties. Human resource information will not be shared with a third party without the express consent of the individual. 

Finally, Clickability also collects and uses information in the context of the Internet infrastructure services it provides to its clients. The following is a link to the Clickability privacy statement that applies to all Clickability Services:

Clickability employs industry standard physical and computer security practices in order to protect the information it collects and stores. Clickability will disclose information (both personally identifiable and in the aggregate form) if legally required by subpoena, warrant or other legal process that Clickability finds, in its sole discretion, to be valid and enforceable.
