If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy statement or practices, please contact us at [privacy@uplandsoftware.com](mailto:privacy@uplandsoftware.com).

### Collection and Use of Personal Information

We collect the following personal information from you:

  * Contact information such as name, email address, mailing address and phone number
  * As is true of most websites, we automatically gather information about your computer, such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages and operating system, and general geo location (we do not collect precise geo location). We may combine this automatically collected data with other information we collect about you.  We do this to improve marketing and analytics.
  * Unique identifiers such as social security number, employee identification numbers and employee records
  * Device identifiers such as system and performance information when you download and use our Mobile Applications



You can log in to some of our Platforms by using sign-in services through our Client’s website.  These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up forms.

Note that when you are using the Platforms, Upland collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal information it processes.

**We use this information to:**

  * Send you requested product or service information
  * Respond to customer service requests
  * Send you a newsletter and/or marketing emails



We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone.  This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.  We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the Mobile Applications.

You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider.  These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.  Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.

### Choice/Opt-Out

You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or you can contact us at [info@uplandsoftware.com](mailto:info@uplandsoftware.com).

If you are a Client and would like to update your account, please contact us at [info@uplandsoftware.com](mailto:info@uplandsoftware.com).

If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the Client that you interact with directly.  We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service.  Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients.

### Information Sharing

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as offering customer service.  These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

**We may also disclose your personal information:**

  * as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process,
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a government request,
  * if Upland is involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Websites of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,
  * to any other third-party with your prior consent to do so.



### Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Upland and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics and business support service providers.  These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 and Flash to store content information and preferences.  Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 and Flash to collect and store information.  Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.  To manage Flash LSOs, please click the link below.

### Customer Testimonials, Comments and Reviews

We post customer testimonials, comments, and reviews on our Websites, which may contain personal information.  We do obtain the customer’s consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.  If you wish to change or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at [info@uplandsoftware.com](mailto:info@uplandsoftware.com)

Our Websites also offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums.  You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected and used by others who access them.  To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [info@uplandsoftware.com](mailto:info@uplandsoftware.com).  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

### Links to Other Websites

Our Website includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Upland.  If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements.  We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.

Our Websites include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites.  These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.  Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our website.  Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it.

### Security

The security of your personal information is important to us.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  Sensitive information such as user name and password used during log in is transmitted over the internet by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption.

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Websites, Platforms and Mobile Applications, you can contact us at [info@uplandsoftware.com](mailto:info@uplandsoftware.com).

### Additional Policy Information

**Updating/Accessing/Amending/Correcting Personal Information**

If your personal information changes or you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, delete, remove or deactivate it by making the change within your specific application instance, by emailing our Customer Support at [info@uplandsoftware.com](mailto:info@uplandsoftware.com), or by contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below.  We will respond to your request to access within 2 days.

Since Upland has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes, an individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to Upland’s Client (the data controller).  If the Client requests us to remove the data, we will respond to the request within 30 days.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.  We will also retain personal information we process on behalf of our Clients in the aforementioned manner.
