# Clickability | www.clickability.com | Privacy Policy

This privacy statement (“Privacy Policy”) covers all websites owned and operated by Clickability, Inc. (“Clickability”, “we”, “us”, “our”).  Clickability knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.  By visiting the Clickability websites, submitting personal information or using any of our products or services, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.

### What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy covers Clickability’s treatment of personal information that Clickability gathers when you are on the Clickability websites and when you use Clickability products or services.  Also, this Privacy Policy covers Clickability’s treatment of any personal information that Clickability’s business partners share with Clickability.  This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Clickability does not own or control, or to individuals that Clickability does not employ or manage.

### What Personal Information About Users Does Clickability Collect?

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to personalize and improve our websites and services. We collect the following types of personal information from users:

A)  Information You Provide to Us: 

    º We may receive and store any personal information you enter on our websites or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain personal information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of certain site functionality and services.  The personal information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about specials, sales offers and new products.  We use links throughout our websites to provide you with the opportunit    y to contact us via e-mail for a variety of purposes (including without limitation business development, general inquiries and human resource inquires). Your human resource information will not be shared with a third party without your express consent.  We also collect and use personal information in the context of the services we provide to our customers.

    º Registration: Users of certain Clickability services must complete a registration form.  As part of this registration form, we require your first and last name, your e-mail address and other information as required by the specific registration form.

B)   Automatic Information:

    º We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us online.  Clickability may automatically receive and record certain “traffic data” on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Clickability cookie information, and the page you requested.  Clickability uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the websites.  

    º We may capture information when you visit our websites for aggregate statistical analysis and website customization.  Aggregate statistical analysis means that we review trends based on information as a whole, but does not do so in an effort to identify the individual identity of the visitor. We collect your domain name (e.g. whether you are logged on from generic.com), referral data (e.g. we record the last URL you visited prior to clicking to a Clickability website), as well as browser and platform type (e.g., a Microsoft browser on a Macintosh platform). We also count, track and aggregate your activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our websites (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within our websites etc.).

    º  Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously.  While Clickability will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.

(C)   E-mail Communications:

    º  We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Clickability if your computer supports this type of program, in order to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful.  We may also send out e-mails with news or promotions.  If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please follow the instructions contained in that e-mail.

### What about Cookies?

     º  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our websites are visited and by how many people.  Clickability cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your e-mail address is. 

    º  The “help” portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.  We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to use some of Clickability’s products and services.

### Will Clickability Share Any of the Information it Receives?

We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone.  We share your personal information only with your consent or as described below:

    º  Affiliated Business We Do Not Control:

We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them.  You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction.  We will only share personal information that is necessary for the affiliate to complete the transaction.  We require our affiliates to provide the same level of privacy protection that we do and they do not have the right to share or use personal information for any purpose other than for an authorized transaction.

    º Personnel:

Our personnel (including, for the avoidance of doubt, consultants and/or contractors) may have access to user information while carrying out their duties in the normal course of our company business.

    º  Agents:

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your personal information with them to provide products or services to you.  You hereby consent to our sharing of your personal information for the above purposes. 

    º Business Transfers:

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.  In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.  Moreover, if Clickability, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.

   º Protection of Clickability and Others:

We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Clickability, our employees, our users or others.  This includes exchanging personal information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

### Is Information About Me Secure?

For users of certain Clickability services, your Clickability account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security.  You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.

    º  We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to protect the security of your personal information during transmission, which encrypts all of the personal information you input.

    º  Only Clickability employees who need personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to it.  All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.

### What Information Can I Access?

For users of certain Clickability services, you can access your personal information on our websites and correct, amend, or delete personal information that is inaccurate. 

### What Choices Do I Have?

    º  As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose personal information, but then you may be unable to use certain features on our websites or certain Clickability services.

    º  For users of certain Clickability services, you may be able to add or update certain personal information.  When you update personal information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised personal information in our records.  Please note that some personal information may remain in our records after deletion of your account. 

    º  If you do not wish to receive e-mail from us, please follow the instructions contained in that e-mail.  Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Clickability websites and applicable services, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.

    º  As explained earlier, the “help” portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. Please note, however, that if your browser does not accept cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of some of our attractive features.

### Does Clickability Collect Personal Information from Children?

Clickability does not specifically collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

### Conditions of Use

If you decide to visit the Clickability websites, your visit and any possible dispute over privacy are subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of California state law. 

### Third Party Websites

The Clickability websites and services may permit you to link to other websites on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to the Clickability websites.  These other websites are not under Clickability control.  The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the Clickability websites and services are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and Clickability is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

Clickability may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its sole discretion.  Use of personal information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such personal information is used.  If we make changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Clickability websites so you are always aware of what personal information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if any, it is disclosed.
