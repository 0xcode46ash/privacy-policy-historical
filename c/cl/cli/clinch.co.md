# Clinch Privacy Policy

Clinch Privacy Policy
We respect your privacy and will not share your private information with people you don't
choose to share it with.
Clinch's Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal
information you decide to share, and help you make informed decisions when using Clinch
applications or accessing www.clinch.co (the “Site” or “Clinch”).
By using Clinch applications or accessing the Site, you are accepting the practices described in
this Privacy Policy.
If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact us at
privacy@clinch.co.
The Information We Collect
When you register with Clinch, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your
name, username, your email address and a photo representation ("avatar") and any other
personal or preference information that you provide to us.
When you launch a Clinch application you provide us with four types of information: personal
information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us; location-based use
information collected by us as you interact with our services; usage information that is collected
by our servers as you use our applications; and information related to third party services that
you would like to access through our applications and services.
In serving you, Clinch may use or store your precise geographic location, if you give permission
to do so. Clinch applications do not use or share this data for any other purpose. Many devices
will indicate through an icon when location services are operating. Clinch applications only
share this location information with others as approved by you.
When you launch or interact with Clinch applications, we collect your device type and IP
address. This information is gathered for all users. We use the User ID, created in Clinch
applications, to authenticate the user session. If you have questions or concerns regarding this
statement, you should contact us at privacy@clinch.co.


When you use Clinch applications, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships,
send messages, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information
so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain
it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior videos or messages you have posted or
easily see the list of people you follow or follow you. When you update information, we usually
keep a backup copy of the prior version for 90 days to enable reversion to the prior version of
that information.
Clinch Services involve the aggregation and consolidation of user content, from a number of
users, and content from third parties, into one product. If not determined by you as ‘Private’,
your user content can be combined with other Clinch applications users’ content. You post user
content through Clinch applications at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other
users with whom you may choose to share your information. Therefore, we cannot and do not
guarantee that user content you post with Clinch will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.
We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained
in Clinch applications. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of
user content may remain viewable in cached and archived form or if other users have copied or
stored your user content.
Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on Clinch applications is a violation of
the Clinch Terms of Service and should be reported to privacy@clinch.co.
If you choose to use our invitation service, we may ask you for information needed to send the
invitation, such as the recipient's email address and we will automatically send a one-time email
or instant message inviting the recipient to visit the site or to download our application. Clinch
stores this information to send this one-time invitation, to register a new connection if your
invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. The person you invited
may contact us at privacy@clinch.co to request that we remove this information from our
databases.
Clinch may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs,
instant messaging services, and other users of Clinch applications through the operation of the
service in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized
experience. By using Clinch, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and
processed in the United States.
Third Party Services Accessed by Clinch
You can configure certain third party services to be accessed by Clinch applications and
services. When you do so, we will store your access credentials to such third party services in a
secure manner; we may temporarily cache your list of contacts from these services; and we will
store messages, videos, and other content created using our applications that are delivered to


such third party services. We do this to improve the performance and experience of these
services (such as, adding videos and location information not available in the third party
services).
Use of Information Obtained by Clinch
When you register with Clinch, you create your own profile.
Your name / username, location (at registration) and avatar (but not email address) are
displayed to other Clinch users to enable you to connect with others on Clinch. We expect that
you will use the name, which you are most commonly known by. We may occasionally use your
username or email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by Clinch
that we think you may find valuable.
Your profile can be shared across all the applications in the Clinch portfolio. As a previously
registered user, when you download and access a new Clinch application, your user profile is
automatically incorporated into that new application.
By registering with Clinch, you understand that we may send you communications or data from
www.clinch.co regarding service related announcements from time to time through the general
operation of the service, including but not limited to: (i) notices about your use of our services,
including any notices concerning violations of use; (ii) updates; and (iii) promotional information
and materials regarding clinch.coʼs products and services, via electronic mail. For instance, if a
person you follow posts a new video, you may receive an email or other notification alerting you
to that fact. We give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving electronic mail from us by
following the opt-out instructions provided in the message, and/or in the settings of the
applications
Clinch may use information in your profile or related to your activities on Clinch applications in
order to personalize the application experience for you. Clinch may also share information such
as user trends and application downloads in aggregate to third parties without identifying you as
an individual.
Sharing Your Information with Third Parties
Clinch is about users sharing information with others.
We do not share contact information (such as name, address, email or phone) with other
companies for marketing purposes without your permission. We share your information with
trusted third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is: 1)
necessary for business operations (e.g., emailing you through a third party server), 2) legally
required or when we choose to collaborate with a law enforcement agency in the investigation of
a possible crime, 3) permitted by you. We require that these parties agree to process such
information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other
appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We also require opt-in consent for the sharing


of any sensitive personal information. We will only share this information if we obtain
assurances from such third parties that they will safeguard personal information through
measures consistent with this Privacy Policy. Where we have knowledge that a third party is
using or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to this Privacy Policy, we will take
commercially reasonable steps to prevent or stop the unauthorized use or disclosure.
If the ownership of Clinch Labs ltd. were to change, your user information may be transferred to
the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your
user information would remain subject to the promises made in any preexisting Privacy Policy. If
Clinch Labs becomes involved in such a change of ownership, we will provide notice to you
before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
You hereby agree that any data obtained from you may be used for the purposes set forth in
this Privacy Policy, including without limitation for providing the Services.
Data Integrity, Accessing, Changing or Removing Information
The Company processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected
and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service agreements. We review our
data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and
process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take
reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and
current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever
necessary.
Upon receipt of your written request and enough information to permit us to identify your
personal information, we will disclose to you the information we hold about you. We will also
correct, amend or delete any personal information that is inaccurate and notify any third party
recipients of the necessary changes.
Clinch users may view, modify or delete any personally identifiable information Clinch
applications have stored (such as name, address, phone number) at any time by signing into
their account. Information will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their
Clinch account may do so by deleting their account in the applications or by emailing us
at privacy@clinch.co. Removed information may persist in backup copies for 90 days, but will
not be generally available to members of Clinch.
We do not charge for complying with a correction request, however, for all other requests, we
may charge a small fee to cover its costs. Requests to delete personal information are subject to
any applicable legal and ethical reporting or document retention obligations imposed on the
Company.


We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed,
corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process
requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort,
jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not
otherwise required.
Clinch Services and applications have communication features that allow you to share
information with other individuals on Clinch; however, you generally cannot remove such
communications.
Please contact us at the above address for any additional questions or to access and update
personal information.
Analytics
Analytics companies may access anonymous, aggregated non-personal data (such as your IP
address or device ID) to help us understand how our services are used. They use this data
solely on our behalf. They do not share it except in aggregate form; no data is shared as to any
individual user. If you have any questions about the information analytics companies have
access to, please contact us at privacy@clinch.co.
Cookies
In order to collect the anonymous data described herein, we may use temporary “cookies” that
remain in the cookies file of your browser until the browser is closed. Cookies by themselves
cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. A cookie is a small piece of information,
which is sent to your browser and stored on your computerʼs hard drive. Cookies do not damage
your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This enables
you to decide if you want to accept it or not.
Security
Clinch takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information against unauthorized
access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. Your account information
is located on a secured server or is hosted by a third party cloud service provider such as
Amazon. Clinch does not run and cannot guarantee the security of third party cloud service
providers.
Information we collect may be stored or processed on computers located in any country where
we do business.
We strive to maintain the reliability, accuracy, completeness and currency of personal
information that we collect and to protect the privacy and security of our customers. We keep


your personal information only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it
was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention
requirements.
We limit access to personal information about you to employees, contractors and agents who
we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information. These individuals are
bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and
criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
We have physical, electronic, and procedural security measures and safeguards to reasonably
protect personal information. Our servers and our databases are protected by industry standard
security technology, such as industry standard firewalls and password protection.
Although we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or
destruction of data, we try to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.
If you have any questions about the security of Clinch applications, please contact us
at privacy@clinch.co.
Children
Clinch does not knowingly contact, collect or retain personal information from children under 13
years of age. Any person who provides their personal information to Clinch through its services
must be 13 years of age or older. If we learn that personal information of persons under the age
of 13 years has been collected on one of our services we will take the appropriate steps to
delete this information. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please
contact us so we can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.
If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained a
Service account, then you may alert us at privacy@clinch.co and request that we delete that
child's personal information from our systems.
