##  Core Liquidity Markets Pty Ltd (CLM)

**Protecting the privacy and safeguarding the personal and financial information of our clients and website visitors is one of our highest priorities. The following privacy statement explains how CLM collects and protects your information.**

By opening a CLM account or by using CLM sites, you give your consent to the collection and use of personal information by CLM as explained in this Privacy Statement.

## Collection of Personal Information

We collect information required to open an account, to transact business effectively, and to safeguard your privacy. To do this, we gather information to help us assess your needs and preferences.

The information we collect directly from you includes information required to communicate with you, including your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address. And, as required by law to identify who you are, we also collect your Passport/Tax ID number, address, etc. We also collect demographic information when you open an account, including gender, birth date, education, occupation, etc. Our regulatory bodies also require us to assess your trading experience, your approximate annual income, approximate net worth, and available risk capital to assess your financial position.

You directly provide to us the majority of information we collect. You do this by completing the account application and related documentation, placing a trade, sending us an e-mail or submitting information in response to a promotion or special offer. Other ways we obtain information are by (1) observing your usage of the website, and (2) providing products and services to you. This information enables us to offer you products and services that should be of interest to you. The information we collect indirectly from you includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, Internet Service Provider (ISP), time stamps, transactions placed, and banner ads you click. We do this through the use of cookies, which are small text files sent from the web server to your computer. Cookies help us to know you better by providing operational data we can use to aid your interaction with our website and improve its navigation and usability.

## Usage of Personal Information

We use personal information only as appropriate to provide you quality service and security. For example, CLM may use the information collected from you to verify your identity and contact information. W e may also use this information to establish and set up your trading account, issue an account number and a secure password, maintain your account activity, and contact you with account information. This information helps us improve our services to you, customize your browsing experience and inform you about additional products, services or promotions that may be of interest to you.

Should you close your account with us, CLM will retain your information, but only use it to comply with regulatory requirements and to periodically contact you to offer you the opportunity to reactivate your account or participate in other valuable offers.

CLM may share information with affiliates if the information is required to provide the product or service you have requested or to provide you the opportunity to participate in the products or services our affiliates offer. CLM also forges partnerships and alliances, which may include joint marketing agreements, with other companies who offer high-quality products and services that might be of value to our clients. In order to ensure that these products and services meet your needs and are delivered in a manner that is useful and relevant, CLM may share some information with partners, affiliates and alliances. This allows them to better understand the offers that are most relevant and useful. In our strategic relationships, we will require that it be identified that an offer is being extended because of the relationship with us. The use of your personal information is limited to the purposes identified in our relationship with the partner or affiliate.

To help us improve our services to you, we may engage another business to help us to carry out certain internal functions such as account processing, fulfillment, client service, client satisfaction surveys or other data collection activities relevant to our business. We may also provide a party with client information from our database to help us to analyse and identify client needs and notify clients of product and service offerings. Use of the information shared is strictly limited to the performance of the task we request and for no other purpose. All third parties with which we share personal information are required to protect personal information in a manner similar to the way we protect personal information. Examples of information shared are identifying information such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, and information on account activity.

If at any time you choose to purchase a product or service offered by another company, any personal information you share with that company will no longer be controlled under our Privacy Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of sites we link to and have no control of the use or protection of information provided by you or collected b y those sites. Whenever you elect to link to a co-branded Web site or to a linked website, you may be asked to provide registration or other information.

You may direct us not to disclose non-public personal information to certain non-affiliated third parties. To opt out of sharing non-public personal information with non-affiliated third parties, please contact a client service representative. An opt-out election made by one account owner of a Joint account is applicable to all account owners of the Joint account. An opt-out election must be made for each separate account you hold at CLM.
