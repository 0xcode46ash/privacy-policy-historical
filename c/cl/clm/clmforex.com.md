17. Internal Procedure for Dealing with
Communications
The three key steps Core Liquidity Markets follows:
1. Consent – Only commercial electronic messages are sent
     with the addressee’s consent – either express or inferred
     consent.
2. Identify – Electronic messages will include clear and
     accurate information about the person and the company
     that is responsible for sending the commercial electronic
     message.
3. Unsubscribe – We ensure that a functional unsubscribe
     facility is included in all our commercial electronic
     messages and deal with unsubscribe requests promptly.
18. Consented to Such Communications
Commercial messages will only be sent to you when you have
given consent.
This may be express consent – a direct indication that it is
okay to send the message, or messages of that nature or
inferred consent based on our business or other relationship
with you and your conduct.
