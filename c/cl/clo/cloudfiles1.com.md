# Privacy policy | Cloud Files

We respect the confidentiality of information relating to our readers, as well as the laws governing the privacy of medical information that apply in the country and state where this website is located.

We also respect clarity of speech and have made an effort to clearly and simply explain to you how and why we and other third-parties use information collected about you when you visit this website.

In short: information identifying individual Kozmetika Samantha visitors and account holders will not be disclosed by Kozmetika Samantha staff to anyone unless specifically authorized by that individual. 

Your email address and personal details are never passed on, or sold, to third-parties. These details are used only to supply Kozmetika Samantha services requested by you and for our own statistical analysis. 

For example, our email-a-friend service uses your name and email address, as well as the email address and name of the person you wish to forward an Kozmetika Samantha news article to. We do not store this information, nor do we associate it with your Kozmetika Samantha account, should you have one.

Please read the rest of the document to familiarize yourself with where and how we collect and use your data, as well as how our advertisers and other service providers deal with your personal data.

Please be aware that by continuing to use Kozmetika Samantha, you consent to our usage of the methods described here.

## Our use of cookies

In order for us to count the number of people visiting Kozmetika Samantha, a unique “cookie” may be placed in your web browser. The cookie settings that we use are automatically set to “allow all cookies” in order to give you the best visitor experience.

Here is a list of the cookies that we place, how long they are active for and why we use them: 

**Kozmetika Samantha account “remember me”  
**If you check the “Remember me” box on any of our log-in forms, we will set a cookie to remember your email and password information for 14 days. This means that even if you close your web browser and come back at another time within 14 days, we’ll automatically enter these details for you. After 14 days have passed, you’ll have to check the box again in order to save your details for another 14 days.

**Mobile website override**  
We understand that not everyone wants to see a stripped-down version of our Kozmetika Samantha when browsing a mobile device. So, if you click on the yellow “View desktop website” button at the bottom of every page when viewing Kozmetika Samantha on a mobile device, we’ll send you to the “full” version of Kozmetika Samantha and set a cookie to remember your choice. Should you quit your mobile device’s web browser, you’ll be presented with the mobile version of Kozmetika Samantha next time you visit us. 

Aside from these two cookies, we also track visitor IP addresses for the purposes of attaining demographic data and to aid us in reporting and stopping inappropriate use of the website.

Please see the sections below for further specific information on how our advertisers and other third-party partners collect and use information about you and your visit to Kozmetika Samantha.
