## Privacy Policy

Wednesday 29 November 2006

##### Confidentiality is Guaranteed

Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. Signing up for membership of Closerdiets.com requires us to ask you for certain confidential information, including your name and email address. This is entirely to enable us to create a personalised programme on your behalf and we guarantee your details will not, under any circumstances, be passed on to third parties.

Please be aware that if you submit information to the members' message board your anonymity cannot always be maintained.

You can include your email address if you wish but are not obliged to do so. While this area is moderated by Closerdiets.com technicians to prevent inappropriate messages from being posted, we cannot safeguard against unsolicited third party emails if an address has been supplied. So do be careful - and take care in turn not to violate the rights of others.
