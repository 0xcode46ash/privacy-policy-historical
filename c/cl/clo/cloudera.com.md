This Data Policy (the “Policy”) describes Cloudera’s policy for handling, storing, and otherwise treating certain types of data of Cloudera’s customers (each, a “Customer”), including data associated with individual users and employees of Customer organizations, in each case pursuant to a Customer Agreement (as defined below).  “Cloudera” means Cloudera, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates.

Additional policies that apply to specific Cloudera Products and Services can be found at the end of this Policy, in the section entitled “Service-Specific Terms.”

#### OVERVIEW

Cloudera collects information that a Customer or other data sources send to Cloudera as part of such Customer’s use of Cloudera Products and Services.  This data is addressed in three categories, “Transaction Data”, “Account Data” and “Personal Data”, each as defined below.  
 

#### TRANSACTION DATA AND ACCOUNT DATA

**Security**

Cloudera understands the sensitive nature of the data that Customer or Customer’s organization may provide while using Cloudera Products and Services.  Cloudera will maintain commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards designed for the protection, confidentiality and integrity of Customer’s Transaction Data and Account Data.

**Data Use by Cloudera**

_Access._  Cloudera places strict controls over its employees’ access to Customer’s Transaction Data and Account Data that resides in the Cloudera Products and Services, and is committed to ensuring that Customer’s Transaction Data and Account Data is not used by anyone who should not have access to it.  The operation of the Cloudera Products and Services requires that some employees have access to Customer systems which store and process Customer’s Transaction Data and Account Data. For example, in order to diagnose a problem Customer is having with Cloudera Products and Services, the Cloudera support team may need to access Customer’s Transaction Data.  These employees are prohibited from using these permissions to view Customer’s Transaction Data unless it is necessary to do so.

_Ownership._  As between Cloudera and Customer, Customer or its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Transaction Data and Account Data.  Cloudera obtains no ownership rights under this Agreement from Customer or its licensors to any Transaction Data or Account Data.

_Use of Transaction Data._  Cloudera will treat Transaction Data as confidential and will use it only to: (i) facilitate operation of the Cloudera Products and Services; (ii) enhance the use of the Cloudera Products and Services and its related web pages; (iii) perform internal tracking to improve Cloudera Products and Services; (iv) analyze the extent to which Customers use Cloudera Products and Services; (v) enable Cloudera to contact its Customers; (vi) process, bill and invoice Customer’s transactions for Cloudera Products and Services usage; (vii) make backups in order to prevent data loss; and (viii) comply with the law or a binding order of a governmental body.   This permission includes allowing us to use third-party service providers in the operation and administration of Cloudera Products and Services and the rights granted to us are extended to these third parties to the degree necessary in order for Cloudera Products and Services to be provided. The Privacy Policy does not apply to Transaction Data.

_Use of Account Data._  Cloudera will only use Account Data in accordance with the Privacy Policy, and Customer consents to such usage.

_Feedback._  If any Customer users provide Cloudera with any feedback, support tickets, reported defects, usability enhancements, feature requests or suggestions regarding Cloudera Products and Services, Customer grants Cloudera an unlimited, irrevocable, perpetual, free license to use any such feedback or suggestions for any purpose without any obligation to Customer.

**Retention of Transaction Data and Account Data**

Data collected by Cloudera as part of diagnostic bundles will be retained for a period of 12 months.  All other Transaction Data and Account Data may be retained no longer than as permitted by governing law, but in no event longer than for the life of the related Cloudera product + 10 years.  


_Incident Management and Response_

In the event of a security breach involving Cloudera Products and Services, Cloudera will promptly notify each affected Customer of any unauthorized access to any of such Customer’s Transaction Data or Account Data that was stored in Cloudera Products and Services.  Cloudera has internal incident management procedures in place to handle such an event.  


_Product Security Practices_

New features, functionality, and design changes go through a security review process facilitated by Cloudera’s security team.  The security team works closely with development teams to resolve any additional security concerns that may arise during development.  
 

#### PERSONAL DATA

Cloudera’s current Privacy Policy is incorporated into this document and includes important terms regarding Cloudera’s handling of Personal Data.  The sections above relating to Incident Management and Response and Product Security Practices also apply to Personal Data.  
 

#### CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES

**Customer Account and Account Data**

To access certain Cloudera Online Services, Customer may be asked to create a Cloudera account associated with a valid e-mail address (a “Customer Account”).  Customer may only create one account per email address. Customer is responsible for: (i) maintaining the confidentiality of the Account Data, (ii) monitoring and controlling which end users have access to the Customer Account; and (iii) all activities that occur under the Customer Account, regardless of whether the activities are undertaken by Customer, Customer’s employees or a third party (including Customer’s contractors or agents).  Except to the extent caused by Cloudera’s breach of this Data Policy, Cloudera and its Affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to the Customer Account. Customer will contact Cloudera immediately if Customer believes an unauthorized third party may be using the Customer Account or if Customer’s Account Information is lost or stolen.

**Acceptable Use**

Customer must not: (i) use, or encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to use, Cloudera Products and Services for any illegal, harmful or offensive use, or to transmit, store, display, distribute or otherwise make available content that is illegal, harmful, or offensive; (ii) use Cloudera Products and Services to violate the security or integrity of any network, computer or communications system, software application, or network or computing device; (iii) make network connections to any users, hosts, or networks unless Customer has permission to communicate with them; (iv) use Cloudera Products and Services to transmit spam, bulk or unsolicited communications; or (v) use Cloudera Products and Services to collect and store personally identifiable information about any person unless specifically authorized by such person.  


**Transaction Data, Account Data and Personal Data**

  * compliance with the Acceptable Use provisions herein;
  * compliance with all applicable laws;

SERVICE-SPECIFIC TERMS

**Cloudera Navigator Optimizer and Workload Analytics**

_Data Use._  Cloudera’s Navigator Optimizer service (“Optimizer”) and Workload Analytics service (“Workload Analytics”) do not collect or store any Personal Data or Customer Data.  These services may collect and/or store certain types of Transaction Data such as Customer’s queries or workload information (“Analytics Data”). While Analytics Data is confidential information and will be protected pursuant to the provisions in this policy that apply to Transaction Data, Optimizer and Workload Analytics are not databases of record for the storage of Analytics Data.  Retention of this Analytics Data is not Cloudera’s responsibility.

_Availability._  Cloudera is committed to making Optimizer and Workload Analytics highly-available services that Customers can count on.  To the extent feasible, Cloudera’s infrastructure runs on systems that are fault-tolerant, for failures of individual servers.  Cloudera’s operations team tests disaster-recovery measures regularly and staffs a team to quickly resolve unexpected incidents.  However, at this time Cloudera makes no uptime or availability guarantees with respect to Optimizer or Workload Analytics or retention of Analytics Data.
