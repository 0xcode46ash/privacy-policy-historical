# Cloudera Privacy Policy | Cloudera

[](https://web.archive.org/)

At Cloudera, your privacy is important to us. We want you to clearly understand what information we collect, and how we use such information.

**Cookies**

When you visit Cloudera's website, we may set a cookie on your browser. We also use Google Analytics, which sets a cookie to identify unique users. We currently do not use this information for anything other than monitoring traffic to our website.

**Forms and Surveys**

We occasionally use forms and surveys to gather feedback from users. Any information you provide is stored securely, and is never shared with third parties not directly involved in data collection, except in aggregate. For example, sometimes we use Google spreadsheets which stores information on Google servers, but we do not share that data with any user outside the cloudera.com domain.

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**

Cloudera does not collect any personally identifiable information without your knowledge, and allows you to control how we use that information. All PII is stored in secure systems, and is never shared outside Cloudera.
