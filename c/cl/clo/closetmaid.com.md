**Privacy Policy**

ClosetMaid respects the individuals who visit our website and/or receive our electronic communications. ClosetMaid will not share or sell a user's email address or other specific personal information for marketing purposes. This Privacy statement will explain what user information is collected, how the information is used, saved and protected. It will also explain how to correct or remove personal information from our records. 

  1. **User Information Collected:**  
Personal information such as name, address, phone number and email address is entered voluntarily on our website. In any area of our website where personal data is collected a check box option is available allowing the user to decide whether or not they would like to receive any form of contact from ClosetMaid in the future. 

Through the usage of "cookies", we track the places you visited on our site. This allows your visit to the site to be customized if you so choose. Your browser can be set to notify you when you receive a cookie and then you can decide whether or not to accept it. 

  2. **Information Usage:**  
Our goal in collecting personal information is to process the information to better understand the needs of our consumers and how we can improve our products and services. When a consumer chooses to receive information from ClosetMaid, we plan to provide newsletters, new product announcements, services and special offerings. 

  3. **Records Saved and Secure:**  
User information is kept secure in a fully protected hosting environment. Credit Card authorizations (when ordering a Professional Design) are handled directly by Verisign. That data is not stored by ClosetMaid. 

**Any personal information voluntarily provided by a user to ClosetMaid is never sold or shared with 3rd parties.**

  4. **Updating or Removing Personal Information:**  
You may update, change or remove your record from our database by using My ClosetMaid on [www.closetmaid.com](http://www.closetmaid.com/).
