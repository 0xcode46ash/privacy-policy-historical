Clon Communications knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting any of the sites offered by Clon Communications, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy  
Notice. For question on the Privacy Notice please contact [info@cloncom.com](mailto:%22info@cloncom.com%22).

This Privacy Policy has been created by Clon Communications to inform you about our current data collection and how we use your personal information. Clon Communications may, from time to time, without notice, modify or eliminate all or a portion of this Privacy Policy.   
We obtain personal information that is needed to provide you with our products. When Clon Communications collects information directly from you, we obtain this personal information in order to provide you with our goods or services, to provide customer service and to fulfill any legal or regulatory requirements. We also obtain personal information as a result of consumers' financial transactions with Clon Communications or with Clon Communications merchants. When we obtain information about consumers and merchants from third parties, we use sources that we believe are reputable, including public repositories.  
The only information we collect about you is information that you provide us. This information may include, for example, your name, mailing address, e-mail address and telephone number. If you supply us with personal data and request information from us, we will contact you to provide you with the information you requested. We may also send you other information about Clon Communications and its products or services that we believe you would find interesting or helpful.  
We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your personal information.  
Clon Communications' policies limit access to the personal information we collect to those Clon Communications employees and Clon Communications business relationships who need the information to fulfill their business responsibilities. We require our employees to adhere to Clon Communications's Privacy Policy. Employees who violate the Clon Communications Privacy Policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.

We also will disclose information in response to a request issued by a court, government agency or regulatory authority.  
We will inform you about the general uses of the information we collect about you.  
When we have a direct customer relationship with you, we will strive to make information available to you about the general uses of the information we collect. This information is made available at the point of sale, through privacy notices on our Web sites, in other formats that are publicly available or through other means specified by applicable state and federal laws. In addition, when Clon Communications obtains personal information about consumers indirectly through our merchants, we require our merchants to provide these consumers with their own timely and complete privacy notice.  
When we obtain personal information as part of our direct relationship with you, we will not share this information with nonaffiliated third parties, except in the following circumstances:  
\- In accordance with the Clon Communications Privacy Policy  
\- To facilitate and complete merchant-initiated or authorized transactions  
\- To comply with federal, state and local laws, including credit reporting laws and card association rules  
\- To combat fraud  
\- To offer products and services that Clon Communications believes may be of interest to you.  
Since your needs may change, and Clon Communications continuously develops new products and services, we may contact you to determine if we can provide you with additional services. Most of our customers appreciate hearing about our new products and services and prefer that we continue to contact them. If you would prefer not to be contacted we will make information available to you about how you may request to have your name removed from any Clon Communications owned marketing lists.  
We maintain procedures to assure the quality of information we collect and, in some instances, we inform you how you can access your information and make corrections, if necessary.  
Clon Communications employs appropriate measures to assure the quality of information that we collect directly from you.
