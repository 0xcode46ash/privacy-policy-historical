Clon Communications is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site www.cloncom.com. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.  
If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact our Customer Support Department here. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe <http://truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php>.

We obtain personal information that is needed to provide you with our products. When Clon Communications collects information directly from you, we obtain this personal information in order to provide you with our goods or services, to provide customer service and to fulfill any legal or regulatory requirements. We also obtain personal information as a result of consumers' financial transactions with Clon Communications or with Clon Communications merchants. When we obtain information about consumers and merchants from third parties, we use sources that we believe are reputable, including public repositories.

The only information we collect about you is information that you provide us. This information may include, for example, your name, mailing address, e-mail address and telephone number. Financial information will also be collected when you purchase in our sites, which can of course be stored in your profile or not, as you prefer. If you supply us with personal data and request information from us, we will contact you to provide you with the information you requested. We may also send you other information about Clon Communications and its products or services that we believe you would find interesting or helpful.

|  We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your personal information   
| 

Clon Communications' policies limit access to the personal information we collect to those Clon Communications employees who need the information to fulfill their business responsibilities. Clon Communications does not share your personal information with any third party. We require our employees to adhere to Clon Communications's Privacy Policy. Employees who violate the Clon Communications Privacy Policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site. 

When we have a direct customer relationship with you, we will strive to make information available to you about the general uses of the information we collect. This information is made available at the point of sale, through privacy notices on our Web sites, in other formats that are publicly available or through other means specified by applicable state and federal laws. In addition, when Clon Communications obtains personal information about consumers indirectly through our merchants, we require our merchants to provide these consumers with their own timely and complete privacy notice. 

When we obtain personal information as part of our direct relationship with you, we will not share this information with nonaffiliated third parties, except in the following circumstances: 

\- In accordance with the Clon Communications Privacy Policy  
\- To facilitate and complete merchant-initiated or authorized transactions  
\- To comply with federal, state and local laws, including credit reporting laws and card association rules  
\- To combat fraud  
\- To offer products and services that Clon Communications believes may be of interest to you.

Since your needs may change, and Clon Communications continuously develops new products and services, we may contact you to determine if we can provide you with additional services. Most of our customers appreciate hearing about our new products and services and prefer that we continue to contact them. If you would prefer not to be contacted, you'll have the corresponding instructions in each email, and you can also contact us by email [here](https://web.archive.org/support/contact_us_email.jsp).  
To modify your personal information stored in your account, you will have to log into your account normally (with your email and password) and go to "Edit your Account" under "My Account". You can also contact us by email [here](https://web.archive.org/support/contact_us_email.jsp) with your desired changes to your information.

At Clon Communications security is important. Clon Communications employs appropriate measures, including advanced technology, to protect personal information collected against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. These measures may include, among others, encryption, physical access security and other appropriate technologies. Clon Communications continually reviews and enhances its security systems, as necessary.

|  How the Clon Communications Privacy Policy applies to you  
| 

The examples contained in this Privacy Policy are illustrations only, and they are not intended to be all-inclusive. If you decide to close your merchant account or become an inactive customer, or if we close or suspend your account, our Privacy Policy, as it may exist from time to time, will continue to apply. You may have other privacy protections under state laws, and we will comply with applicable state laws when we disclose information about you. This Privacy Policy applies to all accounts you may have with us, and replaces all our previous disclosures about our information practices. 

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.  
  
  |    
| **Choice/Opt-out**  
  | 

If you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.

| **Tell-A-Friend**

  | 

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). 

We will use this information solely to notify winners and award prizes. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.
