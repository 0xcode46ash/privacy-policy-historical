# cloudHQ - Privacy & Security

Overview

July 7, 2013 

Our Privacy policy is simple. Any information we receive from you will not be shared with anyone else, and we'll never use it for anything else without your consent. For example, we don't share your private information with advertisers or third parties. 

Best practices are followed to ensure your data remains private and secure. 

Security

The following best practices are followed to ensure your data remains private and secure: 

  * cloudHQ uses [Google Federated Login](http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OpenID.html) password-less authentication for user authentication. This means that somebody can access your cloudHQ account **if and only if** that person is logged into your google account.
  * cloudHQ uses industry standard [OAuth](http://www.oauth.net/) password-less authorization protocol when connecting to Google Docs and Dropbox. This means cloudHQ has **no access** to your passwords for these services. 
  * Since Basecamp and SugarSync do not support [OAuth](http://www.oauth.net/), cloudHQ requires users to specify their username and password. These credentials are securely stored on cloudHQ secure storage and encrypted with 256-bit AES encryption.
  * cloudHQ does not permanently store your files. When cloudHQ access your data via API, it might temporary cache part of the content, but cloudHQ never stores any of your files permanently on its servers. 
  * All 256-bit AES keys for encryption and decryption of user's credentials are encrypted and stored in a special "wallet". This wallet is encrypted using a password which is not stored on any of our servers. The password to open this wallet is known only to the cloudHQ administrator who manages our production server.
  * Communication between cloudHQ servers and Google Docs, SugarSync, Basecamp, and Dropbox is always done over a secure SSL channel.
  * Communication between cloudHQ servers and your browser is always done over a secure SSL channel.
  * Our product software and infrastructure is updated regularly with the latest security patches. Our network is protected by an enterprise-class firewall.



The Information We Collect And Store

We may collect and store the following information when running the cloudHQ Service: 

When you register an account, we collect some personal information, such as your name, email address. Payment is handled by PayPal so we are not storing credit card or other billing information. 

When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your web browser. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, and locale preferences. 

We also use “cookies”. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and authenticaion information for future logins to the Service. We also use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you will not be able to use the Service. This cookie persists in your browser, and you can delete these cookies using your browser settings. 

Data Retention

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, you may delete your account. We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
