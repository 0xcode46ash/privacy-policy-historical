# CloudMagic - Privacy policy

##### Introduction

This policy describes what information we collect when you use our service and how we use this information collected. We are not in the business of loaning, renting or selling information to others. We only use the information collected to better the service offered to you. 

##### Your privacy is important to us

Webyog, Inc. is committed to protect your privacy. Through the CloudMagic website and mobile apps, we collect two types of user information : General Statistical Information and Personal Identifying Information. 

##### Collection, Use and Disclosure of General Statistical Information

When you visit our website we gather certain general information, such as number of hits on our website and usage statistics with respect to our software products. This information is referred to throughout this policy as "General Statistical Information". We use and store this data only on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us to determine how and the extent to which certain parts of our website and software are used. The stored General Statistical Information does not contain any Personal Identifying Information about you or any of our other users. 

##### Collection and Use of Personal Identifying Information

In addition to collecting General Statistical Information, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information. Information that can reasonably be used to identify you is referred to in this policy as "Personal Identifying Information" 

  1. Account Info

We ask for your email address when you sign up. This email address is used as your username for your CloudMagic account. 
  

  2. Service Authentication and Data

Services are added to CloudMagic through OAuth authentication. OAuth is a secure mechanism which gives us access to your data without letting us know your password. We then create an index of your data & the index is stored in our servers. When you search on CloudMagic, the search results are populated from this index. 
  

  3. Support Queries

The support queries you write to us might contain personal information. We use this solely to help you resolve the issues reported and improve the product quality. 



##### Disclosure of Personal Identifying Information

We may disclose your Personal Identifying Information to third parties if we are required to do so by law, or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with legal processes such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order. 

We never loan, rent or sell your Personal Identifying Information to others. 

##### Third Party websites

The CloudMagic website may contain links to third-party websites over which we have no control or responsibility regarding content, privacy policies, or practices. We suggest that you review the privacy policy applicable to any third party site that you visit. This privacy policy applies only to our own website at http://cloudmagic.com. 

##### Changes to the Webyog Privacy Policy

Webyog may amend this policy at any time by posting the amended terms on our website. All amended terms will be automatically effective without further notice, 30 days after they are first posted.
