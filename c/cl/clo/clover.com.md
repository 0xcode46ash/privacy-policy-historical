### Information Collection and Use

**Personally Identifiable Information.** In connection with your use of Clover Services, we may ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Information") or your business (“Company Information”). Personal Information and Company information includes, but is not limited to, name, phone number, Clover Account password, bank information, Federal Tax ID number, email addresses, home and business postal addresses and other personal information associated with your Clover Account (collectively, an "Account Profile"). We also collect non-identifying information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your Account Profile, including without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences). We use your Personal and/or Company Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your non-identifying information) to provide Clover related services, complete transactions, administer payments, address your inquiries, and contact you regarding Clover Account activities or communications relevant to your use of Clover Services. Except as explicitly stated herein, Clover will not share the Personal Information part of your Account Profile with third parties.

**Log Data.** When you use Clover Services, our servers automatically record information that your browser or Registered Device sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, the geographic location of the IP address you are using to access the Internet, browser type, operating system, the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and for the Site's technical administration, to increase our Site's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs.

**Cookies & Similar Technologies.** We use cookies to help us collect, maintain and use information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to save your username and login password for future logins to the Site, to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with Clover Services and to monitor aggregate usage. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all of its functionality. We may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (individually or collectively "Pixel Tags") in combination with cookies in connection with our service to collect usage, demographic and geographical location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, which is typically a transparent graphic that is placed on a webpage and may be associated with cookies on your hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness of our Site's services.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

**Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.** We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose non-identifying information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.

**Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.** Clover cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including, but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Clover or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

**Business Transfers.** Clover may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.

### Changing or Deleting Your Information

You may review, update, or correct the Personal Information or Company Information in your Account Profile by logging into your Clover Account. After deleting your account, you may email us at [privacy@clover.com](mailto:privacy@clover.com) with a request that we delete your Personal Information or Company Information from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

### Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. When you or your customers enter sensitive information (such as password or credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. In some cases, we also encrypt or cryptographically hash sensitive information where it is stored on our systems.

We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

### International Transfer

Your information may be transferred to—and maintained on—computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Clover transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information, or your submission of such information to us or your consent to a Publisher to share your information with Clover represents your agreement to that transfer.

### Links to Other Sites, Other Services and 3rd party Apps

Clover may contain links to other websites, online services and to 3rd party applications or “Apps” that integrate with the Clover Service. If you click on a link to another site, service or configure a 3rd party app from within the Clover App Store, you will be visiting a 3rd party site or likewise, integrating 3rd party services or applications into your Clover Service. The fact that we link to a website, online service or application is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. While we do review 3rd party applications for safety and usefulness before releasing into the Clover App Store, we do not exercise control over third party websites, online services or Apps. These other websites, online services or Apps may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit Personal Information or Company Information from you. Other sites, services and applications follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites, online services and applications you visit or use.

### Phishing

Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Clover. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your Clover account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website.

### Our Policy Toward Children

We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [privacy@clover.com](mailto:privacy@clover.com). If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.

### Changes to Our Privacy Policy

Clover reserves the right to change its Privacy Policy from time to time at our sole discretion. If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
