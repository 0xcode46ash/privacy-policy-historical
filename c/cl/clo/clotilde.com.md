All information, including transactions, customer accounts, and all correspondence, are handled with discretion and care. The policies below apply to all of the Web sites we own and operate.

**Browsing and the use of cookies**  
Dynamic Resource Group and [its Web sites](https://web.archive.org/web/20040622080223id_/http%3A//www.drgnetwork.com/pages/privacy_subsidiaries.html) capture certain anonymous information from our visitors. This includes the Internet provider's name (e.g. AOL), paths taken through a given site and "click stream" activity such as when you click on a banner advertisement. No information that could identify you as an individual is collected in this manner.

Cookies are used as part of our statistical reporting and have no personal information tied to them. We use this technology to help ensure that you will not be exposed to a lot of offers and products that are of no interest to you.Â We do not capture e-mail addresses or personal information through our use of cookies.

Information that is collected through the use of cookies and standard Web server log files may be used to enhance the content of our sites to provide you with a better experience in the future, to respond to customer inquiries and suggestions or to provide special offers to you.

**Protecting your personal information**  
Dynamic Resource Group values your privacy and the security of your information. We utilize firewalls, secure access storage facilities and other means to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.

Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure online commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.

**E-mail from Dynamic Resource Group  
**If you have provided your e-mail address to [subsidiaries](https://web.archive.org/web/20040622080223id_/http%3A//www.drgnetwork.com/pages/privacy_companies.html) owned and operated by Dynamic Resource Group, from time to time you will receive e-mails from us that we feel would be of interest to you. With every commercial e-mail, we will provide you with a link to opt-out from receiving future commercial e-mail advertising products sold by [subsidiaries](https://web.archive.org/web/20040622080223id_/http%3A//www.drgnetwork.com/pages/privacy_companies.html) of Dynamic Resource Group.

We will continue to send you transactional related e-mail unless you specifically request not to receive such e-mail. Transactional e-mail may include product recall information, or safety or security information, subscription information, membership details, account status, order confirmations, shipping confirmations, invoices and customer service related e-mail.

**E-mail handling procedures**  
We will provide an opt-out link on all of our commercial e-mail announcements. Opt-out requests are usually handled as soon as the request is made. However, it may take up to 10 days to process an opt-out request.

Dynamic Resource Group and its family of companies will not share your e-mail address with other companies. However, we want to ensure those who have opted out no longer receive commercial e-mail from us. Therefore, we will share our opt-out e-mail addresses with our trusted third-party advertising partners for the sole purpose of removing opt-out addresses from our commercial e-mail announcements.

**Regular mail from Dynamic Resource Group**  
Once you enter your name, address and other information, (such as signing up for a trial subscription, submitting an order, etc.) you may receive correspondence and promotional offers from Dynamic Resource Group via regular postal mail. You always have the opportunity to have your name removed from our promotion list. Simply contact us and we'll promptly do so.

**Mail from other companies**  
From time to time we may make the regular postal mailing list of Dynamic Resource Group customer names available to organizations whose products or services we think might be of interest to you. You may always ask to be removed from this promotion mailing list.

**Policy for individuals 17 years old and under**
