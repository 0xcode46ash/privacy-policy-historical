We use "cookies," which are small text files placed on your computer, to help us to better understand your preferences so that we can customize our content to meet your needs. Certain applications (e.g. use of "cookies"), do not lend themselves to an opt out process, in which case your use of our websites constitutes your permission to supply our service providers with information such as your IP address necessary to provide these applications.

If you are a supplier who wants to check the status of an invoice, we will ask you for your Vendor Code, Purchase Order Number and Invoice Number.

However, it is important to note that e-mail is not considered a secure medium and the transmission, receipt or security of information which you send via email cannot be guaranteed. Our email communications to you is available to anyone with access to your email account.

Important security measures you can take are to never tell anyone your password, and to always log out of your User ID and close your browser window when you have finished working to ensure that no one else can access your information. This is especially important if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a library or other public place. The Company will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or unsolicited email. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. Although we use the best available technology (i.e., encryption, firewalls, access control software, etc.) to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or any information you give us through our online products or services. As such, you provide information at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we employ rigorous security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information on our systems. 

Some states and public utility commissions which regulate the Company's utility businesses have specific requirements regarding the disclosure and protection of certain customer and personal information, including MA (201 CMR 17.00: M.G.L. c. 93H) and CT (C.G.S. Ch. 743dd Section 42-470- 42-473). See:
