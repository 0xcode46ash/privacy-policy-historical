# ClairMail Privacy Policy

We recognize that when you visit our Web site and provide us with personal information, you trust that we will act responsibly and keep your information secure and confidential.

On the ClairMail website, we collect the following information: cookies (if you accept them), log files, and personal information (when volunteered by you). 

### Personal Information

You can visit our website without providing us with any personal information. However, ClairMail does collect information from our visitors at different points on our website, in which you volunteer your personal information in response to a registration or request form. We will need certain details - such as your name, email address, postal address, or phone number in order to respond to your inquiries and provide you with more information on those products or services. We may use this information to contact you about products or services on our site for which you have expressed interest.

### Use of User Information

ClairMail uses email addresses and other personal information submitted through our website to reply to your requests for information about our products, services and other general information. We do not disclose information about individual visits to our website or other personal information that you may give us to any third parties without your permission.

### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer that contains information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of the time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

By setting a persistent cookie on our site, users will not have to login more than once to certain parts of our website, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user may have to complete a login form more than once.

### Log Files

Like most standard website servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

### Choice/Opt-out

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking on the Member Console link at the bottom of the email or email us at [info@clairmail.com](mailto:info@clairmail.com) with UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line.

### Links

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, ClairMail, Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

### Legal Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

At ClairMail, we realize that you exercise caution when submitting personal information about yourself via the Internet. That's why we are committed to maintaining your privacy and protecting the information that you share with us.
