# Classifieds.co.uk - Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy for Classifieds.co.uk**

We are extremely concerned to protect your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all users of our site are quite rightly concerned to know that their data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will not fall into the hands of a third party. Our policy is both specific and strict. If you think our policy falls short of your expectations or that we are failing to abide by our policy, do please tell us. 

We are constantly vigilant for credit card or other fraud. We report all charge backs to a credit reference agency. If you have any reason to seek the return of money paid, please contact us rather than your credit card issuer. 

Information may be unlawfully available to hackers and snoopers. We take no responsibility for this. The risk is no different from a similar risk in a bricks and mortar establishment. Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any personally identifiable information collected at this site. If this policy should change in the future (most unlikely), then we shall provide notification in advance, and the opportunity for all users to indicate whether or not they would prefer that we do not provide the information to third parties as proposed. 

Here is a list of the information we collect, and why it is necessary to collect it: 

* 1 Basic identification and contact information, such as your name and contact details. 

This information is used:

1.1 to provide you with the services which you request;   
1.2 to maintain our accounts;   
1.3 for billing;   
1.4 to enable us to answer your enquiries;   
1.5 for verifying your identity for security purposes;   
1.6 for marketing our services and products;   
1.7 to help make our web site as useful to you as possible;   
1.8 information which does not identify any individual may be used in a general way by us or third parties, to provide class information, for example relating to demographics or usage of a particular page or service. 

* 2 Your domain name, IP address and email address are recognised by our servers and the pages that you visit are recorded. This information is used: 

2.1 in a collective way not referable to any particular individual, for the purpose of quality control and improvement of our site;   
2.2 to send you news about the services to which you have signed up;   
2.3 to tell you about other of our services. 

* 3 Financial information, including credit card details

This information is used to obtain payment for services you have ordered from us. This information is never actually received by us. The page where this information is given by you is controlled by our contract merchant service provider. Such information is automatically encrypted, and later decrypted for use. It never touches our system. 

* 4 Your Classifieds.co.uk personal profile 

When you post an advert on our site, you can choose whether or not to include any contact information within the content of the advert. You do not have to do this and can make use of the "Contact Advertiser" feature provided by us instead which does not disclose your email address to other users. 

We ask you for your location and postcode. Your postcode is not displayed within the advert and is used purely for the purposes of our search software which allows users to locate items or services that are available within a particular range of a their own postcode. 

We may publish your Location in the advert to allow our users to see broadly where abouts you are located. We do not publish specific postal addresses unless you choose to include them within the main content of your advert. 

We may choose to market to you details of other products or services available from us or third parties either via email, telephone, text message or post. You are not obliged to enter a telephone number of mobile number in your profile. 

Information, which does not identify any individual may be used in a general way by us or third parties, to provide class information, for example relating to demographics or usage of a particular page or service. Some of this information is classified as sensitive information by the UK Data Protection Act 1998. We make the assumption that in giving this information to us, you consent to our holding it for the duration of your membership. 

You can edit or delete your personal profile at anytime via our website. 

* 5 Information volunteered by you 

for a particular purpose, for example a personal profile, survey, job application form, or contest. This information will be used exclusively for the purpose for which you have provided it. Information is disclosed to third parties only where the third party concerned qualifies in whatever way the web site page requires. We will make absolutely clear on the face of the page, any intention to publicise the name of a winner. 

* 6 Affiliate information 

This is information given to us in the course of your business and ours as you have applied to join our affiliate scheme. Such information is retained for business use only. We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of the terms of our relationship. This information is used:
