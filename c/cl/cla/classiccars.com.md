# Privacy Policy

**Our Commitment to Your Privacy**  
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. We believe that a full disclosure of our privacy policy is essential to our success and to your ongoing patronage. To make this Privacy Policy easy to find, we make it available on our home page and at every point where personally identifiable information may be voluntarily supplied or requested. 

This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected or submitted on _ClassicCars.com_ (the "Site"). 

**Information Collection and Use**  
Collector Car Network, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on the Site. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Network. 

In order to use certain features of the Site, such as posting a vehicle listing or subscribing to a newsletter, you must first complete a registration form and create a user account and password. During registration you provide us with your contact information (such as your name and email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on the Site in which you have expressed interest. 

We may give you the option to provide basic demographic information (such as income, gender, and education) to us; we strongly encourage you to submit this information so we can provide our customers with a better, more useful experience on the Site. Providing any such demographic information is entirely optional and is identified as such at the time of data collection. 

**Orders**  
If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order forms. You must provide contact information (such as name, email address, billing address, and shipping address) and financial information (such as a credit card number and expiration date). 

We use this information for billing purposes and to process your orders. We also use this information to send you confirmations and updates of your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. 

**Surveys or Contests**  
From time to time we may offer you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on the Site. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address) and demographic information (such as your age and ZIP code). 

We use this information to gather feedback about Site features, notify contest winners and award prizes, and/or to send participants an email newsletter. 

We may use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; any such company will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice. 

**"Send to a Friend"**  
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about the Site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral program. 

Your friend may contact us using our "Contact Us" form to request that we remove this information from our database. 

**Communications from Us**  
We will occasionally send you information on new Site features, services, special deals, and promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see "Choice and Opt-Out" below for more information. 

If you wish to subscribe to our email newsletters, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe with each newsletter we send you. 

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt out of these communications because they are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. 

Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email and/or telephone, in accordance with your wishes. 

**User Profile**  
We store information that we collect through cookies, server log files, tracking images, and third party sources to create a "profile" of your preferences. We tie your personally identifiable information, including your purchase history, to information in the profile, in order to provide you with tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the Network for you. 

**Supplementation of Information**  
In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submitted to us with information from third-party sources. Examples of such sources include the following: 

_Payment Verification_  
For your protection as well as ours, we use a third-party payment processing service to verify your billing address when we process your orders. We may also use a third-party verification service in order to safeguard against fraudulent credit card use. 

_Enhancement of Profile Information_  
We may purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers in which we think you would be interested. To enrich user profiles of individual customers, we tie this information to the personally identifiable information they have provided to us. 

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
We share aggregated demographic information about our visitors with our partners, affiliates, and advertisers. This information does not identify individual users; rather, it provides our partners, affiliates, and advertisers with a description of our user base as a whole. Partners may include third parties with whom we have or may have a business relationship, such as sponsors. 

We share personally identifiable information with select third parties: 

_Agents_  
We use a shipping company to fulfill orders for goods, and we use online payment processing companies to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. 

_Fulfillment Providers_  
We use third parties to fulfill orders for certain goods and services. These companies may retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information subject to their own privacy policies. 

_Service Providers_  
We use a third party to provide email newsletter mailings. When you sign up for a newsletter, we will share your email address and certain elements of your Profile as necessary for the third party to provide that service. 

**Legal Disclaimer**  
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us. 

**Choice and Opt-Out**  
We provide you with the opportunity to "opt out" of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. For example, if you register for an account with us but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our registration form. 

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication. 

You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent or service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. 

**Log Files**  
As is typical of professionally managed websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data for each user of the Site. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

Generally, we do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are, however, tied to personally identifiable information in conjunction with orders in order to help prevent online payment fraud. 

We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies and tracking images to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors in the aggregate. We use this information to supplement the information we gather from analyzing our log files. 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We do not store any personally identifiable information in cookies, but we may link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information when required for technical reasons, such as in keeping track of your account information or shopping cart. 

We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s documentation. More information about cookies can be found by following this link: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWW_cookie>

We set a persistent cookie to help keep track of visits our users make to the Site. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on the Site. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use many areas of the site will be limited. 

This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Collector Car Network, Inc. only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or other third parties. Some of our business partners (for example, advertisers) use cookies on the Site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. Please see "Third Party Advertisers" for more information. 

**Tracking Graphics**  
We and/or our third-party partners employ a software technology called tracking graphics (a.k.a. "Web beacons" or "Web bugs") that help us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective. Tracking graphics are tiny, transparent images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, tracking graphics are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. As with cookies, we may tie the information gathered by tracking graphics to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 

We use tracking graphics in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt out of these emails, you may do so by following the instructions included in every such communication. 

**Third-Party Advertisers**  
Some of the ads appearing the Network are delivered to users by one or more advertising partners. We may share aggregate website usage information about users with reputable third parties for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on the Site. Third-Party advertisers may use cookies and/or tracking graphics on the Site, allowing them to recognize a user when a user visits the Site. The information that such companies collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable. 

**Links to Other Websites**  
This privacy Policy applies only to information collected by ClassicCars.com, Inc. The Site contains links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage you to be aware of when you leave the Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. 

**Co-Branded Sites**  
Portions of the Site may include content or information provided by reputable third parties and integrated into the Site by means of frames. Frames divide your Internet browser's screen into separate areas for purposes of making navigation or use of the Site easier. If you submit any information on such pages, your information is made available to that third party for purposes of providing you with the information or service you request. In such instances, it may not be obvious whether we or the third party are collecting your information. We will identify any pages of the Site that involve the framing of third-party websites. Generally, no personally identifiable information is shared on such pages. You may choose to not provide any information to the third party by navigating away from such areas of the Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information collected on those sites. 

**Bulletin Boards/Chat Rooms**  
If you use a bulletin board or chat room on the Site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. 

**Access to Personally Identifiable Information**  
If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our services, you may correct, update, or deactivate it by making the change on our member account pages. 

**Security**  
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on the Site, we encrypt that information using secure sockets layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link: [ttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer)

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on the Site, you may ask via our "Contact Us" page. 

**Business Transitions**  
In the event Collector Car Network, Inc. goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. 

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. 

**Contact Us**  
If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us using our "Contact Us" page and mention our privacy policy in your inquiry.
