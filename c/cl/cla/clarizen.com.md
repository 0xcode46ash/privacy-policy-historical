# Online Project Management Software Privacy Policy | Clarizen

## Privacy Policy

Effective date: 3/6/2016

#### This privacy policy has been created to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally identifiable information’ (PII) is being used by Clarizen’s services, which include its site at clarizen.com as well as its applications for mobile devices and social networks (collectively, the “Site” or “Services”). PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.

Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information that is voluntarily submitted or collected automatically when accessing the Services.

This Privacy Policy was last updated on the “Effective date” noted above. Clarizen reserves the right to change, modify or amend this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our privacy practices. You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically and to check the “Effective date” at the top of this Privacy Policy for the most recent version, to inform yourself about how your PII is collected, used and shared when you use the Services.

If you do not agree with these terms, please do not access or use the Services.

### What personal information do we collect?

In order to enable visitors of our Services to see certain pages, when specifically requested by such visitors, we may require the user to provide contact information, (including but not limited to name and e-mail address). The information collected shall be used for the purposes providing you with email support and in order to allow Clarizen to contact you, from time to time, via email communication, with news and updates about services, products and offerings (such as: a newsletter, new releases, new features, special offers etc.).

If you wish, at any time, to remove your email address from any of the above mentioned email mailing lists and stop receiving future email communications from us, other than the emails directly related to the Service functionality, you may unsubscribe by sending an email to: info@clarizen.com. For your convenience, email communication from us contains instructions regarding how to unsubscribe from our e-mail mailing lists.

Contact information is information such as your name or mailing address that can be used to uniquely identify you. In order to use certain Services and/or receive newsletters or commercial offers, you must provide contact information.

### When do we collect information?

We collect information from you when you register on our site, access our services, subscribe to a newsletter, fill out a form, or enter information on our site.

### How do we use your information?

We may use the information we collect from you when you register, sign up for newsletters, respond to surveys or marketing communications, or use certain other site features, in the following ways:

  * To personalize user’s experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested or have directly requested from us.
  * To improve our Services in order to better serve you.
  * To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests.
  * To administer surveys or other site features.
  * To quickly process your transactions.
  * To send periodic emails regarding your products and services.



### How do we protect visitor information?

Clarizen employs a dedicated security team that utilizes industry best practices and best of breed technology to manage security of our infrastructure and your data.

All your contact information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, is held in strict confidence. This information is collected for the primarily purposes of enabling you to receive the Services requested by you.

### Security scanning

Your personal information is encrypted and stored behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted “in transit,” and “at rest.”

We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.

Although we take every possible measure to provide secure Services we cannot fully control and therefore cannot be liable for service interruptions, intrusions, errors, loss of data, or any other interference with the use of the Services as a result of security related incidents.

### Do we use cookies?

Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (with your permission) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and remember certain information. Cookies are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current Site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about Site traffic and Site interaction so that we can better tailor your site experience while improving functionality in the future.

### We use cookies to:

Understand and save user’s preferences for future visits.  
Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third party services that track this information on our behalf.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.

If you disable cookies, you will still be able to access our site, but some features may be disabled and some of our services may not function properly.  
Third party disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information (PII) unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our Services, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to protect ourselves from liability, or to comply with law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety. We may also disclose your personal information to the extent necessary in connection with a merger, acquisition, liquidation or bankruptcy of the company.

However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.  
Third party links

Links to third party websites are provided as a convenience to you. Such linked sites are outside of our control and responsibility and are not covered by this policy. If you use any such linked sites, you should consult the privacy policies posted on those websites.  
Do-Not-Track signals

Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) mechanisms, we currently do not respond to web browser DNT signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We may revisit our policy on responding to these signals, in which case we will post a revised privacy policy on this site.  
California Online Privacy Protection Act

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites or mobile applications collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.

According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:

Users can visit our site anonymously, but this will limit our ability to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested, or for which you have paid and subscribed to.

Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.

Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’, and can be easily be found on the page specified above.

Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:

On our Privacy Policy page

Users are able to change their personal information:

  * By emailing us
  * By calling us
  * By contacting their account representatives



### Fair Information Practices

The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:

We will notify the users via email, or preferred method of communication.  
We will notify the users via in-site notification.

### Limitation of liability

Under no circumstances, including but not limited to negligence, shall we be liable for any special or consequential damages that results from the use of, or the inability to use, the website and the materials in it.

Without derogating the aforementioned, in no event shall our total liability exceed the amount paid by you, if any, for accessing the site.

### Notice to California residents re: direct marketing

Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information regarding disclosure within the immediately preceding calendar year of that California resident’s personal information to third parties (and in some cases affiliates) for their direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as Clarizen does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers with a choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties and affiliates for those third parties’ and affiliates’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. At this time, we do not share personally identifiable information with third parties or affiliates for those third parties’ or affiliates’ direct marketing purposes. If we do so in the future, Clarizen will provide you with a choice prior to sharing your personally identifiable information with third parties and affiliates for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time Clarizen offers that choice, we will not share your information with that identified third party or affiliate for its direct marketing purposes.

If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request to the following email address: [info@clarizen.com](mailto:info@clarizen.com) or write to us at the following mailing address. You must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field of your e-mail or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address. You must include your name, street address, city, state and zip code. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year.
