# CLASSICAL MUSIC ARCHIVES Privacy Policy

**We are committed to protecting your privacy. You can use most of our site without giving us any private information. However we do need information when you want to listen/download our files or when you wish to subscribe or purchase a registration to our software.

There are four kinds of Personal Information: 

  1. Credit Card Information - never shared
    * Name 
    * Billing Address 
    * Credit Card Details (number, expiration) 
    * Email address 
  
This information is only required if you subscribe to the Classical Archives or register one of our software programs.   
This information is NOT collected by us - but only by our credit card processors: iBill and PayPal - through a secure server.   
_Your credit card details are NOT given to us BY IBILL OR PAYPAL. And no personal information is shared with any other third party by iBill or PayPal._ (See [iBill's Privacy Policy](http://www.ibill.com/About/legal.cfm) and [PayPal's Privacy Policy](http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/privacy-outside).) 
  2. Personal Data - never shared unless expressly asked by you
    * Name 
    * Email address 
    * IP Address 
  
This information is collected during the subscription's last step.   
It is required to manage your subscription. It is NOT shared with any third party unless you expressly ask us to share it.   
We do not use your email address for spamming and we communicate with you by email only when asked by you or required by the discharge of our obligations to you.   
In some special circumstances, and only if you have given us permission to do so, we or our affiliates may communicate with you by email. 
  3. Site Recognition Code "Cookie" - never shared
    * Name of cookie 
    * Cookie number 
    * Subscriber level 
  
When you accept cookies from our site, your browser places small text files (a "cookie") on your computer so that you don't need to manually log-in each time you come to our site and to keep track of your status as a subscriber and of the limits you are entitled to. These cookies do not contain any personal information and cannot be used to track your usage by any other site. 

If you elect not to accept cookies we cannot determine if you are logged-in. In addition, if you are behind a proxy server, our server cannot determine exactly how many files you listened to that day and may indicate that you have reached the daily limit sooner than if you're allowing cookies. This is due to the fact that, without a cookie, the server can only rely on an IP address which is also shared by many other users behind the same proxy. 

  4. Anonymous Data - which may be shared in aggregate form only
    * City, State 
    * Age range (voluntary) 
    * Education (voluntary) 
    * If you play an instrument (voluntary) 
    * Which new cultural area you wish to see on our site (voluntary) 
  
This information is collected when you subscribe and is added to our demographics database to help us in our mission to provide our users with a better experience on our site. It is not shared with any third party as individual records (attached to your name or other personal information.) It may however be aggregated to provide a sense of the general demographics of our users to our partners and affiliates. When such data is aggregated you remain totally anonymous. Note that most of this information is voluntary: we do not force you to provide this information: you may elect not to provide this information to us. 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain [there.](http://www.prs.net/secure/maintenance.html) You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error [there.](http://www.prs.net/email_feedback.html) To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
