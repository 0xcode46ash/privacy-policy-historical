# CLASSICAL MUSIC ARCHIVES Privacy Policy

**We are committed to protecting your privacy and security. You can use most of our site without giving us any private information. However we do need information when you want to listen/download our files or when you wish to subscribe or purchase a registration to our software.

There are four kinds of Personal Information: 

**

  1. Credit Card Information - never shared   
This information is only required if you subscribe to the Classical Archives or register one of our software programs.   
This information is collected for our credit card processor VeriSign - through secure servers (which means that all communication to and from these servers are encrypted.)   
_Your credit card details are kept securely by VeriSign and NOT even kept by us. No personal information is shared with any other third party by us or VeriSign._ (See [VeriSign's Privacy Policy](http://www.verisign.com/truste/index.html).) 
  2. Personal Data - never shared unless expressly requested by you
    * Name 
    * Email address 
    * IP Address 
  
This information is collected during the subscription's last step.   
It is required to manage your subscription. It is NOT shared with any third party unless you expressly ask us to share it.   
We do not use your email address for spamming and we communicate with you by email only when asked by you or required by the discharge of our obligations to you.   
In some special circumstances, and only if you have given us permission to do so, our affiliates may communicate with you by email. (Note that - to date - we've never shared an email address or other data with any affiliate.) 
  3. Site Recognition Code "Cookie" - never shared
    * Name of cookie 
    * Cookie number 
    * Subscriber level 
  
When you accept cookies from our site, your browser places small text files (a "cookie") on your computer so that you don't need to manually login each time you come to our site and to keep track of your status as a subscriber and of the limits you are entitled to. These cookies do not contain any personal information and cannot be used to track your usage by any other site. 

If you elect not to accept cookies we cannot determine if you are logged-in. In addition, if you are behind a proxy server, our server cannot determine exactly how many files you listened to that day and may indicate that you have reached the daily limit sooner than if you're allowing cookies. This is due to the fact that, without a cookie, the server can only rely on an IP address which is also shared by many other users behind the same proxy. 

  4. Anonymous Data - which may be shared in aggregate form only
    * City, State 
    * Age range (voluntary) 
    * Education (voluntary) 
    * If you play an instrument (voluntary) 
    * Which new cultural area you wish to see on our site (voluntary) 
  
This information is collected when you subscribe and is added to our demographics database to help us in our mission to provide our users with a better experience on our site. It is not shared with any third party as individual records (attached to your name or other personal information.) It may however be aggregated to provide a sense of the general demographics of our users to our partners and affiliates. When such data is aggregated you remain totally anonymous. Note that most of this information is voluntary: we do not force you to provide this information: you may elect not to provide this information to us. 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain [there.](http://www.prs.net/secure/settings.html) You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error [there.](http://www.prs.net/email_feedback.html) To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. 


  
Anti-Spam

It is not the policy or the practice of our company, its affiliates, or personnel to send unsolicited email and in particular email containing advertising or other objectionable material. If you have received email which contains solicitations or objectionable content and which used one of our domain names in its return address â€” it is most certainly a forgery or they have placed a link to our website without our permission. 

Although there is little we and other legitimate companies can do to stop the appropriation of our name by fraudulent email web sites, we sincerely regret the distress this may cause you. 

When we learn of such activity we do make an effort to trace the source of fraudulent email and register a complaint with the source of the email and the Internet Service Provider (ISP) that hosts the connection. 

There are two special circumstances in which legitimate email does originate from our website: 

  1. Email may be sent by one individual to another with a link to the web site. The person receiving that email might incorrectly interpret the email as unsolicited mass email if they did not recognize the sender as a friend or acquaintance of theirs. If someone is inappropriately using this feature of our web site and repeatedly sending you email, let us know their email address and we will do our best to block the sender. 
  2. In order to communicate to our subscribers we occasionally send mail to inform them of their subscription status. Note that our subscribers indicate at subscription time that we may or may not contact them and we respect their wishes. This list is limited to our paid subscribers and is used only by our web site when permission has been given. The subscriber list is held in confidence and is not shared with any other web site, company, or organization. 



Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please call us at 1-650-330-8050 or [send us an email through our feedback form.](http://www.prs.net/email_feedback.html)
