**Use of Facebook Social Plugins**   
Our website uses Social Plugins ("Plugins") of the social network facebook.com which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). The Plugins are marked with a Facebook logo or the supplement “Facebook Social Plugin”. An overview of the Facebook Plugins and their design may be accessed [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/). 

If you open a page of our website that contains such a Plugin, your browser will establish a direct connection with the Facebook servers.

By integrating Plugins, Facebook will receive the information that a user has accessed the corresponding page of our web presence.

If Plugins are used, e.g. leaving a comment or clicking the “Share” button, the respective information is transferred from the user’s browser directly to Facebook and may be stored there. If a user does not have a Facebook account or is not logged into Facebook, there is still the possibility that Facebook may find out and store his/her IP address as well as browser-related information.
