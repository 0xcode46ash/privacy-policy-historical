# Privacy Policy | Claire's

This Privacy Policy was last updated and is effective as of May 13, 2014. 

This Claire's U.S. Privacy Policy applies only to this web site (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computer, mobile device, or otherwise), and other interactive features or protocols that link to this Privacy Policy (including, without limitation, mobile sites, widgets and downloads) and are owned or controlled by CBI Distributing Corp. ("Claire's," "we," "our," or "us") (collectively, the "Site").  This Privacy Policy only applies to information collected through the Site unless we specifically state otherwise.  In addition, if Claire's combines information collected at one of its retail stores with information collected through the Site, this Privacy Policy will govern the combined information. 

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Please also review the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/us/content/terms-of-use), which governs your use of the Site and any content you submit to the Site. 

## NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California residents who provide us with personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family, or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us, one time per calendar year, information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as Claire's does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-in or opt-out) regarding sharing Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. As stated below in this Privacy Policy, Claire's provides you choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time Claire's offers that choice, Claire's does not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes. 

If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please e-mail your request to customerservice@claires.com or write to us at the following mailing address:

Attn: Corporate Attorney 

You must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the subject field of your e-mail or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address. You must include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. We will respond to you at your mailing address or, at our option, your e-mail address. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.

## INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT THROUGH THE SITE

#### Information that You Provide

The Site may collect information, including "Personal Information" (which is information that can be used to specifically identify you personally, such as first and last name, e-mail address, telephone number, or home address), account information (password and other information collected to an account you create with us), demographic information (such as gender or age), information about your interests and preferences and other information about you.  We will also collect payment information if you choose to purchase products or services through the Site. If we combine demographic information or other non-Personal Information with Personal Information, then we will treat the combined information as Personal Information. Note that if you provide Claire's with information through another Claire's website, application or online service (such as Claires.com), we may combine that information with information we collect here.  The combined information will be subject to this privacy policy. 

There may also be times when you submit information about someone else, such as when you wish to send products, information or content from the Site. We (or our third-party service providers) use the information you provide about others (typically name and email address) to fulfill your request and not for any other purpose.

PLEASE NOTE: The Site is a general audience website. Where we offer features that collect personal information, we typically restrict use of such features to users who have identified themselves as age 13 or older. There may be occasions where we offer a specific feature (such as a sweepstakes) or webpage that does allow children younger than age 13 to participate, in which case that feature will post a Children’s Privacy Policy and will, if required by applicable law, provide notice and obtain consent of a parent or legal guardian. . 

#### Information We Collect Automatically When You Access and Use the Site

In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to the Site, we and our third-party service providers (including content and analytics providers and advertising companies) may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Site or one of our advertisements or other content elsewhere online ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include the browser you are using, the URL that referred you to our Site, all of the areas within our Site that you visit, and the time of day, among other information. Our systems may also automatically gather information about the search terms you use on our Site and the links you select from within our Site to other areas of the Web or elsewhere online. In addition, we may collect your IP address or other unique identifier for your computer, cell phone, or other device used to access the Site (collectively referred to as a "Device Identifier"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, your cell phone, or other device used to access the Site, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with you, as an individual and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal Information.

Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context.  Like many websites and online services, the Site currently does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).  

#### Cookies and Similar Technologies

The Site may include the following tracking technologies, and similar technologies, and which may be set and controlled by us or by our third-party service, advertising or content providers (including advertising services such as Google):

Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to visit the Site. A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plugin that may be built into or downloaded by you to your device. Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering your device and your preferences and tracking (and serving advertisements elsewhere online based on) your visits to our web pages. For more information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit this [site.](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html) If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your device, some features of the Site may not function properly. 

Web Beacons. Web beacons are small graphic images or other programming code (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs"). We may include web beacons in our web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. Web beacons may be used to collect certain Personal Information (for example, the e-mail address associated with an e-mail message).

Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links on which you click. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer, mobile device or other device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies on the Site that collect information for security and fraud detection purposes.

#### Information from Other Sources

We may receive information about you from our parent, subsidiary or affiliated companies.  We also may receive information from third parties. For example, if you are on another web site and you opt-in to receive information from our Site, the third-party web site may forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested.  We may supplement the information we collect about you online with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. If we combine Personal Information we receive from other sources with information we collect through the Site, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined Personal Information.

The Site may permit you to interact with a third-party site or service, such as enabling you to "like" us on another site or "share" content from the Site with other sites (a “Social Networking Service”). If you choose to "like" or "share" content or to otherwise post information from or via the Site to a Social Networking Service, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Site. Similarly, if you interact with us through a Social Networking Service, we may have access to information about you (for example, if you "like" or "follow" our page on a third-party site).  Please note that if you mention or comment upon Claire's or the Site in your post to a third-party platform, the third-party platform may allow us to publish your post on the Site.

You may also choose to use a social media tool offered by a third party, but available on the Site (such as posting a review or logging into the Site with your username and password for another site, such as the Facebook Connect feature). Use of such a feature may allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. Information about you, including your name and profile photo, may be shown to other users of the Site if you are logged in through the Site or through a third-party web site or service or if you have previously posted content to the Site while logged in. When you choose to use a social media tool available through the Site, you may be opting to link your activity on our Site with that third-party web site or service, which may then collect information about your visits to our Site and may publish that activity as you request to your profile or similar feature with that third party.  For example, when you link your Facebook account to the Site using Facebook Connect, your likes, product reviews, and Wish List additions will be shared on your Facebook account unless you disable that sharing. 

In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third-party web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third-party web site or interactive service. 

The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third-party web site and service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected.

#### User Content and Community Forums

The Site may offer message boards, blogs, chat rooms, product reviews, and other public areas (collectively, "Community Forums") that give you the opportunity to share your opinions on products, engage in social networking, interact with others, or submit photographs, writings, music, video, audio recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including Personal Information (collectively, "User Content").

Note that anything you post to a Community Forum is public. Others will have access to your User Content and may use it or share it with third parties. If you choose to voluntarily disclose User Content publicly, the protections of this Privacy Policy will not cover your disclosure of that information or content. Think carefully before you post and use caution before disclosing any Personal Information. 

If you choose to submit User Content, your User Content may be published online or offline in any medium or format (currently existing or hereafter developed). Subject to applicable law, we may also publish your name, voice, likeness and other Personal Information with your User Content, and may use the User Content, or any portion of the User Content, for advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities. For full terms and conditions regarding User Content you submit, please review our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/us/content/terms-of-use).

#### Third Parties Providing Services on our Behalf 

We may use third-party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of the Site, such as hosting or operating the Site, sending e-mail and/or other communications, data analysis, marketing assistance, customer service, and performing other administrative services.

Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.

By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the terms, conditions or official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including (except where prohibited by law) allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness, and/or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion or as required by law, such as in connection with winner selection or prize fulfillment and as otherwise permitted under the Promotion's official rules. 

## THIRD PARTY AD NETWORKS, ANALYTICS PROVIDERS, AND SIMILAR THIRD PARTIES

We work with network advertisers, ad agencies, third-party traffic measurement services, and other vendors (which may include Google) to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Site, to serve our advertisements elsewhere online, including advertisements based upon your prior visits to the Site, and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Site and the effectiveness of our advertisements. 

These service providers may collect certain information, including personal information, over time about you and your visits to the Site or other web sites. These third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies on your computer or mobile device, including cookies and web beacons,[Link to page anchors at the “Cookies” and “Web Beacons” sections above] and may otherwise collect or have access to your Device Identifier and information about your visits to and activity on the Site as well as other web sites or online services. 

Cookies and web beacons, including those set by third-party network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may share Device Identifier and Usage Information about visitors with third-party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors for similar purposes. 

We use a variety of service providers to perform advertising services. Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You may want to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members. You may also want to visit or http://www.aboutads.info/choices/, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and offers an “opt-out” by participating companies in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program. Please note opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while online.

## LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SITE CONTENT ON THIRD-PARTY SITES

The Site may include links to other web sites that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. In addition, Site widgets or other Site content may be included on web pages and web sites that are not associated with us and over which we have no control. These third parties may collect their own Usage Information or solicit and collect Personal Information. Claire's is not responsible for the practices or content of any third party.
