# Class Creator Privacy Policy

Effective Date: November 1, 2007

The following Privacy Policy governs the online data collection practices of Class Creator. Specifically, it describes the types of information that we collect about you while you are using the Class Creator web site, and the methods in which we use this information. 

As the web is a continually evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some time in the future. If we do we make changes we will update the "Effective Date" above to reflect the date of the changes. Your continued usage of the Class Creator system after we post any such changes will be considered as acceptance and agreement to the updated Privacy Policy terms.

**What Information is Collected About Visitors?**

The data that we collect about you while you are using the site falls into two basic categories:

1\. _Information You Provide to Us._

We may collect and store data that you voluntarily supply while using the Class Creator system. Some examples of this type of information include demographic information that you electronically submit when you sign up, information (such as your name or email address), information that you post on message boards on the site, and information contained in emails or questions that you submit to the Site. Should you decline to provide us with certain information while using the site it is possible you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Class Creator system. 

2\. _Information Automatically Collected._

We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the Class Creator system. For example, we use a standard feature of browser software called "cookies." Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Class Creator system, cookies help us track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter information on some areas of the site, such as login and password information to access the system. Another example of information we might automatically collect as you use the Class Creator system is information about your computer’s connection to the Internet. This information allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the site. 

**How is this Information Used?**

Class Creator respects your right to privacy. Class Creator collects information only for the purpose of creating your class web site and answering your questions. We may also use the information we collect from you while you are using the Class Creator system for other internal purposes, including using the information to customize features that appear on class web sites. We will not use personal information that we collect online from you while you are using the Class Creator system, nor will we use any information provided by classmates, to mail or email promotional offers (AKA spam). Your personal information and the personal information entered by your classmates will never be shared with other companies or organizations electronically or otherwise — period.

Please also keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by third parties online – for example on message boards, In Memory forums, through email or web logs, etc. – that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. Class Creator cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third party use of such information. 

Be aware that although we have not done so to date, we may release information about site visitors when release is appropriate to comply with an order of the law, or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of the Class Creator system. 

Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. Although not in our plans, in the unlikely event that we sell some or all of our assets, or our site is acquired by another company, information about our visitors may be among the transferred assets. 

**How To Make Changes to Your Information**

Administrators and classmates alike can log into the system and update your personal information at any time.
