Privacy Policy  


At Clark, we understand that issues surrounding personal privacy and the Internet are a major concern. We are committed to protecting the rights of all our visitors and want to share with you how we gather information to improve our pages. 

**Collection of On-line Information For Web Statistics**

We want to assure you as you explore our site that we do not collect any sensitive data that you would not want us to know without consent. We only acquire personal information you submit through e-mail or written correspondence. 

The information we track includes the number of visitors we receive to certain pages, the country from where the user is connecting, the browser being used, keywords from search engines and links from on-line directories used to find us. 

The information we do record helps us analyze the traffic to various sections of our site and aids us in site development. Our goal is to use this data to continue to make the site easy to navigate with content that meets the needs of our visitors.

**Regarding E-mail**

We only publish e-mail addresses of Clark alumni and students who tell us that they wish to post this information. For those who do provide us with their address for publication on the Web, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information about Clark or upcoming campus events.

We reserve the right to publish e-mail addresses of Clark faculty, administration, and staff at our discretion to better serve the academic community, parents, and prospective students.

Our system administrators respect the privacy of the users of on-campus systems under their control. They will not examine, nor allow others to examine the files or e-mail of users without permission except in situations where it is necessary for system administrators to ensure or restore the proper functioning of the system. In the event that it is not possible to obtain permission, the user and the Information Technology Advisory Committee will be notified promptly. However, access may be necessary in situations that call for the investigation of a complaint, when the Dean of Students, Provost, or Human Resources Manager is notified--or when compelled to do so by law. For additional details on this policy please refer to the [OIS Computer Policy page ](http://www.clarku.edu/offices/ois/computerpolicy.html). 

**Secure Transmissions**

Using an easy point and click interface, we've developed some sections of the site where you can enter your credit card number or bank information and submit it to us. 

Clark does not collect or assemble personal information for sale. The information is transmitted using the latest encryption technology with today's browsers and housed by a third-party affiliate. We strongly feel that your information should be kept on a server that specializes in 24-hour security and do everything we can to ensure we protect our visitors. Access is only given to those qualified professionals who are assigned the job of meeting your requests.
