# Privacy policy

This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for Edukey Education Ltd.

## Information Collection and Use

We will not sell, share, or rent information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Edukey Education Ltd collects information from our users at several different points on our system. The security of pupil data is of utmost importance and we use industry standards to ensure pupil data is secure. Pupil data will never be disclosed, published or shared with third parties.

## System Registration

In order to use some features of this system, users must first complete the registration form. During registration, users are required to give their contact information (name and e-mail address). This information is used to contact users about the topics on our site for which they have expressed interest and to enable users to retrieve lost passwords.

## Cookies

Edukey Education Ltd uses cookies to remember if users have logged in while on our site. This allows system users to avoid logging in more than once, thereby saving time. Users have the option of disabling or not accepting cookies by changing the preferences on their browsers*. If users opt to disable cookies, they will still be able to use our System. However, they will not be able to use some functionality or post to the message boards. No personally identifiable information (e-mail address, name, etc.) is collected with the cookies that we set. Accepting cookies while on the Edukey Education Ltd site will not put the user at risk for marketing to other sites.

*Different browsers have different cookie settings. With Netscape, you can ask the browser to allow, warn you, or completely disable cookies. Internet Explorer has an additional feature where you can specify different settings for different security zones. You can choose to allow cookies for you in your “trusted sites” (like Edukey Education Ltd), to warn you before you create them in your local Intranet zone, and to give you an option to never allow them in a “restricted zone.” See the “Help” section of your particular browser for more information on working with cookies.

## Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our home page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
