# Classcraft – translation missing: en_US.titles.privacy_policy

Classcraft has developed this Privacy Policy to let users know in general terms about Classcraft’s personal information management practices, including what personal information is collected and how it is processed and used. If users have any questions about our Privacy Policy, they may contact Classcraft at [wecare@classcraft.com](mailto:wecare@classcraft.com).

As Classcraft is designed to be played in groups, much of the information collected about the teachers and students is intended to be shared. Classcraft stores the following information that the teacher and students may choose to share with their class, colleagues, or school administration:

  * Student or teacher’s name;
  * Student or teacher’s email address;
  * Student or teacher’s game activities;
  * School and class information;
  * Postings in forums;
  * Homework assignments; and
  * Messages.



It is understood that the teacher is both the Gamemaster and the teacher and that all game-related or class-related information or communications are not private within the classroom and school environment (“School Environment”). The sharing of the above information is therefore also subject to the privacy policies of the relevant educational institutions. If users have any questions about the sharing of this information, Classcraft would recommend that users contact the relevant educational institutions.

Classcraft has taken all precautions to make sure that this data will not be shared outside the School Environment except as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

If users provide Classcraft with information about another person, such users are responsible for obtaining that person’s consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that person’s personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and specifically for the purpose for which such users have provided it to us.

Classcraft uses state-of-the-art industry standard methods to protect its customers’ data against unauthorized use or access, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction, or loss. It should however be noted that 100% guaranty cannot be made due to constant advances in virus and hacking technology. Classcraft can therefore not be held responsible for data loss or alteration.

Classcraft websites may contain links to other websites. Classcraft tries to only link to websites that share Classcraft’s high standards of decency, fairness, and integrity. Classcraft tries to make sure that these links are safe for everyone, but the privacy and data collection practices on any linked websites are entirely separate from Classcraft and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Other websites, which may contain material not suitable for children, may also link to Classcraft websites without Classcraft’s knowledge or consent. Classcraft does not necessarily endorse any outside websites, and Classcraft has no responsibility for the content, policies, or actions of these websites.

At least two weeks before the date that changes to the Privacy Policy are to take effect, Classcraft will send users an updated version thereof via email. Classcraft’s updated Privacy Policy will also be posted on Classcraft’s website. Classcraft asks users to review the updated Privacy Policy as soon as possible after the amendments have been made. If users do not accept the updated Privacy Policy, users can cancel their subscriptions in accordance with the Teacher License Agreement and/or Student License Agreement.
