# Clarks Online - Clarks Privacy Policy - How We Use Your Data

  


## How we use your information

Clarks never make your personal details available to any other company for marketing purposes. Clarks (and our representatives) may hold your personal details in order to process your order and maintain your account for research purposes. If you order with us we store and send you the details of your order as well as our general terms via email. You can find the terms [here](https://web.archive.org/TermsandConditions) at all times. The details about your recent orders can be found in your My Account page once you have logged in.

  


## Use and storage of data

If you have registered with us, or ordered items from us, we will have your email address, telephone number, postal address and the method you chose to make your purchase with. If you chose to have a delivery made to a third party address, then that will also be held on our records.

We maintain an order history of your purchase(s), which allows you and us to track your deliveries and review past purchases. We may offer you a promotion or reward we think you might like based on your order history. 

We currently plan on keeping all consumer data until we have completed a review and developed plans for its archiving, deletion or depersonalisation. This review will be complete within 12-18 months.

The data that we collect from you may be transferred, processed and stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").

If you have opted in to receive emails from Clarks your data will be transferred and stored by Alterian in USA. By submitting your personal details you agree to this transfer, storing and processing.

We collect data from your browsing behaviour on our website. No personal data is transferred or stored by Coremetrics in USA.

We collect marketing and website purchase data through Tagman, a tracking and analytics supplier in USA that help us improve our marketing campaigns.

We do not store any payment details. Once you have entered your payment details into the site we will use them for the transaction they have been entered for and that transaction only. 

  


## HR privacy

Information about you will be used for the purpose of determining your suitability for employment with Clarks. It may also be used for statistical analysis, for example to assess the success of advertising campaigns and different advertising media.

We may record information and opinions relating to you from third parties in the course of the recruitment process. You should note that your application may be subject to verification, for example your references may be taken up and any qualification which is indicated on your application may be verified by us contacting the appropriate body. This would not be done without your permission. We will not contact your current employer without your permission.

Your details will be accessible only by our authorised personnel and will not be disclosed to any third party except as required by law.

We comply with stringent safeguards to protect your personal data. If you would like any further information about your rights, which include rights of access to data, then please email us at recruitment@clarks.com.

  


## Email communications

If you have registered to receive emails from Clarks, you can remove your email address from the list at any time by using the links in the emails that are sent to you. We will never make your personal details available to other companies for marketing purposes.

We will endeavour to make all our communications clear in their intent. We will endeavour not to overuse your personal data.
