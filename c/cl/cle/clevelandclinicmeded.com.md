## Privacy Policy

The Cleveland Clinic Center for Continuing Education respects your privacy. We will never share, sell, or rent your personal information (including names, mailing addresses, fax/phone numbers or email addresses) with any other department, institution or any other 3rd party at any time for any reason. We will use this data solely to communicate information on various CME and educational activities that may be of interest and for no other purpose.

There are two ways in which we collect personal information through our online CME activities. The first is when an online user completes an activity and provides a name, address, email address, and telephone number. This information is stored in a database so that the Center may track the number of people using the website to obtain CME credit. This record-keeping is required by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education.

The second instance in which personal information is requested is during enrollment for our email update service. Users are asked to supply their names and email addresses in order to receive email alerts when new items are added to the website or when the Center announces other new educational offerings. An opt-out form enables news alert subscribers to unsubscribe at any time. We do not distribute unsolicited emails, nor share this data of our subscribers with any other department, institution or any other 3rd party at any time for any reason.

We do analyze our computer log file to determine which pages are visited most often and which external web sites refer the most visitors to clevelandclinicmeded.com. The Center performs periodic basic demographic analyses, including optional website user surveys, for the express purpose of tailoring future online CME activities to meet the greatest need and interest.
