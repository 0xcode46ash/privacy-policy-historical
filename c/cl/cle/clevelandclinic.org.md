# The Cleveland Clinic Contact Us

* What you should know about information we send to you 

Please remember that medical information provided by The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, in the absence of a visit with a health care professional, must be considered as an educational service only. The information sent through e-mail should not be relied upon as a medical consultation. Information we send you by e-mail is not designed to replace a physician's independent judgement about the appropriateness or risks of a procedure for a given patient. We will do our best to provide you with information that will help you make your own health care decisions. 

While we are very interested in providing relevant personal healthcare information to patients and/or their physicians, we will not make such information available online until we are confident that the information is secure. 

* How we use information you provide us 

Our Web site contains forms through which users may request information or supply feedback to us. In some cases, telephone numbers or return addresses are required so that we can supply requested information to you. Please note that our forms are NOT encrypted unless otherwise noted. Therefore people who are actively attempting to intercept web transmissions may be able to read information you send to us. But once the information is sent to our site, it is kept in secure databases where it is not available to users on the Internet. 

* Why we track where you go on our web site 

In order to understand how our web site is being used, we do typical web traffic analyses through which we track which pages are visited in what order, where users come from, and how long users spend on our site. We never associate such information with specific identities. The only exception to this is if you have given us explicit permission to do so by filling out a form that asks you if we may track you. After you fill out a form, we might contact you ourselves with follow-up information 

* When we use your email address 

If you ask us a question and provide your email address, we will answer that question via e-mail. On some forms we also tell you that we will add your name to a health information distribution list UNLESS YOU ASK US NOT TO. Those forms contain an opt-out check-box labeled "Please do NOT send me any health information"). We will occasionally send health information to people who do not opt out. In most cases, we will use the subject of the message you sent us to decide whether to include you in that electronic mailing. 

* The (non)security of email 

Please be aware that normal email is not encrypted. Active snoopers may be able to read email that we send you. If you ask us a question and supply your email address, you are authorizing us to respond to you with an unencrypted e-mail message that may contain private information about you or your question. While we are responsible for the privacy of messages that we store on the network, we cannot be responsible for the privacy of those messages once we have transmitted them to you or to your e-mail provider. 

* Our policy is not to share information with others 

We do not provide any information supplied on Web form to any outside organization for any reason other than where we may be required to by law, or as necessary to process credit card information. 

* How we handle credit card numbers 

While we sometimes ask for credit card numbers, we either pass them on to a credit card processing service or process them manually. We do not store credit card numbers online.
