## Introduction

ClearSlide, Inc. (" **ClearSlide** ," " **us** ," or " **we** ") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy describes ClearSlide's information practices.

ClearSlide provides a variety of web-based and mobile services designed specifically for the communication needs of sales teams (the "Services"). The Services are made available to users who have ClearSlide accounts ("Customers") via the web site located at www.clearslide.com (the "Site"). ClearSlide Customers use the Services to communicate with their customers and sales prospects ("Viewers"). The Services allow Customers to upload presentations, sales collateral and other content ("Content") to the Site, in addition to information about Viewers. Customers then use the Services to communicate with Viewers and share Content in a variety of ways, including via email and browser-based online presentations. Customers retain all rights to Content they upload to the ClearSlide Service. ClearSlide will not access or modify Content except as necessary to provide the Services, prevent or resolve service or technical problems, or at Customer's request in connection with support matters. ClearSlide will not disclose Customer Content except as described in this privacy policy or the agreement governing Customer's use of our Services, or for purposes of allowing Customer to share Content with Viewers via the Services.

Throughout this policy we will use the term personally identifiable information (" **PII** ") to describe information that can be used to identify a person. We do not consider all information to be PII, and we do not consider information that has been anonymized to be PII.

The Site and Services (including Content viewed thereon) may contain links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the information practices or the content of such other web sites. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of other web sites to understand their information practices.

## Cookies

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computing device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user's computing device.

When you access ClearSlide's Site or use our Services to access Content that has been sent to you we may place cookies on your computer or other computing device. We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret them and the information stored within. You may decline our cookies if your browser permits it, but doing so will interfere with your use of our Site and Services, and will impact the performance, operation and delivery of Services to you.

## With Whom Will We Share Your Information?

Our primary goal in collecting any information from you, including PII, is to provide you with the best Service we can. We believe we offer a unique Service which greatly improves the ability of our customers to sell and communicate to their customers. ClearSlide does not share, sell, rent, or trade PII with third parties for their promotional purposes.

ClearSlide may share information collected from you with third party service providers that perform work on ClearSlide's behalf or which ClearSlide utilizes to deliver, monitor, or improve the Site and Services. ClearSlide may, at your request and on your behalf, share your information with your own third party service providers (for example, information about your use of the Site and Services may be shared via API with a CRM system such as Salesforce).

## We may also share your information in connection with the following:

**Legal Compliance** : ClearSlide reserves the right to use or disclose any information provided by Visitors, Customers or Viewers if required by law or if ClearSlide reasonably believes that use or disclosure is necessary to protect the ClearSlide's rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process.

**As Part of an Asset Transfer** : In the event ClearSlide goes through a business transaction such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets to which this privacy policy relates, your information will likely be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur.

**Cross-Border Transfer** : Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, or other governmental jurisdiction where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside of the United States and choose to provide PII to us, we may transfer the information to the United States and processes it there.

## Security

ClearSlide protects your information online by using industry standard encryption methods to prevent unauthorized access to Content, data, and Customer account information stored on our servers. To learn more about encryption generally, please [click here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption).

When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, please click here. We encrypt PII in our databases, and we use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to transmit and receive this information from you.

ClearSlide and its service providers also maintain strict physical security at properties and facilities and only provide access to authorized personnel.

Access to the information you provide us with is restricted to those of our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Site or Services.

While we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Site or Services, you can email us at [security@clearslide.com](mailto:security@clearslide.com).

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided ClearSlide with PII, he or she should contact us at [security@clearslide.com](mailto:security@clearslide.com).
