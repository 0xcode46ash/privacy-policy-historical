## Other Information SPD May Collect

This Site may also collect information from you that is not personally identifiable. For example, SPD may track information about the date and time visitors access our site, the type of web browser they used, and the Site from which they connected to the site using Cookies.

"Cookies," are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. SPD may use cookies to collect information during your visit to this site, such as information about which site areas you visit and the services you use through the site. SPD collects this information to help tailor the site and its products and services to your needs and interests. Cookies may also be used to help speed up your future use of the site. For example, the site may recognise that you have provided Personal Information and ensure that you are not asked to provide the same information again. Most browsers are initially set to automatically accept a cookie. If you prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. Refusal of cookies at the site may mean that you cannot visit certain areas of the site or receive personalised information when you visit the site.

In addition, SPD is constantly trying to improve how it promotes its Site. To help SPD do this, it may measure the effectiveness of the web presence by finding out when you accessed the Site, and what you clicked on within the site.

Information about your computer, such as your IP address (a number assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Internet), the type of Internet browser you are using and the type of operating system you are using, may also be collected and linked to your Personal Information. This is to ensure that the site presents the best web experience for visitors, and that it is an effective information resource.

Some of the pages you visit may also collect information through the use of pixel tags (also called “clear gifs”) that may be shared with third parties which directly support SPD’s promotional activities and Site development. For example, Site usage information about visits to the site may be shared with a third party advertising agency to better target internet banner advertisements on the site. The information collected through the use of these pixel tags is not personally identifiable although it could be linked to your Personal Information.

Finally, SPD may supplement the information that you provided with other information held or that is received from third parties. SPD does this to provide more targeted products and services to meet your needs.
