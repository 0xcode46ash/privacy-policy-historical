### Privacy Information for Visitors to ClearFit.com – Collection and Use

When you arrive at ClearFit.com you may visit various areas of our site and click on certain links and buttons to search for and review additional information about career opportunities, potential candidates and the ClearFit Program.

### Log Files

Generally speaking, we gather statistical information by logging IP addresses, browser type, operating system, referring/exit page, date/time stamp, and aggregate survey results. The logged information is only used in the aggregate and is not tied to personally identifiable information. For example, we will keep a record of the aggregate number of visitors who access each area of our site, which areas of our site receive the heaviest traffic and what services offered through ClearFit are utilized most frequently. The information collected by us will assist in the continual process of updating and improving our site so that your visit to ClearFit will be as rewarding and complete as possible. From time to time we may share this aggregate statistical information with our participating employers and partners in an effort to enhance their understanding of how ClearFit is being used by visitors so they may take steps to help make your experience on our site and their site a very positive one. We use a third-party tracking service called Google Analytics that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. Google Analytics can determine whether you are a new or returning visitor, the time of the current visit and what the referrer site the visitor came from. We also use this to track page and site usage on our site ClearFit.com

### Membership

Becoming a ClearFit Member allows Individuals to enjoy Career Feedback Reports and Employers to receive special products, pricing and promotions that are not available to non-members. Membership was created to help Individuals learn more about their work-related personality and motivation characteristics and learn what jobs and employers fit them best. Membership was created for Employers to help them learn more about their Fingerprint(R) job profiles, candidates and employees. ClearFit.com is primarily a career survey and job matching site comprised of a ClearFit for Individuals service for individual career seekers and a ClearFit for Employers service for employers. In order to provide our unique service to members, we are required to collect relevant psychometric, job search and recruitment-related information during member registration. For career seekers, this information includes the results of their ClearFit Online Survey, employment history, past education, skills, certifications and contact information and it is stored in our central server database behind a hardware firewall at the ClearFit.com server. We call this the career seeker’s PersonalFingerprint™ personal profile information. For employers, this information includes their job description criteria, candidates, hiring criteria, including education, personality, motivation, experience criteria and contact information and it is stored in our central server database behind a hardware firewall at the ClearFit.com server. We call this the employer’s Fingerprint job profile and Registration information. The psychometric survey involves 146 questions and employment/education-related criteria which compare members against employers’ corresponding job-related criteria in the database, based on personality, interests and other job-related criteria. The career reports individual members receive as part of the ClearFit application process are theirs alone and completely confidential. Members always control who has access to their personally identifiable information. Participating ClearFit employers may access members’ PersonalFingerprint™ personal profile data and the interpretation of raw survey scores to create their own reports, but not their personally-identifiable information without that member’s consent. When a member applies to an employer using the ClearFit web site, they are consenting to allow that employer the ability to request their personally identifiable information. Employers will use this information during their hiring process to make more accurate hiring decisions, based on how candidates’ PersonalFingerprint personal profiles match against their JobFingerprint job profiles.

Members agree that their information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which ClearFit and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices, including, without limitation, the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Philippines and Australia. ClearFit will comply with the various Privacy and Data Protection Acts and Laws in the countries in which it operates. Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with an appropriate law enforcement investigation, current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

ClearFit collects but does not store credit card information when you purchase any of our products using a credit card.

### Feedback/Communication and Choice

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys, email communications or contests. Participation in these surveys, email communications or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose their job search-related information. Information requested may include any job search-related information, such as contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Information collected will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use, satisfaction and services of this site.

When you take that next step and register as a member of ClearFit, we will receive specific information about you, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, etc. In return for the service you receive from ClearFit, from time to time we may contact you in an effort to determine the level of satisfaction with the services provided through ClearFit.com, or we may contact you about opportunities that fit your JobFingerprint job profile or PersonalFingerprint personal profile. However, we WILL NOT, under any circumstances, provide your email address or any other personal or job search-related information to third party organizations you have not directly applied to, without your direct consent at the time said information is being provided or as described in this privacy policy.

Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. Users who no longer wish to receive contact from ClearFit or from our partners may opt-out of receiving further communications from a particular party by replying with unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at info@ClearFit.com

### How is personally-identifiable information disclosed?

USERS OF OUR SITE ARE ALWAYS NOTIFIED WHEN THEIR PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IS BEING COLLECTED BY ANY THIRD PARTIES. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require a third party, or not. Personally-identifiable information collected by ClearFit will not be sold, rented or provided in any other way to third parties except as described in this privacy policy.

ClearFit may, on occasion, with your consent, share some or all of your personally identifiable information with third party service providers for processing (such as when employers use other third party recruitment software providers). In order to process credit card transactions, ClearFit must share your credit card information with our credit card processors to complete our billing process. These third parties may be located in other jurisdictions. Therefore, your information may be processed and stored in other jurisdictions and, as a result, other governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through foreign laws. All such third party processors are bound by contract not to use the members personally identifiable information for their own purposes including their own marketing purposes or provide it to any third parties.

We may disclose and ultimately transfer personally identifiable information in the context of a business transaction involving the reorganization, acquisition or merger of our business or the sale of all or some of our assets provided that the personal information disclosed is required to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring this information. In such event, after a reorganization, acquisition, merger or sale has occurred, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you (either by posting notice on the Site or by email to you at the last known email address) that such a business transaction has occurred.

### ClearFit Referral Program

ClearFit does not store the referred person or employer’s email address until they register as members of ClearFit themselves. We do not sell referral email addresses to any third parties. We at ClearFit strongly encourage all our members not to engage in spamming activities. The referred party may contact ClearFit at info@ClearFit.com to request the removal of this information from our database.

### Security

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and off-line.

Our site uses a high-grade 256-bit AES encryption algorithm to keep your data secure. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a physically-secure environment.

Despite our best efforts, we are not and will not be responsible in the event that a third party (for example, a hacker) evades our security measures and gains access to the central database, and, subsequently, your personally identifiable information.

You are solely responsible for safeguarding and maintaining the secrecy of your account, passwords and/or any account information in your possession or control.

## Anti-Spam Policy

### Spam Defined

ClearFit.com strictly prohibits members engaging in spam and other tactics which may constitute abuse of the Internet in order to seek referrals. What is Spam? Generally speaking, activities which would constitute spam include the sending of: (i) unsolicited commercial e-mail, (ii) unsolicited bulk e-mail, (iii) mass e-mail, and/or (iv) junk e-mail, containing a message that advertises goods or services. The defining feature of spam is that the e-mail is sent to someone without their prior consent or in the absence of a previous relationship between the sender and the recipient. Spam is the electronic equivalent of the junk mail you receive in your postal mailbox every day or those telemarketers who call at dinner time!

Spam can take several different forms. When someone logs on to Usenet or message boards and sends or posts messages which are unrelated to the topic of discussion, that’s spam. In addition, the sending of an electronic mail message addressed to a recipient with whom the sender does not have an existing business or personal relationship or is not sent at the request of, or with the express consent of, the recipient constitutes spam. The act of engaging in activities which constitute spam is called spamming.

Other types of Internet abuse may also qualify as spam. Examples include, spamming of chat rooms and spamming via Internet Relay Chat or "Instant Messaging" systems (such as ICQ). In reality, the various methods of spamming will continue to evolve with the Internet as new ways of online communication between people develop.

### We Don’t Like Spam

No one likes sorting through junk mail or talking to telemarketers, but spam is even worse! Electronic junk mail costs recipients of spam more time and money than it costs the sender. The unwitting recipient of spam is required to download, sort through, and identify what e-mail is legitimate and what e-mail is junk e-mail, and then discard it. If the recipient pays for Internet access by the hour or minute, then sorting through spam messages leads to increased time online, which translates into higher monthly bills from their Internet Service Provider.

Conduct on the Internet is governed by an unwritten set of rules called ‘Netiquette,’ and one of those rules is that it's not acceptable to send out unsolicited mass e-mail. Spam can also slow the performance of the Internet. There have been instances where large volumes of spam have slowed down e-mail delivery for hours (or even days!). Spam sometimes causes computers on the Internet to crash. Most importantly, we feel that spamming is just plain rude.

### Our Anti-Spam Policy

ClearFit’s referral program is meant to encourage people to introduce the benefits of ClearFit to their friends and family, and to people with whom they transact with online. We do not intend to, nor do we encourage, the use of spam under any circumstances.

Upon receipt of a credible complaint concerning spamming, ClearFit may immediately suspend the membership of the individual who is alleged to have conducted the spamming. A suspension of membership privileges is intended to prevent a possible spammer from continuing to benefit from their activities by prohibiting the registration of referrals or the accruing of additional referral payments. If the spamming incident is not verified after a through investigation by ClearFit , the suspension may be lifted and all referrals and referral payments which have accrued during the period of suspension will be restored. ClearFit may, but is not obligated to, lift a suspension imposed on a member due to alleged spamming activities.

Anyone who is found by ClearFit to have spammed other Internet users in an attempt to gain referral bonuses will lose their ClearFit membership privileges and their account will be terminated. Any referral bonuses acquired in the spammer’s account will be confiscated by ClearFit . Any monies which remain in the spammer’s account after confiscation of referral bonuses will be returned to the account holder.

### How to Report Spammers

If you feel that a member of ClearFit has spammed you, please contact info@ClearFit.com. Be sure to include evidence of the spamming such as a copy of the e-mail, posting or message with full message headers or the usenet message. It would assist our efforts in confirming your complaint if you include any other information that can be used to identify the parties involved. An incomplete complaint may result in delays in the enforcement of our Anti-Spam Policy.

### How do I avoid engaging in Spam when making Referrals?

We created the ClearFit Referral Program to reward our members for introducing the ClearFit Program to their friends and family, and to people they transact with online. There are many ways in which you can participate in our referral program without resorting to spam. Here are a few guidelines to help you:

* Make sure you know the Person.

You can tell anyone who you know and whom you think might benefit from our service about ClearFit.com and the ClearFit Program. This includes friends, family, business and other acquaintances. In addition you should feel free to talk to anyone who asks you for information about ClearFit.com or the ClearFit Program.

### * Spreading the Word!

Email is the fastest and easiest way to tell your friends, family, business and other acquaintances about ClearFit.com and the ClearFit Program, however, you can also use old-fashioned word-of mouth to tell your friends about us. When you visit the ClearFit Referral Center, you will be able to select a referral e-mail that you can personalize or forward as is to interested parties. In the e-mail, we include your User Name, identifying you as the referring party. When your friend enters your User Name when they sign up, you are automatically eligible for a referral bonus whenever they are hired successfully by a ClearFit company.

Please use the ClearFit Referral Program responsibly. We strictly enforce our Anti Spam Policy!
