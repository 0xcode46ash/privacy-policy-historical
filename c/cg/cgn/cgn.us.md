# Privacy Policy - CGN

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available in our footer and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

Log files are maintained and analysed of all requests for files on this website's web servers. Log files do not capture personal information but do capture the user's IP address, which is automatically recognized by our web servers. 

**Our Commitment to Children's Privacy**  
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

**Cookies**  
This website does not store any information that would, on its own, allow us to identify individual users of this service without their permission. Any cookies that may be used by this website are used either solely on a per session basis or to maintain user preferences. Cookies are not shared with any third parties.

**Anonymity**  
Being anonymous online – or allowing anonymous people to engage with you – is a choice. Collection Gaming Network is committed to offering that choice in a responsible manner. That means we take responsibility for holding all users accountable to our Terms of Use and are committed to taking action (such as suspending accounts or sharing information with law enforcement) when warranted. It also means we need to make the tools around anonymity, blocking and reporting super easy to access and use, so that our users are able to make responsible choices on the Collection Gaming Network.
