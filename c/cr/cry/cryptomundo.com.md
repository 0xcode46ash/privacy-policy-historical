Cryptomundo may launch a discussion board service on some or all of the Cryptomundo Site where users can discuss common topics of interest.

Cryptomundo uses this information to screen users who leave comments in violation of our Terms and will not disclose any readily identifiable personal information to any other organization.

The discussion board service may use cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

By accepting a cookie from the Cryptomundo Site, users will not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on the site’s discussion board. We store a cookie on each user’s machine that contains a username and encrypted password. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you may not be able to use Cryptomundo products or services that require you to sign in, and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings.

This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track aggregate movements of users, and gather demographic information. This information is not associated to personally identifiable information. We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement.

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, Cryptomundo may need to disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process. Cryptomundo also may disclose information about its users to law enforcement officers or others, in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms and Privacy Policy, to respond to claims of violation of third party rights, and to protect property and personal safety.
