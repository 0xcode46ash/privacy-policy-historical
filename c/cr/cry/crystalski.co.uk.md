# Data Protection | Crystal Ski

### TUI UK Limited's Privacy Policy sets out what information we collect, how we collect it, and what we do with it.

### Information about you

**Your information:** This refers to information such as your name, contact details, travel preferences and special needs/disabilities/dietary requirements that you supply us or is supplied to us, including any information about other persons on your booking relating to the same ("your information"). Your information is collected when you request information from us, contact us (and vice versa) or make a booking with us. You are responsible for ensuring that other members of your party are aware of the content of our Privacy Policy and consent to your acting on their behalf in all your dealings with us.

We will update your information whenever we get the opportunity to keep it current, accurate and complete.

### Our Use of Your Information

(1) For the purpose of providing you with our services, including your flight, holiday or insurance, etc., we may disclose your information to our service providers (who could be located outside the UK/EEA). In order for you to travel overseas, it may be mandatory (as requested government authorities at the point(s) of departure and/or destination) to disclose your information for immigration, security and anti-terrorism purposes, or any other purposes which they determine appropriate. Even if not mandatory, we may exercise our discretion to assist where appropriate.

(2) We may collect and use your information for the purposes set out in our registration with the Office of the Information Commissioner, and disclose the same to our "group companies" (some of whom are outside the UK/EEA) for business purposes. We may also disclose your information to companies who act as "data processors" on our behalf, or to our service providers operating systems or business functions on our behalf, some of whom are outside the UK/EEA. These purposes include administration, providing services (and contacting you where necessary), customer care, improving our service, business management and operation, re-organisation/structuring/sale of our business (or our group companies), risk assessment, security and crime prevention/detection, research and analysis, marketing, monitoring, measuring and assessing customer purchasing preferences and trends, dispute resolution, credit checking and debt collection.

(3) Some of your information (such as health or religion) may be considered "sensitive personal data" under the Data Protection Act 1998. We collect it to cater to your needs or act in your interest, and we are only prepared to accept sensitive personal data on the condition that we have your positive consent. By booking with us you also agree for your insurers, their agents and medical staff to disclose relevant information (which may contain sensitive personal data) to us in circumstances where we need to act in the interest of everyone in the group you are travelling with. For example, if your illness at resort is infectious we may need to make special arrangements for you and also ensure that you do not return with the group immediately.

If you do not agree to Our Use of Your Information above, we cannot do business with you or accept your booking. 

### Direct marketing material

(1) We may from time to time contact you with information on offers of goods and services, brochures, new products, forthcoming events or competitions from our holiday divisions and our group companies. Please note that our websites will assume you to agree to e-communications when you make a booking. You will be given the opportunity on every e-communication we send you to indicate that you no longer wish to receive our direct marketing material.

(2) You may indicate your preference regarding receiving third party direct marketing material.

(3) If do not wish to receive such information or would like to change your preference, please refer to point (2) of "Your Rights" below.

### Your rights

(1) You have the right to ask in writing by completing our Data Subject Access Request form for a copy of the information we hold about you (for which we may charge a fee) and to correct any inaccuracies in your information.

(2) You have the right to ask in writing not to receive direct marketing material about our products and services. If the following facilities are available, you can amend your previous preference on our website(s), use our "unsubscribe email" or in literature which you subsequently return to us. Once properly notified by you, we will take steps to stop using your information in this way.

(3) If you would like a list of our group companies or brands, please send us your request.
