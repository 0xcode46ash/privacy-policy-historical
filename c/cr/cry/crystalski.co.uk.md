# Welcome to Crystal Ski Holidays -

  


We have made every effort to ensure that the information on this website is accurate and all information is updated regularly. However, all flights and holidays are subject to availability and may be subject to price changes prior to confirmation of your booking. We take great care to ensure brochure and website accuracy but services and facilities may change or be withdrawn and information may change. We regularly update information to display up to date text but please note that any late changes will be shown as an erratum during the booking process. Prices for holidays and flights change frequently. Whilst we check regularly to try to ensure that holidays and flights are available at the prices shown, we cannot guarantee the availability of any holiday or flight at an advertised price. However, the current price will be displayed before you confirm your booking. All prices are in sterling and include taxes, unless otherwise indicated. 

All agreements will be made in England and are governed by English law and are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts. Prices shown may change and are subject to availability. 

TUI UK Limited is committed to protecting your privacy and this Privacy Policy sets out what information we collect, how we collect it, and what we do with it. 

  
This refers to information such as your name, contact details, travel preferences and special needs/disabilities/dietary requirements that you supply us or is supplied to us, including any information about other persons on your booking relating to the same (“your information”). Your information is collected when you request information from us, contact us (and vice versa) or make a booking with us. You are responsible for ensuring that other members of your party are aware of the content of our Privacy Policy and consent to your acting on their behalf in all your dealings with us. We will update your information whenever we get the opportunity to keep it current, accurate and complete. Our Use of Your Information   
(1) We may disclose your information to our service providers (who could be located outside the UK/EEA) for the purpose of providing you with our services, including your flight, holiday or insurance, etc. Only information necessary for this purpose will be disclosed to them. For air travel, it may be a mandatory requirement (imposed on airlines by governments at the point(s) of departure and/or destination) to disclose your information for security and anti-terrorism purposes, or any other purposes which they determine appropriate.   
(2) We may use your information for the purposes set out in our data protection registration with the Office of the Information Commissioner, and disclose the same to our “group companies” (i.e. our holding companies and all group companies of our holding companies, some of which are outside the UK/EEA) for business purposes. We may also disclose your information to companies who act as “data processors” on our behalf. These purposes include administration, providing services (and contacting you where necessary), customer care, improving our service, business management and operation, re-organisation/structuring of our business (or our group companies), risk assessment, security and crime prevention/detection, research and analysis, marketing, monitoring, assessing customer purchasing preferences, dispute resolution, credit checking and debt collection. If we search against the files of credit reference agencies, they will record the search and hence the way in which you conduct your account with us may be shared with other lenders and credit agencies.   
(3) Some of your information may be considered “sensitive personal data” under the Data Protection Act 1998. (For example, information relating to health or religion.) We collect it to cater to your needs or act in your interest, but we do so on the condition that we have your positive consent – we will do all that is reasonably practicable to draw this to your attention when you first supply us with your information, or at the next available opportunity. By booking your holiday with us you also agree for your insurers, their agents and medical staff to disclose relevant information (which may contain sensitive personal data) to us in circumstances where we need to act in the interest of everyone in the group you are travelling with. For example, if your illness at resort is infectious we may need to make special arrangements for you and also ensure that you do not return with the group immediately.   
If you do not agree to our use of your information, we cannot do business with you or accept your booking.

  
(1) We may from time to time contact you by post with information on offers of goods and services, brochures, new products, forthcoming events or competitions from our holiday divisions and our holiday group companies.   
(2) You may indicate your preference to also receive our direct marketing material for the above purposes by telephone or e-communications (e-mail, SMS or e-brochure) on our website(s) or forms, or to our staff at the time you first supplied us your information.   
(3) You may, in addition, indicate your preference regarding receiving third party direct marketing material by post.   
(4) If do not wish to receive such information or would like to change your preference, please refer to point (2) of “Your Rights” below. 

  
(1) You have the right to ask in writing by completing our Data Subject Access Request form for a copy of the information we hold about you (for which we may charge a fee) and to correct any inaccuracies in your information.   
(2) You have the right to ask in writing not to receive direct marketing material about our products and services. If the following facilities are available, you can amend your previous preference on our website(s), using our “unsubscribe e-mail” or in literature which you subsequently return to us. Once properly notified by you, we will take steps to stop using your information in this way.   
(3) If you would like a list of our group companies or brands, please send us your request.   
Our registered address is at TUI UK Limited, Greater London House, Hampstead Road, London NW1 7SD. Please address your correspondence to the Group Company Secretary.

We, including our group companies, may disclose aggregate statistics about enquiries made, visitors, customers and sales in order to describe our services to prospective partners, purchasers, advertisers and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes.
