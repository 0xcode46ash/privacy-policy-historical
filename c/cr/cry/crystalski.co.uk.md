# Data Protection | Crystal Ski

TUI UK Limited's Privacy Policy sets out what information we collect, how we collect it, and what we do with it.

### Your Information 

This refers to a combination of information such as your name, contact details, travel preferences and special needs/disabilities/dietary requirements that you supply us or is supplied to us, including any information about other persons on your booking ("your information"). Your information is collected when you request information from us, contact us (and vice versa) or make a booking. You are responsible for ensuring that other members of your party are aware of the content of our Privacy Policy and consent to your acting on their behalf in all your dealings with us.

We will update your information whenever we can to keep it current, accurate and complete.

### Our Use of Your Information 

  1. For the purpose of providing you with our services, including your flight, holiday or insurance, etc., we may disclose and process your information outside the UK/EEA. In order for you to travel abroad, it may be mandatory (as required by government authorities at the point(s) of departure and/or destination) to disclose and process your information for immigration, border control, security and anti-terrorism purposes, or any other purposes which they determine appropriate. These requirements may differ depending on your destination and you are advised to check. Even if not mandatory, we may exercise our discretion to assist where appropriate.
  2. We may collect and process your information for the purposes set out in our registration with the Office of the Information Commissioner, and disclose the same to our group companies for business purposes and also to companies and our service providers who act as "data processors" on our behalf, or to credit and fraud agencies (some of whom are located outside the UK/EEA). These business purposes include administration, providing services (and contacting you where necessary), customer care, service quality, business management and operation, re-organisation/structuring/sale of our business (or group companies), risk assessment, security, fraud and crime prevention/detection, monitoring, research and analysis, marketing, customer purchasing preferences and trends, dispute resolution, credit checking and debt collection.
  3. Information (such as health or religion) may be considered "sensitive personal data" under the Data Protection Act 1998. We collect it to cater to your needs or act in your interest, and we are only prepared to accept sensitive personal data on the condition that we have your positive consent. By booking with us you also agree for your insurers, their agents and medical staff to disclose relevant information and sensitive personal data to us in circumstances where we need to act on your behalf or in the interest of passengers or in an emergency.



### If you do not agree to Our Use of Your Information above, we cannot do business with you or accept your booking.

### Direct Marketing Material 

  1. We may from time to time contact you with information on offers of goods and services, brochures, new products, forthcoming events or competitions from our holiday divisions and our group companies. Our websites will assume you to agree to e-communications when you make a booking.
  2. You may indicate your preference regarding receiving third party direct marketing material.
  3. If do not wish to receive such information or would like to change your preference, please refer to point (2) of "Your Rights" below.



### Your Rights 

  1. On completing our Data Subject Access Request form, you are entitled to a copy of the information we hold about you (for a Â£10 fee) and to correct any inaccuracies.
  2. You have the right to ask in writing not to receive direct marketing material from us. If available, you can amend your previous preference on our website(s), use our "unsubscribe email" or refer to our literature containing instructions. Once properly notified by you, we will take steps to stop using your information in this way.
  3. For a list of our group companies or brands, please send us your request.

### Cookies

**What is a cookie?**

Cookies are small files that are sent to your browser, for example Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Firefox. They are stored on your computer's hard disk and only identify your computer, and not you personally.

The default location for these files is:  
**Windows** : c:\Documents and Settings\\{your_username}\Cookies  
**Mac** : Users\\{your_username}\Library\Cookies

There are two main purposes to cookies. The first is to add functionality like shopping carts, logging in as a particular user, remembering preferences and sharing links via social media. Secondly, cookies are used by website owners to collect usage data and provide personalised suggestions and information.

**How do we use cookies?**

Cookies help to speed up the booking process so that you do not need to re-type the same information again and again. If you are making a purchase we will also use cookies to keep track of the transaction from one page to the next. We do not store any personal information in the cookie.

We also collect information relating to customer use and patterns. We use cookies and software tools to capture, measure and analyse site usage and related information.

When you are on our website, we use cookies to provide you with a more personal experience.

If you come back to the site at a later date then you'll be able to see any properties you have been researching recently.

When you are online but not using our website, to help us deliver advertising effectively and avoid repeating adverts, we work with carefully selected third parties who we allow to employ cookies on our site, on our behalf. These cookies allow us to provide advertising on other websites that are more relevant to a user's interests. The information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain a user's name, address, telephone number or email address.
