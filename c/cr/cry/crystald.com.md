**What information does Eidos Interactive collect and how it will be used?**

In order to give you the best experience on our site, Eidos will collect information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Typically, we ask you to submit personal and/or demographic information if you wish to do any of the following on our Web site: (1) register a product; (2) register on a particular game site; (3) participate in Eidos' interactive forums; (4) subscribe to the Eidos newsletter; (5) purchase a product at our online store; and/or, (6) submit your resume to Eidos. The types of information requested for each activity and the way the information is used are detailed below. 

·        _**Product Registration**_

When you register a product with us, you will be asked to provide personal information such as your name, home address, email address, and date of birth. Some Web users have the ability to give us their telephone number as well. In addition, we collect demographic information such as your gender, information about the game you purchased, your favorite game type and the type of console you own. The information that you submit to us during product registration is used to send you the latest product updates and game patches via email and information about new games and special offers from the Eidos store. Your product registration is also used to make you eligible to win a free Eidos Interactive Game, given out randomly each month. 

·        _**Game Site Registration**_

Many of the Eidos' games feature their own Web site where you can register to receive information that pertains to a particular game (e.g., Deus Ex). To sign up for this service, we ask you for personal information such as your name, date of birth and email address in addition to demographic information including your country, game platform and favorite game. We use this information to send you the hottest news, exclusive details, special promotions and cool contests relating to a particular game. 

·        _**Interactive Forums**_

This area of our Web site allows you to use our Bulletin Board, modify your Bulletin Board profile and subscribe to our forum digests. To use all three of these features, you must first register and provide us with certain information, including your username and password, email address, occupation and the city, state and country in which you live. With the exception of your password, the information you provide when registering will be viewable by anyone visiting the bulletin board and allows our bulletin board administrators and moderators to send you email notices. If, at a later time, you wish to update the information you submitted while registering, you will be asked to submit your username and password for verification. Finally, if you subscribe to a particular forum digest, you will be prompted to provide your username and password so that we can send you periodic emails detailing posts to that forum over a given period of time. Only registered members of our forums may subscribe to a forum digest. 

·  **         ******_**Newsletter**_ ** __**

To subscribe to the Eidos newsletter, we ask you to provide your username and password. This information is used to inform you, via our newsletter, about new products, features and enhancements, promotional offers, and other events of interest.   

·         _**Online Store**_

Eidos Interactive's on-line store is managed by Digital River. To purchase goods and/or services from our on-line store, you will need to provide Digital River with a valid credit card number and expiration date, billing and shipping addresses in addition to your name and telephone number. Digital River uses any personal information collected in this manner solely for the purpose of completing the transaction and shall take adequate and appropriate measures to assure the confidentiality, security, and integrity of this personal information in a manner consistent with Digital River’s privacy practices and data security policies.

·         _**Resumes**_

Eidos Interactive allows for the online submission of resumes. Personal information collected from resumes will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings. This information may be shared within the company.

In addition to the uses specified above, we also use your personal and demographic information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs. No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.

**What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information?**

 If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you will not be able to participate in certain activities on our site and you will limit the services we can provide you. For example, you will not be able to use certain features of the Bulletin Board or purchase a game. However, to simply use our site, you do not need to give us any personal information. 

**Does Eidos Interactive use cookies, track IP Addresses or use other passive means to collect information?   **

** ** Eidos Interactive uses cookies on its Web site. Cookies are small pieces of information that are transferred and stored on your computer's hard drive, not on our site. Cookies do not spy on you or otherwise invade your privacy, and they cannot invade your hard drive and steal information. In addition, cookies do not collect or store any personal information about you. Rather, they help you navigate a Web site as easily as possible. Eidos Interactive uses cookies to prevent you from having to reenter your registration data (e.g., username and password) at each connection and to store other default preferences, such as your preferred "topic view." If, however, your browser does not support cookies, or you have disabled cookies on your browser, these time-saving features will not work properly. 

Eidos Interactive also keeps track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for purposes of Web site security and safety. An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Your IP address is typically used to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.

Eidos Interactive uses clear GIFs (a.k.a., "Web bugs") as well. Web bugs are typically used to provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited our Web site. Web bugs are also used to gather statistics about how online visitors navigate and use our Web sites ("click stream data"). 

**Who is collecting my personal information?**

The information you provide to our Web site is collected and used by Eidos Interactive for the same reason the information was collected, as detailed above.   

From time to time, Eidos Interactive may employ third-party vendors, such as Digital River, to collect personal information on our behalf. These third parties provide _internal support_ to Eidos Interactive by operating some of the services we provide you and are therefore treated as internal. Digital River, for example, fulfills and delivers all game purchases made through our Web site. Although these third-party vendors, not Eidos Interactive, collect the personal information you provide when requesting such services, Eidos Interactive requires that they take adequate and appropriate measures to assure the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the collected information and that they _not_ share your personal information with outside third parties.

**With whom does Eidos Interactive share my personal information?**

Personal information collected by Eidos Interactive is kept strictly internal. Eidos Interactive does _not_ disclose any personal information to outside third parties. This policy, however, does not apply when Eidos Interactive is required to disclose personal information to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, or the unlikely event of bankruptcy, management of Eidos Interactive's customer information may be transferred to its successor or assign.

**What is Eidos Interactive's policy regarding links to other sites?**

 You should be aware that while you are on the Eidos Interactive Web site you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. Because we cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of these Web sites meet our high standards and the requirements of the ESRB Privacy Online Program, we recommend reading the privacy policy of the Web site to which you link before you submit any personal information.

**What choices we offer you regarding the use of your personal information?**

 If you do not want to receive communications from Eidos Interactive, you can always opt-out at the time of registration. If you initially chose to receive email communications from us and have now changed your mind, please contact us by phone at (415) 547-1200, via email at [webmaster@eidos.com](mailto:webmaster@eidos.com), or by regular mail at Privacy Policy Administrator, Eidos Interactive, 651 Brannan Street, Suite 400, San Francisco, CA 94107. We will be glad to remove your name from our mailing list. 

To take your email address off of a digest subscription list, please do so through our [Digest Subscription page](http://www.eidosgames.com/cgi-bin/ubbmail.cgi?action=subscribe). 

 In addition, along with every communication sent to you, Eidos Interactive gives you the opportunity to discontinue receiving further communications (i.e., unsubscribe). 

**How do I access my personal information?**  

If for any reason you wish to view, correct or delete the personal information collected about you, please send your request via email to [webmaster@eidos.com](mailto:webmaster@eidos.com) or write to our Privacy Policy Administrator at Eidos Interactive, 651 Brannan Street, Suite 400, San Francisco, CA. We will be happy to honor your request.  

Those Web users who are registered to use the Bulletin Board can update their personal information online by visiting the "profile" section of our Web site or by clicking [here](http://www.eidosgames.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=editbio&Browser=&DaysPrune=10&LastLogin=). For verification, you will be prompted to submit your username and password before being able to view your profile.  

**Does Eidos Interactive collect personal information from children under 13?**

 Eidos Interactive does not request and collect personal information such as name, address or email address from children younger than 13 years of age. We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and recommend that parents instruct their children not to disclose their personal information online. 

**What safeguards does Eidos Interactive use to protect my personal information?**

Eidos Interactive maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the personal information we collect. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. For example, personal information collected by Eidos Interactive is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public (e.g., locked rooms) and access to that information is limited to employees with proper identification. In addition, the Eidos Interactive online store, operated by Digital River, uses industry-standard technology (e.g., encryption) to prevent unauthorized electronic access to sensitive financial information such as your credit card number. 

**How do I ask a question or file a complaint?**

 If you have any questions, complaints or comments regarding our privacy policy or practices, please send an email to [webmaster@eidos.com](mailto:webmaster@eidos.com), call us at (415) 547-1200, or address written correspondence to:
