  * Crucial has security measures in place to keep your personal information secure. 
  * Crucial does not sell or share your personal information with other companies.



**Security**  
[](https://digitalid.verisign.com/as2/14c8cf073cd6bc0cdd132e255d09f044) Crucial's site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, including without limitation protecting information behind a firewall, encrypting your ordering information so that it cannot be read by a third party during transmission, and providing a secured intranet barrier between our servers and the Internet.

**Registration and order forms**  
If you choose to register with Crucial or to place an order with us, we may ask that you provide us with contact information (name and e-mail address), financial information (account or credit card numbers), demographic information (zip code, age, or income level), and unique identifiers (tax ID number). We do not purge customer information on a regular basis, so information you provide us will remain in our systems for an indefinite amount of time. We may use your contact information to send you information about us and to contact you when necessary. If you do not want to receive any mailings from us, please see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information is used only to bill you for products and to check your qualifications for registration. Demographic information may be used to tailor your experience at our sites, showing you information that we think you might be interested in, and presenting information according to your preferences. We may use demographic information to develop summary - but not individual - reports for our advertisers so that they may determine how effective their advertising investments are. We never tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements, unless you have specifically told us that this is acceptable. In addition, our sales and marketing departments may also use demographic information to measure interest in our products. We may use unique identifiers to verify our resellers and customers and to allow customers to identify themselves to us. 

**Surveys and contests**  
Crucial may invite you to participate in online surveys or contests. Participation is never required. If you choose to participate, you may be asked to disclose contact and demographic information. We may use this information to send you information about our company, contact you when necessary, tailor your experience at our site, and display information according to your preferences. If you do not want to receive any mailings from us, please see the choice/opt-out section below. This demographic information may also be used by our sales and marketing departments to measure interest in our products and may be shared with our advertisers on a summary, not individual, basis. 

**Public forums**  
Crucial may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to you. Because any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, you should exercise caution when deciding whether to disclose your personal information.

**Information requests**

  * We do not collect children's contact information without prior parental consent, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. Without prior parental consent, online information will only be used to respond directly to the child's request and for no other purpose. 
  * We do not collect children's personally identifiable offline contact information without prior parental consent. 
  * We do not distribute children's personal information to any third party without prior parental consent. 
  * We do not provide the ability to publicly post or otherwise transmit information that could be used to identify a child without prior parental consent. 
  * We do not entice children by the prospect of a special game, prize, or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity. 

**IP addresses**  
We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, administer our sites, and gather broad demographic information to measure general interest in our products and to share with our advertisers on a summary, not individual, basis.
