# Crusher Privacy Policy

CRUSHER PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT

We take your privacy seriously. How seriously? Read the following to learn more and please be aware that by visiting www.crush3r.com you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

**Information we gather automatically**  
Like all good web service providers Crusher is interested in anonymous data to improve the quality and usefulness of the Crusher service. That means that we will collect aggregate information on what pages users access or visit. We will not profile and store your individual activities and information for marketing purposes. Yuck.

**Information you provide Crusher**  
You can visit and use Crusher anonymously but when you create a free page using Crusher you must provide us with at least an email address to help us prevent abuse by malicious robots.

When you register for a free Crusher account you provide us with an email address and a password. Other information you provide is optional such as your name and cell phone number for SMS notifications. 

The personal information we collect will not be shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * 1\. Affiliated Businesses and Service that we do not control:
  * At your request, we will transfer information such as your user ID and login for affiliate services that we provide integration with (such as photo sharing services). Use of those services inside a Crusher page is subject to the Terms of use and Privacy Policies of the individual service providers. Please read their terms carefully.
  * 2\. Protection of Crusher and its users:
  * It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
  * 3\. Business transactions:
  * We may transfer information about you if Crusher is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Crusher will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



**What do we do with all that data?**  
Crusher uses collected information for the following general purposes:

  * • Products and services provision
  * • Billing
  * • Identification
  * • Authentication
  * • Services improvement
  * • Contact
  * • Research



**Hey wait, that my stuff!**  
Although Crusher owns or otherwise provides the data storage, databases and all rights to the Crusher application, you retain all rights to your data and we will never sell or share your client data with any third-parties. Did we mention that we respect the privacy of our users?

**Giving credit where credit is due**  
Crusher packs a punch in part thanks to services and technology provided by: 

  * • [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/about). Please note, their legal team would like you to know "this product uses the Flickr API but is not endorsed or certified by Flickr."  

  * • [Yahoo! Maps](http://yahoo.com/). Read more about their api here:  [Web Services by Yahoo!](http://developer.yahoo.net/about/)
  * • The [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) community.



**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that we store on your computer's hard drive and which tells us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Crusher cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is. Disabling Cookies will not block you from using Crusher but may disable features that rely on them.  


**Changes**  
Crusher may periodically update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Crusher primary account holder account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
