# About CruiseMates.com

PRIVACY POLICY  
A guarantee of confidentiality concerning personal information conveyed by CruiseMates Readers.

* * *

  
CruiseMates will NEVER release your individual personal information without your consent. It is not required to register to enter CruiseMates but access to a few features, notably "Meet on Board," "Trivia," "Bargain Finder," and a few others will not be enabled.

To register with CruiseMates, we require you to answer the following questions: 

> * **User Name:  
>  * Password  
>  * Email Address:  
>  * ZIP code:   
>  * Where did you hear about us?**   
> 

We also REQUEST that you tell us additional information, such as your age, income, cruising history and cruising preferences -- you are NOT required to fill out this information. The information you voluntarily submit in our member registration is used to gather important statistics about the general demographics of our overall readership audience.

**Aggregate statistical information:**  
We may convey aggregated profile data regarding our members. This data DOES NOT contain personally identifying information such as name or email address. Individual identifying information will NEVER be provided to any of our advertisers or anyone else without your consent. However, aggregated data from our members may be shared with our partners. For example, we may let our advertisers know that approximately "X% of our members have cruised 5 times or more." However, we would never tell them anything about individual consumers (such as their name) unless the individual has given his/her consent to be contacted directly.

Unfortunately, CruiseMates cannot be responsible for any third parties who enter CruiseMates with the intention of gathering usernames and/or email addresses for the purposes of solicitation. If you should be solicited by anyone without your consent you can forward the solicitation to CruiseMates and we will look into the matter to see what if any action can be taken.

**Other uses of information:**  
As we state above, we will never sell, exchange, or release our members' individual identifying information (such as their name, email address or preferences data) to a third party without your permission. Occasionally, we might send data files containing personal information (such as email addresses) to third party agents for data processing services. These third parties are restricted from using this data in any way other than to provide services for us, and may not use or resell the data.

According to S.2326, Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 currently pending in Congress Websites must provide notice of its personal information collection and use practices; obtain parental consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from children aged 12 and under; provide parents access to their child’s personal information; and establish and maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the confidentiality, security, accuracy, and integrity of personal information on children. CruiseMates supports and conforms with this pending legislation. The minimum age requirement to register with Cruisemates is 13. Any parents of children younger that 13 whose parents discover have registered with CruiseMates by lying about their age may contact us at [Editor](mailto:editor@cruisemates.com) to retrieve and delete the registration information of their children.

**How and when we contact you:**  
Cruisemates reserves the right to occasionally send its registered users email describing new articles, features or cruising opportunities offered by CruiseMates. You can opt out of these contacts completely, without giving up your right to remain a registered user of CruiseMates. See below for an explanation of how to do so.
