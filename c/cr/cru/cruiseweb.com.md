This includes the following types of information:

We use this information to help you select the cruise that is right for you and to communicate special offers to you.

Whenever making a reservation in your name, we forward any required information on to that cruise line. We do not sell or give this information to any other third parties.

The Cruise Web offers Cruise Deals that are periodic emails that contain special offers on cruises and vacations. You are automatically signed up for these deals when you complete a contact form.

At the bottom of every email you receive from The Cruise Web, there will be a link which will display a web page where you can opt out from receiving Cruise Deals and/or where you can change your preferences as to the type of offers you would like to receive.

As The Cruise Web respects your privacy, this privacy statement may be modified from time to time to properly reflect all business practices.
