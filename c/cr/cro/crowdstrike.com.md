DATA COLLECTION AND USE

### CrowdStrike Websites and Web Portals

CrowdStrike Websites provide Internet based access for users to learn about CrowdStrike and its Offerings and to communicate with CrowdStrike and with others. CrowdStrike web portals that may exist within our Offerings (“Web Portals”) provide customers with Internet based access to our Offerings. When an individual uses our Websites and Web Portals, CrowdStrike gathers information, some of which is personal information. Information collected and used by CrowdStrike may include, among other things, the Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser information, device ID, the type of computer and technical information about a user’s means of connection to our Websites or Web Portals, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information. From users who are required to login to gain access to a particular Website feature or Web Portal, we collect usernames, passwords, and other login credentials that are used for the purpose of verifying user authorization to access the feature or Offering.

We also use cookies and web beacons on our Websites and Web Portals. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. Cookies don’t read or modify data on the user’s computer. A web beacon is a small graphic file that is placed on the web page the user visits and is often used in conjunction with cookies. We use third party service providers to help us implement and utilize cookies and web beacons and to analyze the data they collect. In some cases, we link the information gathered by cookies and web beacons to a user’s personal information. We use cookies and web beacons to help our Websites and Web Portals function properly, to collect information about how users interact and use our Websites and Web Portals, to personalize or customize the user’s experience (based on preferences or geography, for example) on our Websites and Web Portals, and to gather information about a user’s browsing habits. We may also use cookies, web beacons and the data they collect to tailor our Websites, Web Portal and communications so they are more relevant to a user’s interests.

We may use the information, including personal information, that we collect from users of our Websites and Web Portals for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the following purposes:

### Websites

  * Operate, secure, support and improve our Websites
  * Provide you requested information and Offerings
  * Provide community forums, blogs and discussion groups
  * Run promotions, contests, surveys or other website features
  * Send periodic emails
  * Recruit new employees when you respond to career postings
  * Analyze trends



### Web Portals

  * Provide you our Offerings, including product updates, documentation, and related information
  * Operate, secure, support and improve our Web Portals and Offerings
  * Develop new features, products, and services
  * Send periodic emails
  * Analyze trends



We may transfer or provide access to personal information obtained through our Websites or Web Portals to individuals or companies that help us provide, operate, support, maintain, secure, and improve our Websites and Offerings.

If you opt-in to our mailing list, you will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, and other CrowdStrike related information. If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

If you make posts to our community forums or blogs, your words and identity are made available to other people using the forum or blog. We are under no obligation to publish, maintain or retain any of your posts. If you provide us with feedback about our company, Offerings or Websites, we consider this to be freely given and we may use your feedback without compensation or attribution to you.

If we have a referral service that you chose to use to tell a friend or other point of contact about us, we will ask you for the contact’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit our Website. CrowdStrike will store this information for the sole purpose of sending the one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral program. An individual whose name has been provided to us may contact us at privacy@crowdstrike.com to request that we remove their information from our database.

### Offerings

CrowdStrike has numerous Offerings, including but not limited to platform and cloud based security and intelligence subscription services, professional services, free community security tools, and more. All of our Offerings are centered on our mission to provide cutting-edge security solutions to our customers.

In order to accomplish our mission, CrowdStrike is leading the industry in Big Data Security, taking advantage of high volume, high velocity, and high variety information to reveal relationships, dependencies, and perform predictions of outcomes and behaviors in order to detect, contain, and mitigate network intrusions and identify the attackers. Most of the information CrowdStrike collects through its Offerings is _metadata_ , for example, data about how and when a device or network is being used, login times and attempts, registry keys, types and versions of operating systems, browsers and information about software applications. Some of the data we collect may be considered personal information depending on the laws of the location where it is collected, such as IP addresses. In some cases we collect personally identifiable information as it may appear within usernames, filenames, file paths, and machine names. However, we only use the data that we collect through our Offerings to help our customers and improve our capabilities in the way described in our more specific product or service documentation and agreements. CrowdStrike also offers customers the ability to directly provide to CrowdStrike, or for customers to have CrowdStrike Offerings configured to collect, files (including the content of those files) and other information related to the files for security analysis and response or, when submitting crash reports, to make the product more reliable. At your direction, we may also collect or retrieve files as part of our Offerings. The files and related information may contain personal information.

An important type of data we detect and collect through our Offerings (or provide our customers the ability to provide to us), analyze and use is information about adversaries, for example, malware and URLs where adversaries try to send your data. We often discover this type of information from analyzing samples customers provide to us or from the data we collect from customers through our Offerings. We use the information we collect about adversaries to help all of our customers and the public – DETECT, RESPOND, REVEAL. However, when we share information that we learn about adversaries, we don’t identify customers or individuals, other than of course the adversary, that’s the WHO, WHAT and WHY of our security mission.

To the extent CrowdStrike collects personal information through its Offerings, CrowdStrike collects that information under the authority and direction of its customers, which often are corporate entities. CrowdStrike typically has no direct relationship or contact with an individual whose personal information we may collect or receive from a corporate customer and subsequently analyze and use. Regardless, we do not use any personal information collected through our Offerings to contact or market products or services to these individuals. We also do not provide any personal information obtained through the Offerings to third parties for the purpose of contacting or marketing products or services to these individuals.

If you are a user of one of our Offerings, we will obtain the personal information you provide us during the sales and/or fulfillment process. We may use personal information collected such as name, phone number, mailing address, and email address to contact you and to provide you with Offerings, send you an invoice, perform accounting, auditing and collection activities, answer questions, provide support and tell you about other Offerings.

### How We Protect Your Information

The security of customer data and your personal information is not only important to us, it is our mission. We adopt data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of customer data and your personal information. We follow generally accepted practices to protect customer data and the personal information collected and submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have questions about the security of your personal information collected through our Offerings or Websites, you can contact us at privacy@crowdstrike.com.

### Retention of Personal Information

We will retain your personal information for as long as needed to fulfill the purpose for which we collected it and for a reasonable period thereafter in order to comply with audit, contractual or legal requirements. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may retain aggregated or de-identified data indefinitely or to the extent allowed by applicable law. We may retain personal information preserved in automatically generated computer back up or archival copies generated in the ordinary course of our information technology systems procedures.

You may request us to correct, update, amend or remove your personal information that you know or have reason to believe is in our possession by emailing us at [privacy@crowdstrike.com](mailto:privacy@crowdstrike.com) or by contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below. When contacting us, please provide us with detailed information about the personal information you are requesting we correct, update, amend, or remove, and the timeframe and manner in which you believe we came to collect it. We will respond to your request within 30 days. If we obtained your personal information from a customer or third party acting on your behalf, you should contact the company or person you provided your information to. In certain circumstances, we may be required by law or our auditors or other legitimate business purposes to keep information about you.

### Sharing Your Personal Information

We do not sell, trade, or rent the personal information we collect from our Websites to others. We may share aggregated demographic information regarding visitors and users of our Websites with our affiliates, business partners, and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. When we collect personal information through our Offerings it is made available to the CrowdStrike customer who was the source of the information and we use it as described in the Privacy Notice. We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business, and provide, support, maintain, or secure our Offerings and our Websites or administer activities on our behalf, such as marketing campaigns. It may be necessary to provide or allow access to your personal information to these third party service providers for those purposes. In addition, we provide information regarding our business to our auditors and legal counsel and, in some cases, that information may contain personal information, but they may only use it for the purpose of providing their professional services.

We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process when we believe that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. We may transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.

Our Websites include links to other websites and social media whose privacy practices may differ from those of CrowdStrike. If you submit personal information to any of those sites or services, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy notice of any website or social media service you visit.

CrowdStrike’s mission is worldwide, and therefore, we may store information in the United States and other locations worldwide where we, or our service providers, have facilities.

This Privacy Notice does not pertain to personal information of CrowdStrike employees.

### Changes to this Privacy Notice

CrowdStrike may update this Privacy Notice at any time to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make significant changes in how we use your personal information, we will notify you by email if feasible or by means of a notice on this Website. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

### Your Agreement to this Privacy Notice

By using our Offerings and Websites, you are agreeing to our practices described in this Notice, this includes the collection and use of your personal information worldwide.

Your continued use of our Offerings and Websites following the posting of changes to this Privacy Notice will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.
