# Privacy Policy | Crossway.org

The following policy applies to usage of our website and orders placed thereon. For information about our “offline” privacy policy, please contact Customer Service.

Crossway respects your privacy. We do not sell or share your information with anyone else.

### What Information Do You Collect From Me?

We collect aggregate data—how many times a certain page is visited, for example, but we do not tie this data to your specific visit. We record search terms used so we can refine our search engine. We only collect personally identifiable information—your name, for example—when you sign up for an online account or newsletter, place an order, make a donation or contact us and provide this information.

We also use a technology called “cookies” for your convenience. This technology allows you to order more than once from us without having to re-enter all your information. You can turn off cookies by changing your browser’s preferences. We use session cookies to tie your browser to a specific session. You won’t be able to order from us online without allowing session cookies.

### With Whom Do You Share My Information?

Crossway respects your privacy. We do not sell or share your information with anyone else.

### What Will You Do With My Information?

If you place an order or give a donation, you will receive any necessary communication from us relating to the purchase or donation. We may also send you newsletters and updates via postal mail or email, should you decide to opt-in to receive this information.

### Changes to this policy

This policy was last updated February 2015. Any future changes to this policy will be posted on this page.
