 **Information we collect and how it is used ...**

When you connect to our web site, we are able to recognize the Internet (IP) address of the computer providing you with Internet access. Our use of this IP address may be to help diagnose problems with our server or otherwise administer our Web site. This IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information. Your IP address is never associated with you as an individual and never provided to another company or organization.

Our site writes a small data file called a cookie on your computer if you shop for products using the shopping cart or order dated or undated products. No personal information is placed in this file. The file is removed when you exit your browser.

We do not collect your name or email address, unless you provide it on a registration form, order form, survey form, or send us an email. Our site's forms may ask or require you to give us contact information (like your email address), financial information (like your account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like your zip code or age). We use this information to provide information, products, or services that you request. For example, financial information is used to bill you for products and services that you order. Any information collected is primarily for internal Crossmap use and is not made available to any outside group or organization except other agencies or companies working with Crossmap for designated purposes.

Our web site contains links to other sites. We cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of sites that do not belong to Crossmap.

**Policies for Children (Under the Age of 13)**

Crossmap encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the Crossmap web site. No personally identifiable information should be submitted to or posted at The Crossmap by visitors under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. 

This web site does not solicit or allow children under 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information. In the event that we ask for information online from children under the age of 13, we do not require personally identifiable information such as child's last name, city, or e-mail address. 

If our Crossmap staff receive e-mail from children under 13, we may contact the child under the following circumstances:  


  * **a)** to respond directly to the child's request on a one-time basis to a specific request from the child where it is not used to re-contact the child for other purposes, 
  * **b)** in order to request the name or online contact information of a parent for the sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification, and 
  * **c)** to respond more than once directly to a specific request from the child and not used to re-contact the child beyond the scope of that request (such as the case where a child requests a newsletter subscription). Where the information is used to contact the child more than once, The Crossmap uses reasonable efforts to provide parental notification. 



**Summary**

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders, to improve our web page and resource content, and to evaluate our resources with you.
