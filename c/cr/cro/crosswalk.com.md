**Privacy Statement for www.crosswalk.com**

DIDAX INC. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site; [http://www.crosswalk.com](http://www.crosswalk.com/) (formerly www.christcom.net).

DIDAX gathers two types of information: Registration data including demographic (zip code, age, or income level) and preference information, that users provide through an optional registration process, and usage information that is automatically provided by each user's browser for each page requested on our site (commonly referred to as web site log data).

**Registration Data**  
The registration data is analyzed and presented to advertisers only in an aggregate form. Individual data is shared with select partners who provide individualized services, such as CCNMAIL, to Crosswalk.com users. Crosswalk.com and said partners may only disclose to third parties certain aggregate information contained in Users' registration applications. Neither Crosswalk.com nor partners will disclose any individual User's name, address, e-mail address or telephone number without such User's prior consent, except to the extent necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws or in legal proceedings where such information is relevant.

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their email address and optionally their street address). If provided, we may use this contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company and occasional promotional material from our partners. Users may opt-out of receiving initial mailings at the time of registration or opt-out of future mailings; see the delete/deactivate section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the user's experience at our site, showing content that correlates with user's demographics or profile information, and displaying the content according to user's preferences. This information is shared with advertisers only on an aggregate basis.

**Log Data**  
We use users' current Internet Protocol (IP) addresses -- an address typically assigned to individual browsers by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) -- to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. We also collect and analyze refer data (information about the page you entered our site from) to better evaluate the sources of our user traffic. Log data is also analyzed to determine traffic patterns through our site. Overall statistics of browser-supplied information such as browser type and domain name are collected and analyzed in an aggregate manner.

**Contests**  
We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as an email address). We use contact data from our contests to communicate with users personally when necessary, to send users information about our company and to occasionally send users promotional material from our partners. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the delete/deactivate section below.

**Cookies**  
Our site uses cookies to keep track of a user's shopping cart -- a convenience feature for those users who choose to buy a product merchandised on our site -- and to make sure users don't see the same advertisements repeatedly. Cookies are also used to insure that only a single log-in for each visit to our site is necessary (and not all visits require a log-in) and to deliver interest-specific content providing for a personalized experience on certain pages of our site.

We use an outside ad placement company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by the ad company, and we do not have access to this information. We do not share information about individual users with these advertisers, and correlation between a specific user's response to a particular ad based on registration data is not possible.

**Opt-Out**  
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners at the point where we request information about the user. Users may opt out of various mailing lists that we provide by responding to the list with an unsubscribe request or in some cases, deactivating their name from the list via our member information page.

**Correcting and updating**  
User registration data can be corrected or updated by going to our members services area at [http://join.crosswalk.com](http://join.crosswalk.com/) and updating the appropriate information.

**Delete/Deactivate**  
To delete or deactivate an account, a user currently must send an email from the original email address that created the account to [registrar@crosswalk.com](mailto:registrar@crosswalk.com) and ask to be removed from our database. Alternatively, a user can simply change all information about themselves except their username, effectively eliminating their entry. 

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact us at
