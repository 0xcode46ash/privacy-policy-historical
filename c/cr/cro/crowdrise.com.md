# Privacy Policy | Charity Online Fundraising on Crowdrise

**Effective June 7, 2011; Version PP 1.4**

  1. OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY 

Crowdrise, LLC is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. Crowdrise has developed this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to ensure your personal information is protected. The Privacy Policy discloses the information we gather on www.crowdrise.com (the "Site"), as well as ways in which we process and, share such information and how you can correct or change such information. Except where otherwise expressly indicated herein or on the Site, this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on the Site and does not apply to information collected outside of the Site.

This Privacy Policy addresses our privacy practices relating to the general use of our Site by anyone who visits, browses or otherwise uses the Site (collectively, "You"). Before submitting information to the Site, please read this Privacy Policy. By visiting the Site, submitting information, making a donation or using any of our products or services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy and consent to having your data transferred to and/or processed in the United States. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.

  2. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT 

Crowdrise is all about Volunteers and Fundraisers answering the call to service, raising money for Charity and having the most fun in the world while doing it. The Site is intended to provide this great experience without requiring you to submit any more Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") than is necessary to use the Site effectively. We do not require you to register or submit PII in order to visit the Site. Some activities on the Site can be performed without providing PII. When we ask for PII to, for instance, participate in an activity, set up an account or project page or make a donation, we will not require anyone to disclose more PII than we believe is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. We collect the following categories of information from you:

    1. Personally Identifiable Information Collected from Individuals 

We may receive and store any information you enter on the Site or provide to us in any other way through or via the Site that would allow us to identify you personally or contact you. The PII you provide to us only will be used by Crowdrise in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Examples of PII we may collect from you:

      * If you set up a personal account, we collect your name, email address and birthday and, if you choose, your sex, any photos that you upload to the Site, your mailing address and phone number;
      * PII you provide about yourself when you send us an e-mail or [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/about/contact).
      * PII you provide about yourself on your account page, a project page or anywhere else on the Site. For example, if you use any third party platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter, to share information about yourself on the Site, we collect that information.

You can choose not to provide us with certain PII, but then you may not be able to take advantage of all of the services and products offered on the Site.

    2. Personally Identifiable Information Collected from Charities 

If you are a charity or nonprofit (each a "Charity") and you establish an account with Crowdrise, we will collect the name, email address, birthday and phone number of the person who establishes a Charity account and claims your Charity (the "Charity Contact"). We also may collect, if the Charity Contact chooses to provide it, the Charity Contact's sex, or any photos uploaded to the Site.

    3. Passive Gathering of Information Electronically 
      1. Cookies 

During the course of any visit to the Site, the pages you see, along with something called "cookies," are downloaded to your computer. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. These cookies do not contain or collect any PII, but they do enable us to provide features such as personalization. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you usually can change your browser to limit or prevent cookies. Cookies in themselves do not personally identify the individual user, but rather the computer that is being used to access the Site. You may have the opportunity to set your computer to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. Different browsers may address cookies differently. If you set your browser to not accept cookies, it may result in certain personalized services not being provided to you when you use that computer.

      2. Web Beacons 

A web beacon is a transparent image file. Web beacons enable Crowdrise to track website usage information, such as the number of times a given web page has been viewed. Web beacons are invisible to you and (unlike cookies) are not placed on your computer. They may be used in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the pages and content on the pages of the Site.

Web beacons also may be used to track whether you have opened an HTML email. When the email is opened, a part of the code that makes up the HTML page calls a web server to load the web beacon which then generates a record showing that the email has been viewed. Web Beacons may also recognize when the email was opened, how many times it was forwarded and which URL's (links within the email) were clicked.

Crowdrise does not use web beacons to collect or otherwise record any type of PII provided by or about any User.

    4. E-mail Communications to You and Your Friends 

When you send an e-mail to Crowdrise, we may retain your e-mail address and the contents of the e-mail you send.

When you invite friends to join Crowdrise, donate to one of your projects or join a team, Crowdrise will send an email to your friends. Crowdrise does not store your friends' email address or use that information for any purpose other than sending the email that you requested.

    5. Non Personally Identifiable Information 

From time to time, we may also ask you to provide us with non-PII which is data that is not intended to allow us to identify you personally, such as your first name, birthday or zip code. Your non-PII may be aggregated and used for our internal purposes or for creating reports for third-party advertisers and partners, or otherwise shared with third parties for any lawful purpose, without your permission. No third party is intended to be able to know who you are as a result of the use of your non-PII.

We also may automatically collect Site usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of users to the Site, pages visited and similar data. This data is used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that is intended to identify you personally. Aggregate information generally is collected through the use of cookies and web beacons as discussed above. This aggregate information helps Crowdrise determine general usage patterns and modify the Site in order to improve your experience. This type of aggregate information may be shared with third parties at any time.

  3. HOW WE USE INFORMATION 

When you provide us with your PII, we may use such information for a number of purposes, including:

    * To facilitate communication between Crowdrise and you including, without limitation, responding to your questions or comments, sending e-mails concerning our products and services, or to contact you for feedback regarding us, advertisers or business partners;
    * To administer your account, process donations, provide products or services to you and for Crowdrise marketing and promotional activities;
    * To provide a report to a Charity or an event supporting a Charity to whom you have made a donation or to alert a fundraiser to whom you have made a donation, supported a project or joined a team;
    * To provide a report to our advertisers or business partners that tells them who responded to a particular offer or to facilitate the fulfillment of an order that you have made with an advertiser or business partner;
    * To provide you with important functionality changes to the Site, new Crowdrise services and special offers from Crowdrise and reputable third parties that we think you will find valuable;
    * To customize, analyze, adjust and improve the Site to meet our your, advertisers' or business partners' needs and expectations;

  5. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES 

Crowdrise may give, share, sell or trade your PII to or with any third parties under the following circumstances: 

    1. Charities and Event Organizers 

When you make a donation or register to, volunteer, fundraise or register for an event for a Charity or for an organization or event associated with fundraising (e.g., a marathon, walk concert or similar), Crowdrise shares with the Charity and Event Organizer your name, address, email address, donation amount, date of transaction, transaction identification number and may also include the name of the project associated with the donation.
