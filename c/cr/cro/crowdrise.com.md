  1. Our Commitment to Privacy 

Crowdrise, LLC is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. Crowdrise has developed this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to ensure your personal information is protected. The Privacy Policy discloses the information we gather on www.crowdrise.com (the "Site"), as well as ways in which we process and, share such information and how you can correct or change such information. Except where otherwise expressly indicated herein or on the Site, this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on the Site and does not apply to information collected outside of the Site.

This Privacy Policy addresses our privacy practices relating to the general use of our Site by anyone who visits, browses or otherwise uses the Site (collectively, "You"). Before submitting information to the Site, please read this Privacy Policy. By visiting the Site, submitting information, making a donation or using any of our products or services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy and consent to having your data transferred to and processed in the United States. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.

  2. The Information We Collect 

Crowdrise is all about Volunteers and Fundraisers answering the call to service, raising money for Charity and having the most fun in the world while doing it. The Site is intended to provide this great experience without requiring you to submit any more Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") than is necessary to use the Site effectively. We do not require you to register or submit PII in order to visit the Site. Some activities on the Site can be performed without providing PII. When we ask for PII to, for instance, participate in an activity, set up an account or project page or make a donation, we will not require anyone to disclose more PII than we believe is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. We collect the following categories of information from you:

    1. Personally Identifiable Information Collected from Individuals 

We may receive and store any information you enter on the Site or provide to us in any other way through or via the Site that would allow us to identify you personally or contact you. The PII you provide to us only will be used by Crowdrise in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Examples of PII we may collect from you:

      * If you set up a personal account, we collect your name, email address and date of birth and, if you choose, your sex, any photos that upload to the Site, your mailing address and phone number;
      * PII you provide about yourself when you send us an e-mail or [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/about/contact).
      * PII you provide about yourself on your account page, a project page or anywhere else on the Site. For example, if you use any third party platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter, to share information about yourself on the Site, we collect that information.

You can choose not to provide us with certain PII, but then you may not be able to take advantage of all of the services and products offered on the Site.

    2. Personally Identifiable Information Collected from Charities 

If you are a charity or nonprofit (each a "Charity") and you establish an account with Crowdrise, we will collect the name, email address, date of birth and phone number of the person who establishes a Charity account and claims your Charity (the "Charity Contact"). We also may collect, if the Charity Contact chooses to provide it, his/her sex, or any photos uploaded to the Site.

    3. Passive Gathering of Information Electronically 
      1. Cookies 

During the course of any visit to the Site, the pages you see, along with something called "cookies," are downloaded to your computer. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. These cookies do not contain or collect any PII, but they do enable us to provide features such as personalization. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you usually can change your browser to limit or prevent cookies. Cookies in themselves do not personally identify the individual user, but rather the computer that is being used to access the Site. You may have the opportunity to set your computer to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. Different browsers may address cookies differently. If you set your browser to not accept cookies, it may result in certain personalized services not being provided to you of that computer.

      2. Web Beacons 

A web beacon is a transparent image file. Web beacons enable Crowdrise to track website usage information, such as the number of times a given web page has been viewed. Web beacons are invisible to you and (unlike cookies) are not placed on your computer. They may be used in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the pages and content on the pages of the Site.

Web beacons also may be used to track whether you have opened an HTML email. When the email is opened, a part of the code that makes up the HTML page calls a web server to load the web beacon which then generates a record showing that the email has been viewed. Web Beacons may also recognize when the email was opened, how many times it was forwarded and which URL's (links within the email) were clicked.

Crowdrise does not use web beacons to collect or otherwise record any type of PII provided by or about any User.

    4. E-mail Communications to You and Your Friends 

When you send an e-mail to Crowdrise, we may retain your e-mail address and the contents of the e-mail you send.

When you invite friends to join Crowdrise, donate to one of your projects or join a team, Crowdrise will send an email to your friends. Crowdrise does not store your friends' email address or use that information for any purpose other than sending the email that you requested.

    5. Non Personally Identifiable Information 

From time to time, we may also ask you to provide us with non-PII which is data that does not allow us to identify you personally, such as your first name, birth date or zip code. Your non-PII may be aggregated and used for our internal purposes or for creating reports for third-party advertisers and partners, or otherwise shared with third parties for any lawful purpose, without your permission. No third party will know who you are as a result of the use of your non-PII.

We also may automatically collect Site usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of users to the Site, pages visited and similar data. This data is used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Aggregate information generally is collected through the use of cookies and web beacons as discussed above. This aggregate information helps Crowdrise determine general usage patterns and modify the Site in order to improve your experience. This type of aggregate information may be shared with third parties at any time.

  3. How We Use Information 

When you provide us with your PII, we may use such information for a number of purposes, including:

    * To facilitate communication between Crowdrise and you including, without limitation, responding to your questions or comments, sending e-mails concerning our products and services, or to contact you for feedback regarding us, advertisers or business partners;
    * To provide a report to a Charity to whom you have made a donation or to alert a fundraiser to whom you have made a donation, supported a project or joined a team;
    * To provide a report to our advertisers or business partners that tells them who responded to a particular offer or to facilitate the fulfillment of an order that you have made with an advertiser or business partner;
    * To provide you with important functionality changes to the Site, new Crowdrise services and special offers from Crowdrise and reputable third parties that we think you will find valuable;
    * To customize, analyze, adjust and improve the Site to meet our your, advertisers' or business partners' needs and expectations;
    * To enforce our agreements with you, prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities, for other legally permissible purposes and generally to ensure that we comply with applicable laws;
    * To send emails to friends based on your instructions as discussed in E-mail Communications to You and Your Friends
  4. Accessing or Changing Your PII 

Crowdrise allows you to change or correct inaccuracies in your PII by logging into your account and making changes to your PII.

  5. Disclosure of Information To Third Parties 

Crowdrise may give, share, sell or trade your PII to or with any third parties under the following circumstances: 

    1. Charities 

When you make a donation or register to, volunteer, fundraise or register for an event for a Charity, Crowdrise shares with the Charity your name, address, email address, donation amount, date of transaction, transaction identification number and may also include the name of the project associated with the donation. If you wish to stop receiving communications from a Charity, please contact it directly.

    2. Fulfillment of Services 

We may retain other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include, but are not limited to, companies that help to administer the Crowdrise accounts, surveys or promotional activities, shipping companies that deliver products, third party advertisers or promotional partners who provide a product or service to you, customer support specialists, web hosting and internet service companies, and data analysis firms. Such third parties may be provided with access to PII needed to perform their functions but may not use such information for any other purpose.

    3. Compliance with Law and Fraud Protection 

We may disclose any information, including, without limitation, PII, that we deem necessary, in our sole discretion and without your prior permission, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. We may also exchange information, including, without limitation, PII, with other companies and organizations for credit fraud protection, risk reduction and related activities or to protect the rights, property of safety of Crowdrise, its agents, employees or affiliates or others. Crowdrise reserves the right to disclose PII for a user who we believe is in violation of our Privacy Policy or other terms of service as posted on the Site, even without a subpoena, warrant, court order or other governmental request.

    4. Sale or Transfer of Information 

In the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, dissolution or sale or transfer of substantially all of the assets of Crowdrise or the Site, PII and/or other information collected about you from the Site may be sold, assigned or transferred to the party acquiring all or substantially all of the equity and/or assets of Crowdrise or the Site in order to permit the party to continue the operation of Crowdrise and/or the Site or any successor version of the Site. You consent to the sale and transfer of your information as described in this paragraph.

  6. Credit Card Information 

Crowdrise does not collect, store or otherwise maintain any credit card information from individuals who make a donation through the Site. Crowdrise uses Amazon Paymentsâ¢ to provide a trusted third-party payment platform for you to make donations to the Charity of your choice. When you make a donation on the Site, you will be directed to the Amazon Paymentsâ¢ website to complete your donation. Amazon Payments, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Amazon.com that provides a safe means to process transactions online. [Amazon Paymentsâ¢](https://web.archive.org/about/terms#amazon) is not affiliated with Crowdrise.

  7. Important Disclosures, Practices and Contact Information 
    1. Third Party Links 

The Site may contain links to third-party websites. Please be aware that Crowdrise cannot control and is not responsible for the information collection practices of such websites, which may differ from those of Crowdrise. We encourage you to review and understand the privacy policies of these web sites before providing any information to them.

    2. Data Security 

We maintain a variety of commercially reasonable safeguards designed to protect your PII from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, we use industry accepted tools and techniques to protect against unauthorized access to our systems.

You should be aware, however, that Crowdrise has no control over the security of other websites on the Internet that you might visit even when a link may appear to those websites from our Site. If you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public, remember to sign off and close your browser window when you have finished your session. This will help to ensure that others cannot access your PII.

We want you to feel confident using the Site. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take commercially reasonable steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your PII, searches or other communications always will remain secure. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your PII, we will notify you if reasonably possible and as reasonably necessary so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address(es) we have on record for you. You should also take care with how they handle and disclose their PII. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's Web site at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
