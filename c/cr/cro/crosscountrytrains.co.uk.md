[Home](https://web.archive.org/) / Privacy policy 

## At CrossCountry, we're committed to protecting and respecting your privacy..

This policy outlines the personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us and how we will process it. Please read it carefully as it should help you understand how we collect and use your personal information.

\- We may also collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type for system administration, to improve the structure and content of our site and to report aggregated information to our advertisers and marketing agencies. This is statistical data about your browsing actions and patterns which in turn enables us to track the performance of our site and advertising efforts.

For this reason, we may collect this information even if you do not register with us on our website.

## Cookies

To enable us to collect the information mentioned above, we may use cookies which is an anonymous method of recording information. Cookies also provide functionality to our website such as remembering 'Your recent searches' or 'Favourite journeys' so disabling them will impact these features.

By using this website, you are agreeing to our use of cookies, however you can adjust your browser (e.g Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) settings and control the creation and storage of cookies on your hard drive. The "Help" section in your browser should provide you with the necessary information to do this.

### What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small data file which is transferred to the cookie file of your web browser. Each browser saves its own cookies so if you visit our website on a Chrome browser and search for a journey and then later visit our site on the same computer but on a Firefox browser, this journey won't be remembered. If you go back to the Chrome browser, your recent searches will be remembered and displayed to you.

Cookies are harmless text files. They can't look into your computer or read any personal information or other material on your hard drive. Cookies can't carry viruses or install anything harmful on your computer.

### What cookies do we use?

There are two types of cookies we use on our site, session cookies and persistent cookies.

Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you close the browser. Persistent cookies which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).

Most major websites use cookies and as we mentioned above, cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you.

Session cookies allow us to carry information across pages of our site and avoid you having to re-enter information. They also allow you to access stored information - for instance if you search for a journey from Manchester Piccadilly to Birmingham on our homepage, a session cookie will remember this information when you click on the search button and we can then pass it through to our booking pages. 

Persistent cookies help us recognise you as a unique visitor (but just as a number) when you return to our website and to allow us to tailor content or advertisements to match your preferred interests. An example of a persistent cookie is when you opt for our site to remember your login details. The persistent cookie would be used to store your email address so you don't have to enter it in every time.

If you alter your browser settings to refuse our cookies you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you first visit our site.

Our website may contain electronic images known as web beacons which allow us to count users who have visited those pages. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information on our site. They are a technique to compile aggregated statistics about our website's usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.

### Where do we store your personal data?

The data that we collect from you is stored on our secure UK servers however our third party suppliers may have your information transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, providing of support and administration services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing of your information. These agents have access to the personal information required in order to perform their job but may not use it for any other purpose. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access

### Your rights

We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can always refuse this at any time by contacting us at [customer.relations@crosscountrytrains.co.uk](mailto:customer.relations@crosscountrytrains.co.uk)
