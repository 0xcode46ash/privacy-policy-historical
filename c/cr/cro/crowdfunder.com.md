We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of crowdfunder.com (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).

As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.  

We may share your personal information with business partners who assist us by performing services such as hosting, fulfillment, or data storage and security related to our operation of the Site. Those business partners have all agreed to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we’ve promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your information to carry out their specific business obligations to crowdfunder.

They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.  Some links are to service providers that we believe offer complementary services, and in some instances we may receive a commission for referrals. However, we do not control or take any responsibility for the actions of any such service providers, including without limitation if those service providers use your personal information in any inappropriate manner. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other websites.
