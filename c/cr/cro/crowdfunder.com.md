Thank you for visiting CrowdFunder.com (the "Site"). This Site is operated by Fairground Media LLC, located at 1701 Pearl Street, Suite 200, Boulder, Colorado 80302. Your access to and use of the Site is subject to the following Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") and all applicable laws. The terms "CrowdFunder," "we," "us" and "our" when used in this Privacy Policy mean Fairground Media LLC. The terms "you" and "your," when used in this Privacy Policy, mean any user of the Site.

We understand your concerns about privacy and we want to assure you that CrowdFunder takes privacy matters seriously. Therefore, we are providing this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy, you may direct them to [privacy@CrowdFunder.com](mailto:privacy@CrowdFunder.com). 

Important: by submitting information manually or in electronic form to us and/or by using the Site, you give your consent that all information that you submit may be processed by CrowdFunder in the manner and for the purposes described below. Do not send CrowdFunder any confidential or proprietary information other than as necessary to post your postings. 

**WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION DOES CrowdFunder COLLECT?**

We sometimes collect information about you in an effort to make our services more efficient and customized to you. You are free to browse the Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, once you give us your personally identifiable information (as further described below), you are not anonymous to us. We collect two types of information from visitors to the Site, "Automatic Anonymous Information" and "Personally Identifiable Information. We treat Automatic Anonymous Information and Personally Identifiable Information differently and the following sections describe both Automatic Anonymous Information and Personally Identifiable Information, and address how each type of information is collected and used by CrowdFunder. 

The Site may automatically track certain information based upon your behavior. This information does not identify you personally. We use this information to improve the content and functionality of the Site, and to better understand and serve our users. This information may include what browser you are using, your IP address, or other information.

Personally Identifiable Information is individually identifiable information about you that could permit one to identify or contact you. At various places on the Site, we may request certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as your name, phone number, e-mail, payment address and other personal information. You may choose to provide Personally Identifiable Information in order to access or use certain features or services of the Site, such as registering on the Site, filling out a survey or providing feedback. Where possible, we indicate which fields of information are required and which fields are optional. You can always choose not to provide information, but you may not be able to use a particular service or feature on the Site.

**OUR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We use Automatic Anonymous Information to collect from you for specific and limited purposes, including improving our services and providing you with a personalized service. We may also use your Automatic Anonymous Information internally to administer the Site. 

When you create a posting, we will ask you for certain Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, address and/or e-mail address in order to administer the posting, to send you promotional e-mails and notify you with respect to your fundraising goal. Your consent to such use and disclosure of this information is a condition of your participation. 

If you provide us with your e-mail address as part of a posting or if you opt-in to receive communications from CrowdFunder, we may periodically send you newsletters, e-mails featuring exclusive sales and promotions, and e-mails requesting your feedback on our products and services. In addition, if you make a donation via the Site, we will send you confirmation e-mails. You can remove your e-mail from our e-mail list at any time by visiting the "Accessing and Updating Your Information" section below to change your preferences, or clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in every CrowdFunder e-mail.

**DOES CrowdFunder SHARE THE INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?**

CrowdFunder may share your Personally Identifiable Information: (i) with third parties who are under obligations of confidentiality with CrowdFunder or with CrowdFunder's affiliates or subsidiaries, (ii) if CrowdFunder is required by law to do so, (iii) in the event of a transfer of ownership of CrowdFunder, merger or other similar transaction, or (iv) as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. The following describes some of the ways that your Personally Identifiable Information may be disclosed to third parties: 

We may employ other third parties to perform services or functions on our behalf in order to improve the Site, merchandising, marketing and promotional efforts, communications or other services. Those third parties may include authorized contractors, consultants and other companies working with us (collectively, "agents"). They only have access to Personally Identifiable Information needed to perform their functions, and they may not share any Personally Identifiable Information with others or use it for any other purpose than providing or improving CrowdFunder's services and offerings. 

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site and does not address the practices of third parties who may collect your Personally Identifiable Information. You may visit other Web sites, through links on the Site, which may collect, use and share your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with their own privacy policies. The information practices of those Web sites linking from or to the Site are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we encourage you to be very cautious before you disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to others. In order to provide you with the information or products or services which you have requested, we may share or transfer your Personally Identifiable Information with our affiliates. 

CrowdFunder may be obligated to cooperate with various law enforcement inquiries. CrowdFunder reserves the right to share or transfer Personally Identifiable Information to comply with a legal requirement, disclose any activities or Personally Identifiable Information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, determine necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, for the administration of justice, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.

**ACCESSING AND UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION**

You always have the opportunity to review and change the information you provide to us by logging into the Site and entering in the new information yourself. You can edit your name, contact information and preferences by logging into the "My Account" section of the Site. 

You may ask to have your account information removed from our active databases; however, because we keep track of past purchases, we cannot delete information associated with past purchases. Also, as a security measure we "back up" the data stored on our systems, and such prior information cannot be completely removed from our databases. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your Personally Identifiable Information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. 

**A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

You must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use the Site. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose Personally Identifiable Information about visitors under 18 years of age. If you are under the age of 18, you can use this service only in conjunction with your parent's or guardian's permission. 

**PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES**

CrowdFunder reserves the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted in this document and will become effective immediately upon being posted unless we tell you otherwise. 

**GOVERNING LAW**

This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms of Use and as such shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado in the United States of America without regard to conflicts of a law principles. You hereby consent and waive all objection to jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of the state Colorado and to venue therein.

Further, you hereby waive trial by jury in any action or proceeding brought by either party to enforce or defend the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
