# Privacy Policy - Crochetville

**PRIVACY POLICY EFFECTIVE 11/20/09**

Your personal privacy is very important to us at Crochetville. We do not sell, rent, give, or otherwise divulge your personally-identifiable information (PII) to other parties outside of Crochetville administrative staff. Please read our privacy policy for more information on how we use and protect your personal information. We want you to have a clear understanding of our privacy policy.

The Crochetville forum software collects personal information to provide you with an efficient, enjoyable, and customized forum experience. The only personal information we collect is what is necessary to achieve this purpose.

Any non-registered member is able to browse the majority of the Crochetville forum site (with the exception of several members-only folders) with anonymity: you do not need to tell us who you are or give us any personally-identifiable information about yourself. Once you register an account on Crochetville, you are no longer anonymous to the administrative staff. 

When you register an account with Crochetville, you are first required to enter a birthdate (to comply with internet safety laws that prevent children from signing up for forums without a parent's permission). You are also required to provide us with a valid, working email address. While you are an active member at Crochetville, you must keep a valid, working email address on file with your account in case we ever need to contact you (and so that you will receive email notifications of Private Messages and posts in threads to which you have subscribed). Your IP address is also logged whenever you register and subsequently post to the forum. This is the only personally-identifiable information that is required to register an account.

Once you have registered an account, you may choose (at your own discretion) to enter other personal information in your profile that can be viewed by other Crochetville members. (Only registered members can view another member's profile information.)

Crochetville's vBulletin forum software also uses cookies to help personalize your forum experience by keeping track of which messages you have read, your Private Messages, threads to which you have subscribed, and so on. We also use cookies to enable you to enter your password only once during a session (if you click the "Remember Me" button when logging in).

Personal information stored on your computer cannot be collected via cookies. However, personal information you may have provided to this site may be tied to cookies.

Crochetville respects your privacy and will not share your personally identifiable information collected at this site with third parties except for the following limited circumstances: (1) you have given us your consent to share the information; (2) we need to seek the assistance of the abuse department at your ISP [any IP address you've used to connect to Crochetville] to stop disruptions you are causing to our forum, (3) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process including in the event of a complaint or legal action arising from any message posted by you; and (4) we believe the health or well-being of you or another member is threatened.
