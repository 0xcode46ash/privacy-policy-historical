USE AND DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH INFORMATION
           Crossroads Hospice (“Hospice”) may use your health information, information that constitutes Protected Health Information (“PHI”) as defined in the
Privacy Rule of the Administrative Simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, for purposes of providing you
treatment, obtaining payment for your care and conducting health care operations. PHI means any information about you that identifies you or for which there
is a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify you. The Hospice has established policies to guard against unnecessary disclosure of
your health information.
           THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH AND PURPOSES FOR WHICH YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION
MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED:
           To Provide Treatment. The Hospice may use your health information to coordinate care within the Hospice and with others involved in your care,
such as your attending physician, members of the Hospice interdisciplinary team and other health care professionals who have agreed to assist the Hospice in
coordinating care. For example, physicians involved in your care will need information about your symptoms in order to prescribe appropriate medications.
The Hospice also may disclose your health care information to individuals outside of the Hospice involved in your care including family members (unless you
ask us not to), pharmacists, suppliers of medical equipment or other health care professionals.
           To Obtain Payment. The Hospice may include your health information in invoices to collect payment from third parties for the care you receive from
the Hospice. For example, the Hospice may be required by your health insurer to provide information regarding your health care status so that the insurer will
reimburse you or the Hospice. The Hospice also may need to obtain prior approval from your insurer and may need to explain to the insurer your need for
hospice and the services that will be provided to you.
           To Conduct Health Care Operations. The Hospice may use and disclose health information for its own operations in order to facilitate the function
of the Hospice and as necessary to provide quality care to all of the Hospice’s patients. Health care operations include such activities as:

           ·          Activities designed to improve health or reduce health care costs.
           ·          Protocol development, case management and care coordination.
           ·          Contacting health care providers and patients with information about treatment alternatives and other related functions that do not include
                      treatment.
           ·          Professional review and performance evaluation.
           ·          Training programs including those in which students, trainees or practitioners in health care learn under supervision.
           ·          Training of non-health care professionals.
           ·          Accreditation, certification, licensing or credentialing activities.

           ·          Business management and general administrative activities of the Hospice.

patients in evaluating how to more effectively serve all Hospice patients, disclose your health information to Hospice staff and contracted personnel for training
purposes, use your health information to contact you as a reminder regarding a visit to you, or contact you for community information mailings (unless you tell
us you do not want to be contacted).
