#### 1\. What Information Do We Collect?

We collect two types of information about our Site Users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

**_Personally Identifiable Information._** Personally Identifiable Information is information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone number, or email address. As you engage in certain activities on the Site, we may ask you to provide information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in such activities.

**_Non-Personally Identifiable Information._** Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific User. Our Site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" to collect information about how our Site is used and certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information (see Item 6 of this Privacy Policy for more information regarding “cookies”). The Non-Personally Identifiable Information gathered by the Site may include your Internet service provider, browser type, operating system, the date and time of visits, the Site pages viewed, time spent at our Site, and the sites visited just before and just after our Site. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is collected on an aggregate basis without any association to your personal information so that you remain anonymous.

#### 2\. How Do We Use Personally Identifiable Information and When May Personally Identifiable Information be Released?

We use Personally Identifiable Information collected on the Site to enhance the operation of the Site, provide you with products and services, run sweepstakes and contests, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Site use, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third parties. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to enforce our agreements with you (including our Site Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy), troubleshoot issues with the Site, resolve disputes, perform administrative tasks, contact you, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.

We provide some products or services jointly with particular restaurants (“Affiliated Restaurants”) or particular retail merchants (“Affiliated Businesses”). We share some of your Personally Identifiable Information with Affiliated Restaurants and Affiliated Businesses in order to help them provide you with better service and track the value of our program. Sharing this Information will allow Affiliated Restaurants and Affiliated Businesses to market directly to you should they choose to do so. However, we will only share your Personally Identifiable Information with Affiliated Restaurants and Affiliated Businesses if you actively provide such information to us regarding such Affiliated Restaurants or Affiliated Businesses.

We provide some of our services and products through third parties (“Third Party Service Providers”). Third Party Service Providers perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing our administrative and promotional emails. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with these Third Party Service Providers to provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit card payments, operate the Site, troubleshoot, provide customer service, fill and ship orders, deliver packages, send postal or email, run contests or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on customer lists, and analyze data. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies with whom we have business relationships (“Affiliates”) and may share such information with Third Party Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks.

If we merge with or are acquired by another company, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.

We may also use or disclose Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes or investigate problems. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or a court order; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Site Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Site, its Users or others.

#### 3\. How Do We Use Non-Personally Identifiable Information and When May Non-Personally Identifiable Information be Released?

We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot and administer the Site, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. **We may also disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with our Affiliated Restaurants, Affiliated Business, advertisers, Affiliates, and Third Party Service Providers for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements, improving our Site, and for market research analysis on our Site and other sites.**

We use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer our Site and constantly improve its quality. We also use “Third Party Advertising Companies” to serve ads when you visit our Site. These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits to this Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. We may also publish Non-Personally Identifiable Information for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for advertisers. Please note that this is not Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries of the activities of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by us.

#### 4\. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information.

**As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although it may be required to engage in a certain activity on the Site.** As a condition of purchase of our products and services, we require your permission to send you Administrative and Promotional emails. You may choose whether or not you would like to receive Promotional Emails, however you may not opt-out of Administrative Emails.

“Administrative Emails” relate to a User’s activity on the Site, and include emails regarding a particular User’s account, requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and services.

“Promotional Emails” advertise our products and services, including exclusive sales and other offers, and/or the products and services of our Affiliated Restaurants, Affiliated Businesses, advertisers and Affiliates. Promotional Emails are sent to Users who register with us and have not opted-out of receiving Promotional Emails. If you do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect to opt-out of receiving Promotional Emails at any time after registering by writing to us at the address contained herein, or by hitting the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of any of our e-mails. When contacting us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and what Promotional Emails you do not want to receive.
