## We Think This Is Personal Information

In this Privacy Policy, we use the term "Personal Information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. Non-personally identifiable information is information about users that no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user.

## PCI Security At Its Finest

We transmit and store cardholder data under the most stringent credit card security standard: PCI Compliance Level 1. A PCI-certified auditor verified and awarded us this level of security and compliance.

## Keeping It On The Hush

We want to keep your personal information on the hush. We and our cloud provider protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. Some of the safeguards leveraged are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to the data centers, and information access authorization controls. 

To process your contributions to a Campaign, we may share some of your personal information with the Campaign Admin, including a Political Campaign Admin, or with other people who contributed to the Campaign, such as your name or the amount you contributed. We also may share your personal information with our payments processor, so that we can receive and disburse money related to Campaigns. Such information may include your name, and when you contributed, as well as the contribution amount, the card number, or other bank-related information. 

Additionally, we may share your personal information with:

  * Banking partners as required by credit card association rules for inclusion on their list of terminated merchants (in the event that you meet their criteria,) which includes having Crowdtilt close your Crowdtilt account due to your breaching the Crowdtilt Terms of Use. 
  * Affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process personal information for us, or help with our business operations, such as for marketing, fraud prevention, compliance, and technology services, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
  * Credit bureaus and collection agencies to report account information, as permitted by law. 
  * Companies, organizations or individuals outside of Crowdtilt if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; to enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations; to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Crowdtilt, our users or the public as required or permitted by law, i.e. to comply with a subpoena.
  * Companies we plan to merge with or to be acquired by. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.

Crowdtilt will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes.

If you open a Crowdtilt account directly on a third-party website or via a third-party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on a Crowdtilt website) may be shared with the owner of the third-party website or application. These sites are governed by their own privacy policies and you are encouraged to review their privacy policies before providing them with personal information. Crowdtilt is not responsible for the conduct or information practices of such third parties. If you purchase goods or services through a third party on that third-party platform or on the Services using your Crowdtilt account information, we may share your personal information related to your purchase with that third party. Such personal information may include your name, email address, and transaction information (item, amount, time, etc.) However, we will not disclose your charge card number or bank account number to anyone you have paid or who has paid you using the Services, except with your express permission.

We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners, including publishers, advertisers, or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of the Services. 

## Talk To Me Maybe

Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.

Crowdtilt does not share your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes unless you have given us your explicit consent. 

When you contribute to a nonprofit related campaign, we give you the option to share your information with that nonprofit (for instance, your name, email address, and contribution-related information.) We do not share your information with nonprofits as a result of these campaigns by default. However, when you make a single donation over $250 to a verified nonprofit, we share your information with that nonprofit for the purpose of their sending you a tax-deductible receipt.
