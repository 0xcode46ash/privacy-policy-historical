# Your privacy matters - Crowdin.net

**Updated on: November 28, 2009**

We have a pretty simple privacy policy. Here are some details on how your personal information will be handled by Crowdin.net

 **What Information Crowdin.net Collects**  


Crowdin.net may collect two types of information from users: "personally identifiable information" (such as name and email address) and "aggregate information" (such as frequency of visits to Site, IP address, Site pages most frequently accessed, browser type). Personally identifiable information is any piece of information which can potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a user. Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about users of the Site. Aggregate information is used in a collective manner and no single person can be identified by that compiled information. 

**How Crowdin.net Uses the Information Collected**

Crowdin.net may use the personally identifiable information a user submits for any purposes related to Crowdin.net business, including, but not limited to: 

  * To understand a userâ€™s needs and create content that is relevant to the user; 
  * To generate statistical studies; 
  * To conduct market research and planning by sending user surveys; 
  * To improve services, information, and products; 
  * To help a user complete a transaction, or provide services or customer support; 
  * To communicate back to the user; 
  * To update the user on services, information, and products; 
  * To personalize a Site for the user; 
  * To notify the user of any changes with a Site which may affect the user; 
  * To enforce terms of use on a Site; and 
  * To allow the user to access services or otherwise engage in activities the user selects. 



**Sharing Your Personal Information**

Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information outside of Crowdin.net and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent.

 **Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We will occasionally update this privacy policy to reflect changes in our service and customer feedback. When we post changes to this Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of it. If there are material changes to this statement or in how Crowdin.net will use your personal information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how Crowdin.net is protecting your information.

 **Notice**

Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to use our service and must not attempt to register with us and/or submit any personal information to us. Young people between 13 and 17 should not send any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet (including to us) without asking their parents/legal guardians for permission beforehand
