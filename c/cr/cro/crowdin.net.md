# Your privacy matters - Crowdin

We have a pretty simple privacy policy. Here are some details on how your personal information will be handled by Crowdin.net

#### What Information Crowdin.net Collects

Crowdin.net may collect two types of information from users: "personally identifiable information" (such as name and email address) and "aggregate information" (such as frequency of visits to Site, IP address, Site pages most frequently accessed, browser type). Personally identifiable information is any piece of information which can potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a user. Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about users of the Site. Aggregate information is used in a collective manner and no single person can be identified by that compiled information. 

#### How Crowdin.net Uses the Information Collected

Crowdin.net may use the personally identifiable information a user submits for any purposes related to Crowdin.net business, including, but not limited to: 

  * To understand the user's needs and create content that is relevant to the user; 
  * To generate statistical studies; 
  * To conduct market research and planning by sending user surveys; 
  * To improve services, information, and products; 
  * To help a user complete a transaction, or provide services or customer support; 
  * To communicate back to the user; 
  * To update the user on services, information, and products; 
  * To personalize the Site for the user; 
  * To notify the user of any changes with the Site which may affect the user; 
  * To enforce terms of use on a Site; and 
  * To allow the user to access services or otherwise engage in activities the user selects. 



#### Sharing Your Personal Information

Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information outside of Crowdin.net and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. 

#### Changes to the Privacy Policy

We will occasionally update the privacy policy to reflect customers' feedback and changes in our service. When we will post changes to the Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of it. In case of any changes we will notify you either by posting a prominent notice of changes prior to their implementation or by sending you a notificationÂ directly. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be informed about how Crowdin.net is protecting your information.
