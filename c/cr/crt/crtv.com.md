The Company respects your privacy and works hard to safeguard the privacy of your personal data. We realize that today’s Internet visitor has questions concerning the nature, use and confidentiality of information collected about consumers. We want you to know that we give our commitment to safeguarding privacy to your online and Internet activities with us. By continuing to access or use the Site, or by placing product orders on the Site, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy, and you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

The Company does not share, disclose or sell any personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) collected online on the Site with other unaffiliated companies or organizations for non-Company marketing purposes. Because this information is a critical part of our business, it would be treated like our other assets in the context of a merger, sale or other corporate reorganization or legal proceeding.

  **How We Use Information**  
The Company uses the personally identifiable information you give us to provide you with our service(s) and product(s) and to let you know about other offerings, which may be of interest to you. Postal and e-mail address information you provide, for example, enables communication about services offered and ordered. Because the Company works with a wide variety of companies, we may use information collected online to extend special offers to you jointly with our partners. If you have received a promotion from us and wish to opt out of receiving future promotions, please click on the “Unsubscribe” link included in the email you received.

  The Company uses vendors to carry out certain functions in marketing and delivering services to you, and so shares online data with those vendors to the extent necessary for them to perform their work. Of course, such partners and vendors must use that personally identifiable information only for the purpose(s) for which it was shared and protect it from any further use. the Company also shares such information with other industry and credit-related organizations to improve operations and to protect against fraud, security and credit risks.

  We also provide personally identifiable online information in response to subpoenas and other legal demands, and where we believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against individuals who may be endangering public safety or interfering with the Company property or services, or with our customers’ or others’ use of them. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

  **How We Collect Information**  
The Company collects information online by asking you for it. A customer’s name, address (postal and e-mail) and telephone number are the most important pieces of information, but we might request other information, based on, for example, the service(s) being ordered or promoted.

  The Company may also use “cookies” and similar technology to obtain information about your visits to our sites or our responses to e-mail from us—both individually and in aggregated data that does not identify you. These reporting tools tell us the parts of our web sites or e-mails in which you showed an interest or took some action, and help us improve the quality and usefulness of our sites. At the Company, we primarily use cookies to determine what services or promotions you are interested in. While cookies help us improve your experience while visiting our sites and customize our communications to the services you may desire, you have the option to block them through your Internet browser or other commercially available software. However, doing so may make some of our sites’ features unavailable to you.
