## OUR TRACKING ACTIVITIES AND YOUR CHOICES

We - or third parties - use browser cookies, web beacons, and Flash cookies. We use these methods to limit multiple responses and registrations, for market research analysis, to facilitate your ability to navigate the Sites, and as part of a verification or screening process. Information collected may be linked to your personal information, and may be shared with third parties for the reasons described in this policy.

You can control browser cookies by modifying your settings in your browser. You can control Flash cookies (these are similar to traditional cookies, but reside in Adobe Flash Player rather than your browser and thus will not be affected by any browser setting changes you make) by going to <http://phtshp.us/edMmSQ> and following the instructions on that page.

Some parts of the Sites may not operate correctly if you disable cookies, and you may not be able to participate in projects or join panels, or take advantage of some of the Sites' features.

## SECURITY

We cannot guarantee, however, that the information we collect will remain secure. The Internet by its nature is a public medium, and we encourage you to use caution when disclosing information online.
