# Privacy Policy | Cradlepoint

This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding information we gather from you while you visit the Cradlepoint, Inc. U.S. Web site, cradlepoint.com, and information we gather from you while you use Cradlepoint products.

**The Information We Collect** For all visitors to cradlepoint.com and users of Cradlepoint products, Cradlepoint collects general data pertaining to such use, including, by way of example, visitor's IP address, device ID, operating system, browser type and version number and the Web pages viewed. This information is aggregated with all other visitor information.

**Use of the Information Collected** While the information we collect enables us to offer better service, we may use the data for other purposes. Cradlepoint may share any information it collects with other parties including its business partners, suppliers and financial institutions. Cradlepoint may also disclose information in response to subpoenas, governmental requests or other legal process or to otherwise protect Cradlepoint's legal or contractual obligations.

When you submit personal information to Cradlepoint through this site, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which Cradlepoint and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices including, without limitation, the United States. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transfer, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of Cradlepoint. Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.

**Your Choices with Respect to Personal Information** Cradlepoint recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on this site. Without your consent, Cradlepoint will not communicate any information to you regarding products, services, and special offers available from Cradlepoint, although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of the services on this site. Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, Cradlepoint will also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.

There are other instances in which Cradlepoint may divulge your personal information. At times we may be required by law, regulation or litigation to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that such disclosure should be made for reasons of national security, law enforcement or other issues of public importance.

**Protection of Your Personal Information** The personal information that you provide in connection with registering yourself as a user of Cradlepoint products or services or registering a Cradlepoint product is classified as Registration Information and is protected.
