Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Every single website you visit on the internet collects this same information.

Email addresses collected via our newsletter signup form are never sold or rented to third parties. We use Feedburner and MailChimp for our mailing systems and comply with the highest ethical email marketing standards and go above and beyond CAN-SPAM guidelines.
