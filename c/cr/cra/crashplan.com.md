## 7\. Customers

Code42 offers a wide variety of services and solutions to our customers ("Customers") that facilitate services including backing up and restoring files and copying backup archives to the public cloud or external hard drives for the purposes of allowing Customers to restore archives for individuals ("Data Subjects"). In some instances, Code42 may obtain access to personal data about a Data Subject in the course of providing the Products. In other specific instances, Code42 may also obtain access to data about our Customers’ end users who are using the Products on behalf of our Customer (“End Users”) in the course of providing support services to such Customer(s). Depending on the particular Customer and application at issue, such data also may include name, email address, Product system configuration, log files and other information, and any other information chosen by the Customer that resides on an End User device.

When we obtain access to personal data about Data Subjects or End Users, we are acting as a data processor on behalf of our Customers. We conduct such activities strictly in accordance with our Customers’ instructions and pursuant to our contractual arrangements. If you are an End User or Data Subject of one of our Customers, you should refer to that Customers’ website to understand the privacy practices that apply to your personal data.

## 10\. Other Necessary Disclosures

Code42 may sell, transfer, or disclose personal data to business partners as appropriate in accordance with the terms of negotiated agreements for legitimate business purposes. In addition, Code42 may sell, transfer, or disclose personal data to our service providers under negotiated contracts as needed for such service providers to perform services on behalf of Code42. Our business partners and service providers may only use your personal data for the purpose and to fulfill our obligations with the contract terms we have in place with you. Service providers and business partners may not use personal data for any other purposes. If Code42 has knowledge that a business partner or service provider to which it has disclosed your personal data is processing your personal data in a way that is contrary to this Privacy Statement, Code42 will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing. In such case, the service provider or business partner is liable for damages unless it is proven that Code42 is responsible for the event giving rise to the violation.

Code42 may also sell, transfer, or disclose personal data as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of our business. Once information about such a sale or transfer may be shared publicly, Code42 will inform you of the sale, transfer or disclosure of your personal data by a prominent notice on our website(s) and that notice will include information about the handling of your personal data. In the event of a sale, transfer, or disclosure, Code42 will require the recipient of the personal data to protect such data in accordance with applicable law, including the Privacy Shield, and/or otherwise take steps to ensure that personal data is appropriately protected.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
