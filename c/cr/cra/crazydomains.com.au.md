Our website may track user access sessions using cookies, without your specific knowledge or participation, by automated means in the course of your use of our network. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies are used in one of two ways on our website: to track page views and user interactions for the purposes of improving our website for all customers; to track one time events when a user is not logged in so that if the user closes a notification, they will not be presented with it again if they return to the site. Cookies are a Web browser technology that is used to improve your experience of using our website, but are not used to record any personal information.

We do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information for the purposes of logging site actions (updating information, buying products etc) so that in the event of a bug or a dispute we can review the actions taken that led to the outcome and attempt to reproduce the issues.
