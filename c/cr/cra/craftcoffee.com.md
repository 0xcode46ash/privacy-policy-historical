## Information Sharing and Disclosure

CraftCoffee may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the CraftCoffee Terms of Use. CraftCoffee may disclose personally identifiable information to parties in compliance with CraftCoffee's Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy, as CraftCoffee in CraftCoffee's sole discretion believes necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, CraftCoffee may disclose name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email address and company name.

CraftCoffee is affiliated with a variety of businesses and works closely with them. These businesses may operate stores on the CraftCoffee website or sell items to you from the CraftCoffee website. CraftCoffee may also provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. Due to the nature of CraftCoffee's business model, when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, you will share customer information that is related to such transaction with that affiliated business.

CraftCoffee employs other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and needs to share your information with them to provide products and services to you. Examples could include but are not limited to fulfilling orders, handling billing disputes, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service.

CraftCoffee will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with nonaffiliated parties except as specified in this Privacy Policy to provide products or services you have requested or when CraftCoffee has your permission. It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of CraftCoffee's Terms of Use, as specified in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by law. In some cases, CraftCoffee may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. CraftCoffee will transfer information about you if CraftCoffee is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, CraftCoffee will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the CraftCoffee web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

As part of the buying and selling process, you may obtain another CraftCoffee user's email address, shipping address and/or other information. Pursuant to CraftCoffee's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use this information. This information should be used for only CraftCoffee-related communications or for CraftCoffee-facilitated transactions. CraftCoffee has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages. Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any CraftCoffee user to your email or physical mail list.
