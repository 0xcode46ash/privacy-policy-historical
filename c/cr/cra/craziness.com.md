# Incka Media

At Incka Limited the privacy of visitors to our sites is of prime importance. Our company feels privacy is being curved by many governments and companies, and we want to set an example of how companies should regard privacy issues. 

Firstly, our sites only collect personal information from users in opt-in methods, such as forums and newsletters. We never collect personal information in any way the user does not know about and users can enjoy our sites without having to supply personal information of any kind. 

Our sites do collect broad statistics of their users, but do not have individual records for each visitor. Statistical information collected include the number of visits, the number of pages viewed, IP addresses, countries of user's ISPs, etc. 

Any independent advertisers or advertising networks on our sites may have different policies and we suggest you read their privacy policies.
