# Privacy Policy

At Crabtree & Evelyn we understand and respect your concerns about privacy and security when shopping online. We are committed to maintaining and using your information responsibly. We collect information for one reason - to help serve you better.

**W **hat information is collected?****

When you make a purchase, we collect your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information. For your convenience, we provide an ‘address book’ service to save you time at checkout. This means we will store your billing address and frequent shipping addresses for future use. However, for security reasons, we do not store your credit card information.

When you fill out a survey, enter a contest, sign up to receive information or ask to be on our e-mail distribution list, we collect your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number and birth month. We may also maintain a record of your purchases from crabtree-evelyn.com. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of thirteen. 

**How is my information used?**

The shipping and billing information you provide when you make a purchase allows us to process your order and answer questions about the status of your order.  When you fill out a customer survey online, we use the information you provide to learn more about our customers so we can continually improve our online store and your shopping experience. When you participate in a contest, sweepstakes or promotion online, Crabtree & Evelyn (and other participating companies, if any) may use the information you provide for such purposes as communicating with you about the event and notifying winners, even if you have chosen not to receive e-mail or mail from Crabtree & Evelyn prior to participating in the contest, sweepstakes or promotion. You may choose not to participate in contests, sweepstakes and promotions if you do not wish to receive information from Crabtree & Evelyn or other participating companies.

When you request that your name be added to our mailing list, we use the information that you provide to send you emails and mailings about our products, services and promotions.

**Will my information be shared with third parties?**  
Crabtree & Evelyn does not sell or rent any personal information about our customers to any third party.  We may share the name, address and/or e-mail address of those customers who have chosen to participate in a contest, sweepstakes, promotion or survey with reputable third parties for the purpose of implementing our event. Those third parties may provide services such as mailing information about the contest, sweepstakes, promotion or survey, managing customer information, providing customer service, fulfilling promotional obligations and notifying winners. We do not authorize those third parties to make any other use of your information or to send you unsolicited mail. We may also share the name, address and/or e-mail address of our customers who have requested that their names be added to our mailing list with reputable third parties who work with us to implement our mailing programs. Those third parties may provide services such as mailing information about our products and promotions, managing customer information, providing customer service and conducting market research. We do not authorize those third parties to make any other use of your information or to send you unsolicited mail.

With your prior consent, we may share names and addresses from our mailing list with carefully chosen marketing partners. We may also share aggregated statistical or demographic information with third parties in a manner that does not reveal our customers’ personal identity.
