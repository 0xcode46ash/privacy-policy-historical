CRAVE ONLINE MEDIA'S COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY

Crave Promotions -- We develop customized online promotional campaigns such as sweepstakes and other incentive--style marketing campaigns.

**How Crave Products and Services Enhance User Privacy and Protect the Property of Advertisers and Web Publishers**

Crave serves ads throughout our site and those of our partners. The cookies that are employed across our represented websites serve a quantitative function and are not designed to collect and store data profiles on users. They are used to:

Report to advertisers and Web site clients the estimated total reach of an ad campaign;  
Report the frequency with which an ad was shown to a user, and other measurement statistics;

Ensure that an advertisement displayed to a user corresponds to the correct click-through destination;

Deliver a series of advertisements in the proper sequence; 

Limit the number of times a browser is delivered the same advertisement;

Login registered Crave user accounts;

and Log anonymous visitors to our site for the purposes of identifying whether a visitor is a unique.

Crave does not use any of the data collected via cookies for purposes other than those described above, nor do we merge personally identifiable information with non--personally identifiable information, or otherwise parse, sort, gather, or aggregate user data for use elsewhere. Non--PII is collected by Crave through session cookies that terminate when the browser is closed.

Crave Online Media thus has no reason to offer users the choice to "opt--out" of anything that pertains to ad serving.

**What User Information Is Collected by Email and Promotions**

Crave Online Media collects two types personally identifiable information only through its Email and Promotions business lines.

**Personally Identifiable Information ("PII")**

PII is personal information classified as personal to the online consumer, such as name, address, phone number and email address. PII also includes other personal information such as birth--date, zip code, gender, or lifestyle information.

Crave's Email and Promotions divisions collect PII on an opt--in basis only. Crave Online Media will not collect any PII unless that user voluntarily provides it to us. If you do not want your personal information collected online, please do not submit it to surveys, promotions, sweepstakes, or subscriptions.PII is collected by Crave Online Media when online users respond to a survey and provide it, when they register for an email newsletter, register for a product or service online, or enter a sweepstakes promoted by Crave, its subsidiaries or its partners. Selected partners of Crave Online Media will share information with Crave Online Media about only their online consumers who have consented to the sharing of their information with third parties.

Furthermore, each individual in the Crave Email database has answered positively to an "opt in" question, or they have voluntarily filled out an Internet survey card to receive email solicitation about products of interest. Crave Online Media and its partners communicate with these users frequently to verify their "opt in" status. Crave Online Media also provides users with an explicit opportunity to opt--out every time an email promotion is sent.

In all instances, prior to providing PII information to Crave's Email or Promotions divisions, each online user is given meaningful notice regarding the collection practice and a choice regarding the dissemination of such information. All users are informed about how Crave Online Media and its partners may use such information, including whether it will be shared with marketing partners or combined with other information available to Crave. Users will always be offered the choice not to provide PII or not to have such PII shared with others. Crave Online Media will not share this PII information with any partner company if the user indicates on the registration form the preference to limit the use of such information.

Crave Online Media does not collect personal medical information or credit information, or information related to children, except in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
