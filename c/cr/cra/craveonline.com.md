# CRAVEONLINE: Privacy Policy

**CraveOnline's Commitment To Privacy**

This policy governs the domains craveonline.com and cravelyrics.com.  
If you catch one of our interns peeking in your windows, that's an entirely separate situation.  
That sort of thing would be handled by their parents. Or the authorities.

CraveOnline is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering consumer confidence in the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing. We invite all users to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/) with any questions or concerns.

CraveOnline Promotions: We develop customized online promotional campaigns such as sweepstakes and other incentive-style marketing campaigns.  
CraveOnline Mail: CraveOnline operates an e-mail newsletter that it sends to users that have registered to receive it.

**How CraveOnline Products and Services Enhance User Privacy and Protect the Property of Advertisers and Web Publishers**  


CraveOnline serves ads throughout our site and those of our partners. The cookies that are employed across our represented websites serve a quantitative function and are not designed to collect and store data profiles on users. They are used to:

• Report to advertisers and Web site clients the estimated total reach of an ad campaign;  
• Report the frequency with which an ad was shown to a user, and other measurement statistics;  
• Ensure that an advertisement displayed to a user corresponds to the correct click-through destination;  
• Deliver a series of advertisements in the proper sequence;   
• Limit the number of times a browser is delivered the same advertisement;  
• Login registered CraveOnline user accounts  
• Log anonymous visitors to our site for the purposes of identifying whether a visitor is a unique. 

Destruction timetable:  
user cookies ("users_uid") expire one year after the last time the user successfully logged in to their CraveOnline account.  
anonymous cookies ("tracking_anonid") expire 6 months from the date of the last visit to CraveOnline.

CraveOnline does not use any of the data collected via cookies for purposes other than those described above, nor do we merge personally identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information, or otherwise parse, sort, gather, or aggregate user data for use elsewhere. Non-PII is collected by CraveOnline through session cookies that terminate when the browser is closed.

CraveOnline Online Media thus has no reason to offer users the choice to "opt-out" of anything that pertains to ad serving.

**What User Information Is Collected by Email and Promotions**

CraveOnline Online Media collects two types personally identifiable information only through its Email and Promotions business lines.

**Personally Identifiable Information ("PII")**

PII is personal information classified as personal to the online consumer, such as name, address, phone number and email address. PII also includes other personal information such as birthdate, zip code, gender, or lifestyle information.

CraveOnline's Email and Promotions divisions collect PII on an opt-in basis only. CraveOnline Media will not collect any PII unless that user voluntarily provides it to us. If you do not want your personal information collected online, please do not submit it to surveys, promotions, sweepstakes, or subscriptions.PII is collected by CraveOnline Media when online users respond to a survey and provide it, when they register for an email newsletter, register for a product or service online, or enter a sweepstakes promoted by CraveOnline, its subsidiaries or its partners. Selected partners of CraveOnline Media will share information with CraveOnline Media about only their online consumers who have consented to the sharing of their information with third parties.

Furthermore, each individual in the CraveOnline Email database has answered positively to an "opt in" question, or they have voluntarily filled out an Internet survey card to receive email solicitation about products of interest. CraveOnline Media and its partners communicate with these users frequently to verify their "opt in" status. CraveOnline Media also provides users with an explicit opportunity to opt-out every time an email promotion is sent.

In all instances, prior to providing PII information to CraveOnline's Email or Promotions divisions, each online user is given meaningful notice regarding the collection practice and a choice regarding the dissemination of such information. All users are informed about how CraveOnline Media and its partners may use such information, including whether it will be shared with marketing partners or combined with other information available to CraveOnline. Users will always be offered the choice not to provide PII or not to have such PII shared with others. CraveOnline Media will not share this PII information with any partner company if the user indicates on the registration form the preference to limit the use of such information.

CraveOnline Media does not collect personal medical information or credit information, or information related to children, except in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

**How CraveOnline Media Uses Collected Information**

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is used by CraveOnline Media in several ways, as follows:

Promotions and Email divisions use the PII to deliver permission-based direct marketing messages based on a user's expressed interests.

If an online user voluntarily submits its email address to CraveOnline, or one of its partners, online, he or she may receive periodic emails from CraveOnline Media with information on new services or products being offered by our company or by one of our partners.

**With Whom Collected Information Is Shared**

CraveOnline Media shares the collected information only as set forth below. CraveOnline Media does not sell or transfer the ownership of its PII or Non-PII. CraveOnline Media provides its partners only with access to such information on a limited basis. Before any access is shared with a partner, CraveOnline Media ensures that such partner publishes and adheres to strict privacy principles regarding the use of such information. Any such use is disclosed to the online user at the time such user submits information.

Personally Identifiable Information (PII): in cases where an online consumer has consented to have their information shared with third parties, CraveOnline Media will make access to the information available to selected third party partners in accordance with clearly stated guidelines.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII): Access to Non-PII is shared, in aggregated format, with CraveOnline's Web site and advertiser clients who use the aggregated data to determine the reach, effectiveness, future campaign plans, and success of their advertising campaigns. At no time is this non-PII merged with PII. It is useless to any and all parties except as quantifiable data to our advertisers and clients who wish to measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.

Opting Out From GNM Promotions Database

An online user may request removal of his or her PII information from GNM's Promotions database by sending an email to [info@craveonline.com](mailto:info@craveonline.com).

12910 Culver Blvd Suite F  
Los Angeles, CA 90066

Once a request to opt-out has been received, CraveOnline Media will deliver a confirming email message to the user that the user's PII has been successfully opted out of our database. If you do not receive this confirmatory email, then please contact us to ensure that your request was received and processed.
