## 4\. Categories of Individual Data Subjects

In general, Code42 may obtain personal data about several different types of individuals, including (i) Web site visitors, (ii) business or individual clients, and (iii) potential clients. Code42's practices with respect to each of these types of individual data subjects are described below.

## 5\. Web Site Visitors

Code42 generally collects, uses, and discloses information about website visitors in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

## 6\. Business or Individual Data

Code42 may obtain various types of personal data about our clients and Web Site visitors. Such data may include contact information names, address, phone number, and email address; information about products and services ordered or provided; payment information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, credit card verification number and expiration date), passwords, and information collected through Internet-based and e-commerce activities (including information collected through log files, cookies, clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/ Web Bugs), images, and scripts, or from our third-party service providers), and other transaction-related data.

The personal data we collect through our downloadable software is: name, email address, and password.

Code42 may use these types of personal data for business purposes, including to deliver or provide products or services; to establish or maintain client and business relationships; to provide access to Internet-based and e-commerce activities; to perform accounting functions; and to conduct other activities as necessary or appropriate in connection with the servicing and development of the business relationship.

Our clients may update, access, delete inaccuracies, or correct their personal data by making the change within their account once logged into the site or by contacting us at [privacy@code42.com](mailto:privacy@code42.com) to do so. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days. Also, to the extent that any of these individuals receive marketing communications from Code42, and wish to unsubscribe or otherwise stop receiving such communications, they can contact us at [privacy@code42.com](mailto:privacy@code42.com).

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active and as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as reasonably necessary to conduct our business, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## 7\. Clients

Code42 provides a wide variety of services and solutions to its business clients ("Clients") that facilitate services including backing up and restoring files and copying backup archives to external hard drives for the purposes of allowing Clients to restore archives for individuals ("Data Subjects"). In some instances, Code42 may obtain access to personal data about such Data Subject in the course of providing the services and solutions (such as when the Client purchases a service in which the backup archive is external hard drives for the purposes of allowing Clients to restore archives for individuals). In other specific instances, Code42 may also obtain access to data about our Clients' end users in the course of providing support services to the Clients ("End Users"). Such data may include email address, CrashPlan and SharePlan system configuration, log files and other information, depending on the particular Client and application at issue.

Wherever we obtain access to personal data about Data Subjects or End Users, we are acting as a mere data processor on behalf of our Clients, and we therefore conduct such activities strictly in accordance with their instructions and pursuant to our contractual arrangements with them. If you are an End User with an existing relationship with one of our Clients, you should refer to the Client's website to understand the privacy practices that apply to personal data that we may maintain about you. Moreover, if you would like to access and review your personal data, you should contact our Client with any such requests. We will cooperate as appropriate with requests from our Clients to assist with such responses.

## 8\. Communications from the Site

We will occasionally send you information on products, services, or promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these promotional types of communications. You may opt-out from receiving these types of communications by following the instructions included in each communication, within your account settings, or by emailing us at [privacy@code42.com](mailto:privacy@code42.com).

## 9\. Service-related Announcements

We will send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.

## 10\. Other Necessary Disclosures

Code42 may disclose personal data to business partners as appropriate in connection with a legitimate business need. In addition, Code42 discloses personal data to service providers as needed for such service providers to perform services on behalf of Code42. Service providers may not use personal data for other purposes.

Code42 may also disclose personal data as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business; once information about such a sale or transfer may be shared publicly, Code42 will inform you of the sale or transfer by a prominent notice on our website(s) and that notice will include information about choices you have regarding your personal data. In the event of a sale or transfer, Code42 will require the recipient of the data to protect the data in accordance with the relevant principles in the Safe Harbors, or otherwise take steps to ensure that personal data is appropriately protected. Code42 may also disclose personal data where required or permitted by law such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, or where Code42 believes that such disclosures are appropriate to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or in connection with a law enforcement request.

Code42 will not sell, share, rent or trade your personal data with third parties other than as disclosed within this privacy statement.

## 11\. Data Security and Integrity

Code42 has global hosting centers that store and process personal data in various locations in the United States. US hosting centers include facilities in Minneapolis and Atlanta. Code42 takes reasonable precautions to protect personal data in these centers and in other locations in the United States from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Code42 also makes reasonable efforts to keep personal data reliable for its intended use, accurate, current, and complete.

The security of your personal data is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
