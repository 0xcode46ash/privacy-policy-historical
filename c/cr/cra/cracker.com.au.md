### What kind of personal information Cracker collects and how it is collected

Cracker collects personal information from a variety of sources, including from members of the public, advertisers, prospective employees, mailing lists, recruitment agencies, contractors and business partners. 

In general, the personal information Cracker collects includes (but is not limited to) name, address, contact details, gender, occupation, in some cases membership of professional associations and, where relevant, financial information, including credit card information, banking details and income information. 

_Personal Information you provide_ : We store the personal information you enter on the Cracker website or give to Cracker in other ways. We obtain most personal information through the posting of ads or discussion forums via the Cracker website. You may provide information when you request or acquire a product or service from Cracker or its related companies, provide a product or service to Cracker, complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a competition, participate in forums or when you communicate with Cracker by e-mail, telephone or in writing (for example if you contact customer service or provide feedback). 

_Automatic collection_ : Cookies: We may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign your computer a 'User ID'. Cookies do not contain information by which Cracker can identify you. They identify your computer to our servers. You may configure your browser so that you are notified before a cookie is downloaded or so that your browser does not accept cookies. Cracker may use information contained in cookies to make assumptions about the user of the computer and to provide users of that computer with focused advertising which Cracker believes may be of interest, based on that information. To disable your cookies, please refer to the help menu within your Internet browser. 

_Indirect collection_ : Cracker endeavours to collect personal information about an individual only from that individual. In some circumstances Cracker may obtain personal information from a third party. If you provide personal information about another person to Cracker, Cracker requires that you inform that person you have done so and provide them with a copy of this policy. 

### How Cracker uses the information you provide

Cracker may use information it collects from you for the primary purpose for which it is collected and for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose of collection. 

Cracker generally uses personal information to: 

  * provide you with products or services you have requested
  * personalise and customise your experiences on the Cracker website;
  * help Cracker manage and enhance its services;
  * communicate with you; 
  * provide you with ongoing information about opportunities on the Cracker website in which Cracker believes you may be interested;
  * give you the opportunity from time to time to receive e-mail from Cracker.



If you do not provide Cracker with that information, Cracker will not be able to provide you with the requested product or service. 

### Disclosure

Cracker may disclose personal information to other companies in the Fairfax Group which may only use it as set out above. 

Cracker may also provide your information to: 

  * third parties engaged by Cracker to perform functions on its behalf, such as processing credit card information, mailouts, debt collection, marketing, research and advertising;
  * third parties authorised by you to receive information held by Fairfax;



If Cracker sells part of its business, personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the purchaser. 

The Cracker Network contains features where you are invited to send personal information to organisations other than Cracker. The choice to send such information to these organisations is entirely yours. You should be aware that any such information you choose to send will not be bound by this policy.
