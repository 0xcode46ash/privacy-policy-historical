**Collecting Information About You** In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.

There may be times when we ask you to provide certain information about yourself, such as your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, birth date, gender, occupation, personal interests, etc. That information is needed when you chose to make a purchase, subscribe to our newsletter, participate in surveys, or enter contests, sweepstakes or promotions. We also maintain a record of your online product purchases, however we do not keep your credit card information on file. Whether or not to provide such information is completely your own choice. But if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to purchase products, or access certain services, offers and content on our website.

We may contract with companies or persons to provide certain services including credit card processing, shipping, data management, promotional services, etc. We call them our Service Providers. We provide our Service Providers with the information needed for them to perform these services.

**Cookies**

Our website does not use "cookies." We do occasionally use what is called a "session cookie" but that cookie is removed as soon as you close your web browser window. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. You can generally set your browser to not accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. If you choose to NOT accept a cookie, you may not be able to view certain pages.

We may contract with third parties who may use cookies and collect information on our behalf. These third parties are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us.

  
**Security**

We use sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of your personal information that you share with us. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our web sites, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we will do our best to protect its security on our systems.
