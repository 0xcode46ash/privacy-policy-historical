Our Commitment to Your Privacy

Credit.com is a California-based company and strongly supports the inalienable right of privacy guaranteed to all people by the California Constitution. While you may not be protected by the California Constitution, and although Credit.com is not a “financial institution” and therefore is not governed by the California Financial Information Privacy Act (Sections 4050 et seq. of the California Financial Code, commonly referred to as “S.B. 1”), Credit.com nonetheless is firmly committed to protecting your personal privacy. As part of that commitment, we communicate this Privacy Policy to every Credit.com employee, and we require that each Credit.com employee follow it. In addition, employee access to information about individual customers is limited to those authorized employees with a legitimate business reason to access the information, and then only on a “need-to-know” basis.

Why We Collect Information

Among its operations, Credit.com functions as a consumer credit intermediary, linking consumers with various consumer credit products and services. If you are applying for any of those products or services, Credit.com may collect the personal information you provide us to enroll you as a customer or to complete a transaction. In these circumstances, however, our principal role is to facilitate a relationship in which you provide your information directly to a third party B for instance, to apply for extension of credit, or to purchase a credit report or other credit-related products or services -- rather than to us. We collect information as a consumer credit intermediary to enable us to:

  * Transmit the information to a third-party lender or service provider (subscribers) who process or provide applications for the product or service you request.
  * Communicate with you about your applications for products or services.
  * Confirm the acceptance and status of your request by e-mail.
  * Respond to your inquiries about the status and/or destination of your applications.
  * Identify the referring web site if you link to us from another web site.
  * Delete fictitious data from our systems, based on a customer identifier such as a home telephone number or e-mail address.
  * Handle accounting issues between us and our subscribers and affiliates, using a customer identifier such as a home telephone number or e-mail address, if the subscriber rejects your application.
  * Conduct market and demographic analyses on aggregated customer data, which does not identify individual customers.
  * Perform system and security monitoring, such as monitoring the IP addresses of incoming traffic to prevent abuse.



Credit.com also provides consumer credit education services. To do so, we may collect your name and your e-mail address to enable us, if you desire, to send you e-mail newsletters and other information about our consumer education services and other programs.

In each of these circumstances, we will only collect and use the minimum information needed to accomplish the stated purpose, and only with your full knowledge and consent.

Credit.com is registered with VeriSign®, the best-known certificate authority, and has obtained digital certificates from VeriSign® for www.credit.com and its subdomains and affiliated domains.

Disclosure of Your Information

Credit.com does not provide your personally identifiable information to affiliated or unaffiliated companies for their independent use, except when we transmit the information to subscribers who process or provide applications for the product or service you request.

If possible, we will attempt to comply with any legal request for our cooperation by eliminating all personally identifiable information before releasing our records. If that is not possible, before we provide your personally identifiable information to a third party as required by law, we will seek the issuance of a protective order by a court of competent jurisdiction compelling the third party to maintain the confidentiality of that information.
