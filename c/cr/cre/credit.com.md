It governs Credit.com's collection, use and disclosure of non-public personal information ("NPPI"), defined below, received from our current and former customers or collected by us concerning our current and former customers. We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make changes to this policy, we will change the date above. If we change this policy in a way that allows us to use your NPPI in a materially different manner, we will notify you here, by e-mail, or by means of a notice on our homepage prior to the change becoming effective, and we will obtain your opt-in consent before using your NPPI in such a materially different manner.

  * What information we collect, and how we collect it;
  * How we use information we collect;
  * With whom we share collected information;
  * What choices you have regarding the use of the information we collect; and
  * The types of security we use to protect the information we collect.

Credit.com is dedicated to protecting the privacy of our customers.

Credit.com Inc. has received TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal. The TRUSTe program does not cover information that may be collected through downloadable software. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this website, www.credit.com.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe [here](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request).

### 1\. What information we collect and how we collect it.

We collect the following categories of NPPI: (i) information you provide, such as your contact information; (ii) information about your transactions with us or our affiliates; (iii) information about your transactions with unaffiliated third-parties to whom your information is disclosed by us to fulfill a transaction you request, such as obtaining a personal loan or credit card; and (iv) information obtained from any consumer reporting agency, such as your credit history.

### 2\. Non-public personal information

NPPI includes any information: (i) you provide to obtain a financial product or service; (ii) about you resulting from any transaction involving a financial product or service; or (iii) that we otherwise obtain about you in connection with providing a financial product or service that you request. This type of information does not include information that is collected anonymously or for the purpose of tracking movement on our website. In order for you to access many of the products and services offered through this site, you may be required to provide us with NPPI, such as:

  * Name;
  * Street or postal address;
  * E-mail address;
  * Phone number;
  * Your place of employment, employer, length of time you worked there;
  * Number of years you lived in your home or other information about your home;
  * Loan purpose and loan amount;
  * Social Security number;
  * Date of birth;
  * Debit or credit card number, expiration date and security code.



This information is used to identify you, complete your requests for financial products or services, facilitate requests for other products or services, and for customer service fulfillment.

### 3\. Traffic data

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. Though we may link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you, we will not share any of this automatically collected data.

No NPPI that identifies a customer or former customer is revealed in the collection and use of traffic data. Consequently, we do not adjust or alter our website's automatic tracking and data collection in response to a Do Not Track signal or request. We believe we can offer customers a more personalized experience when visiting our website when we are able to retrieve data from a customer's previous activity on our website. We do share anonymous traffic and transactional information with our affiliates and service providers on an aggregate basis for marketing, accounting and site-optimization purposes.

### 4\. Categories of information we disclose

Credit.com may disclose the NPPI we collect about you, described above, to our affiliates or unaffiliated third-parties, as described below, and as otherwise permitted by law.

> (i) To financial institutions, related companies and other trusted businesses or persons who use, analyze, or process it on our behalf, based on our instructions, and in compliance with appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we may use others to: 
> 
>   * deliver, evaluate the effectiveness of, and assist in improving our products and services 
>   * conduct consumer research and satisfaction surveys 
>   * assist us in analyzing and understanding consumers and how to reach them more effectively 
>   * assist us in fraud prevention, with our security measures, and to provide us technical support 
>   * provide customer support, including contacting you by telephone or email on our behalf 
>   * manage customer data, and to ensure data integrity and accuracy 
>   * process financial transactions and perform accounting functions 
>   * advertise, market, or make product or service offerings
> 

> 
> When a financial institution or other third party contacts you, its use of your information is subject to its privacy policy and not ours; and
> 
> (ii) To affiliates and service providers that perform professional services for us, such as demographic analysis for marketing purposes and accounting or assistance with marketing, advertising, product/service offerings and customer service fulfillment. These companies are authorized to use your NPPI only as necessary to provide these services to us. For example, we may provide your contact information to our service providers for direct emailing of our newsletters or to provide you with notifications of our product/service offerings via email, phone or text message.

Selected NPPI, such as your Social Security number and debit or credit card numbers, expiration dates and security codes are immediately encrypted.

Credit.com does not sell, rent or otherwise disclose your NPPI to third parties except as explained in this privacy policy and as permitted by law.

We may share aggregated information (i.e., collective information about you and other customers, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other deidentified or anonymous information we collect with third parties.

### 5\. Why we need your e-mail address

We use your e-mail address to:

  * Confirm your identity;
  * Send you information on the status of your transaction;
  * Contact you if we need your assistance to complete the transaction;

Credit.com has a zero tolerance policy for e-mail abuse. If you receive unsolicited e-mails from Credit.com, please report it to us at [http://support.credit.com](http://support.credit.com/). We are not responsible for communications you may receive from unaffiliated third-parties.

We will never ask you to provide NPPI in an e-mail. DO NOT RESPOND to an e-mail that appears to be from us requesting NPPI. Contact us immediately at [http://support.credit.com](http://support.credit.com/).

If you contact us by e-mail, we will respond by e-mail.

### 6\. What choices you have regarding the use of your information

**E-mail correspondence.** You may opt out of receiving e-mails from us in one of two ways:

  1. If you subscribe to the service online, you may "uncheck" the box next to the offer on the online form you complete; or
  2. Click on the 'unsubscribe' link in the e-mail you receive.



When you unsubscribe, you will receive an e-mail confirming your decision to opt out.

**Confirmations.** You may not opt out of confirmation e-mail messages and messages that are part of the service to which you are subscribed. They are designed to confirm your identity and your decision to enter into a transaction. Confirmation e-mails often contain important instructions about your transaction. If you do not wish to receive confirmation e-mails, do not sign up for services or products on this website.

### 7\. Your access to identifying NPPI

If you want to delete your identifying NPPI, including your e-mail address, or if you no longer are interested in a service found on this website, you may request deletion of your identifying NPPI or deactivation by contacting customer service at [http://support.credit.com](http://support.credit.com/). We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. In the event that certain information cannot be deleted (because, for example, the information is being retained to document compliance or to ensure that Credit.com can enforce its legal rights), we may not delete such information. Information entered on the Credit.com website will be automatically updated each time you apply for a new or different service. In addition, we will deactivate your account when you send such a request to [http://support.credit.com](http://support.credit.com/). Please note that deactivation of your account will not necessarily result in the deletion of your NPPI.

### 8\. Credit.com reserves the right to disclose your NPPI, including your e-mail address, without notice or your consent:

  1. To comply with federal, state or local laws, rules and other applicable legal requirements; or
  2. To comply with a properly authorized civil, criminal, or regulatory investigation, or subpoena or summons by federal, state or local authorities; or
  3. To respond to judicial process or government regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over Credit.com for examination, compliance, other purposes as authorized by law; or
  4. To enforce our Terms of Service; or
  5. To permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; or
  6. To our service providers to verify the integrity of the information collected; or
  7. To our affiliated business partners for accounting purposes; or
  8. For any other purpose permitted by applicable law.



### 9\. Business Transitions

If Credit.com is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your NPPI or other information may be disclosed to third parties concerned or their professional advisors. In the event of such a transaction, the NPPI held by Credit.com will be among the assets transferred to the buyer.

### 10\. Important note regarding non-U.S. users and U.S. law

The laws and regulations of different countries and states impose different requirements on data protections and the use of the Internet. Credit.com is located in California, in the United States of America, as are the servers that make this website available worldwide. The laws of the State of California and the United States of America govern all matters relating to this website. If you provide information while using this website, you will be deemed to have authorized the transfer of your information to our servers in California.

### 11\. Children

We do not knowingly solicit information from children or send them requests for information. Although there are links to other websites that may offer services to persons under the age of 18, Credit.com does not offer any services for person under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you may browse our website, but you may not provide personal information to us (such as name, address, or e-mail address), and you may not register for, enroll in, and/or purchase and product or service.

### 12\. This privacy policy applies to www.credit.com

This privacy policy applies only to the website http://www.credit.com and the users of the website. It does not apply to any other website whether it is a website that you may link to, or a website that may link to this website. Credit.com is not responsible for the privacy practices on any other website or of any other entity or person. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of any website you visit and the companies that operate them.

### 13\. Social Media

Our website offers publicly accessible blogs and/or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.

You have the option to post comments on our blog page through a third-party platform. These platforms are managed by a third-party application that may require you to register to post a comment. We do not have access or control of the information posted to the blog. You will need to contact or login into the third-party application if you want the personal information that was posted to the comments section removed. To learn how the third-party application uses your information, please review its privacy policy.

Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and Widgets, such as the Share button or interactive mini-programs that run on our website. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our website and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.

### 14\. Testimonials

### 15\. Privacy policies and unaffiliated third-parties

We do not permit third parties to collect NPPI on our website, but our website does include links to third-party websites, services and products, and when you link to a third-party website, the third- party website's privacy policy applies. In addition, you authorize us to provide your NPPI to unaffiliated third parties (including, without limitation, CSIdentity Corporation) when you request a financial product or service offered by a third party.

Because this privacy policy applies only to the Credit.com website, it may be different from the privacy policies of the unaffiliated third parties to whom your NPPI is disclosed to process the financial product or service you request or authorize. Credit.com urges you to review the privacy policies of every website you visit where you are required to disclose your NPPI to obtain a product or service.

When you access a third party site, even through this website, you are bound by the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy of that third party site.

### 16\. Your use of this website

By using this website, you represent to us that you are an adult under the laws of the jurisdiction where you reside and that you have had an opportunity to review the terms of this privacy policy and the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms/) posted on this website. Do not use this website or disclose any NPPI if the terms of this privacy policy are not acceptable to you or if you do not agree to all provisions of our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms/).

### 17\. Protect and verify your identifying NPPI

We urge you to take adequate precautions to protect your identifying NPPI, both on and off the Internet. (To learn more go to: <http://onguardonline.gov/index.html>)

### 19\. Security

Credit.com is a VeriSign® secured website and uses a VeriSign® SSL Certificate for encryption. Customer data is securely transmitted by Credit.com to unaffiliated third parties as permitted by this privacy policy or by law and to service providers through a combination of encryption techniques and other privacy protection measures. Selected NPPI submitted through the Credit.com website, such as your Social Security number or payment card data, are encrypted.

Credit.com also maintains and enforces strict internal policies to protect NPPI from unauthorized access by employees or third parties. When you submit information to Credit.com through our website, you should be aware that your information is transmitted across the Internet and that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Although we take reasonable security measures to protect your information when we receive it, you also need to ensure you take appropriate steps to protect your information. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at [http://support.credit.com](http://support.credit.com/). If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please notify us of the problem as soon as possible by contacting us in accordance with the "Contact us" section above (note that if you choose to notify us via physical mail, this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem).

### 20\. Tracking Technologies

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Credit.com and our partners (e.g., email service providers), affiliates, or analytics or service providers (e.g., online customer support providers). These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the website, tracking users' movements around the website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual, as well as aggregate, basis.

We use cookies to remember users' settings (e.g., language preference), for authentication, and to track and manage marketing. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our website, but your ability to use some features or areas of our website may be limited.

### 21\. Behavioral Targeting

We partner with third-party advertising networks to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other websites.

### 22\. Terms Used in This Statement

  


#### Encryption

Credit.com uses encryption to secure selected NPPI such as Social Security number and payment card data. Encryption is a way to scramble data to make it unreadable to anyone other than the intended recipient. If it is intercepted by a third party while traveling over a network, it cannot be read. Only the persons sending and receiving the encrypted data have a key to unscramble the data and make it readable. Credit.com uses industry standard SSL, AES and RSA encryption.

#### Secure Sockets Layer

Secure Sockets Layer is the industry standard method for protecting website communications by encrypting information, thus making it unreadable to anyone except the holders of the keys used to read the information. Credit.com uses the SSL protocol to capture selected NPPI, such as your credit card numbers, via the Internet.

#### SSL Certificate

A SSL Certificate binds an entity to a pair of electronic keys that can be used to encrypt and sign digital information. A SSL Certificate makes it possible for you to verify that we have the right to use a given key, helping to prevent others from using phony keys to impersonate us. For more information about our certificate, click on the VeriSign® logo.

#### Third-Party Data Sources

We use third parties to verify the integrity of selected NPPI you provide so we can confirm your identity.

Other important information  
For Nevada residents only: We are providing you this notice under state law. We will not telemarket to you.

Credit.com, Customer Support: [http://support.credit.com](http://support.credit.com/). 

Vermont: Under Vermont law, we will not share information we collect about Vermont residents with companies outside of our corporate family, unless the law allows. For example, we may share information with your consent, to service your accounts or under joint marketing agreements with other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements. We will not share information about your creditworthiness within our corporate family except with your consent, but we may share information about our transactions or experiences with you within our corporate family without your consent. 

California: Under California law, we will not share information we collect about you with companies outside of Credit.com, unless the law allows. For example, we may share information with your consent, to service your accounts, or to provide rewards or benefits you are entitled to. We will limit sharing among our companies to the extent required by California law. 

### 23\. Consumer Surveys

Credit.com may invite you to join a survey panel through which you will be able to share your opinions about proposed new services or other issues relevant to Credit.com and its services. Your participation in this panel is voluntary and is not required in order to engage Credit.com's services. Opting in also does not affect your ongoing services. If you are invited to join a survey panel, your input may be sought in order to assist Credit.com to better market its services to interested consumers and provide more efficient and effective services overall. You agree that Credit.com, including its third party providers, can use (as it chooses and at its sole discretion) any information and feedback you provide in response to survey and panel questions. You acknowledge and agree that Credit.com will be the sole owner of the services and survey questions about which you provide information and feedback and that you have no claim to any Credit.com services or the revenue or profits derived from them. You hereby assign to Credit.com all intellectual property rights embodied in the information and feedback you provide to Credit.com (about the services and in response to the survey questions) and shall execute any documents necessary to effect the foregoing. All information and feedback you provide to Credit.com as part of the panel is the confidential business proprietary information of Credit.com and you shall not disclose such information and feedback to anyone other than the designated individuals at Credit.com responsible for the services and/or survey(s). You warrant and represent that your participation on the panel will not violate the rights of any person or entity and will not cause liability for payment to any entity or person.

If you participate, you will be awarded points based on your completing surveys and otherwise engaging in the panel. You acknowledge and agree that you understand that any points or awards provided are solely for completing surveys and otherwise participating in the panel. It is within Credit.com's sole discretion to decide what award to provide and the points that will be required for an award. The award system may be changed at Credit.com's discretion, but if a panel participant has met the minimum requirement for an award, that award will be provided to the individual before applying a new incentive structure.

Because your participation in the panel is not required for your Credit.com services, you may opt out of the panel at any time without terminating your Credit.com services. Similarly, you may continue serving on the panel even if your Credit.com service ends. You will need to opt out of the panel in order to no longer receive emails or informational material about the panel surveys unless participation is terminated by Credit.com.

Credit.com reserves the right to terminate your participation in the panel at any time. Some of the reasons your participation in the panel may be terminated include, but are not limited to, inactivity from all panel activities for a period of time or offensive conduct toward Credit.com, its employees, contractors, or agents, or toward fellow panel members. If Credit.com terminates your participation or if you voluntarily cancel your participation, you will receive the appropriate award for all points you have accrued to date if those points have accumulated to the minimum required for any award; otherwise, all points will be forfeited.

As a member of the panel, you will receive e-mails and other material from our third party provider(s) and you may be asked additional information about yourself. The personally identifying information you provide Credit.com and third party provider(s) will be treated as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Under no circumstances will Credit.com share with its third party provider(s) information about your Credit.com services unless you provide specific, written authorization to do so.

You also acknowledge and understand that information you provide as part of the panel will be kept on the platform provided by Credit.com's third party provider(s). This type of information may include answers you have given as part of the panel registration process and substantive answers you have given in surveys.
