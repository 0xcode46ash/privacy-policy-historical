Thank you for your interest in Credit Solutions. Your privacy is very important to us. Our policy is to respect and protect the privacy of the visitors to our web sites and those who trust us with their e-mail addresses. In this document, we explain how we use the information you supply us. If we update our privacy policy, all revisions will be posted on this page. We reserve the right to change the privacy policy at any time.

For your convenience we have organized our privacy policy into the following topics:

Our Commitment to Security

**INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE**  
Two types of information may be collected when you visit any of our web sites, information that you knowingly provide us (called personally identifiable information), and information that is obtained from your visit but is not directly associated with you (called non-personally identifiable information).

When you sign up to use one or more of our services, ask a question or purchase merchandise, we may specifically ask for information about you, including, but not limited to name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, birth date and/or payment information. This information is used to fulfill the services you requested or to improve our web site offerings to you and users like you. In the normal course of using Credit Solutions's web sites we may collect information about your habits and usage of our sites. This non-personally identifiable information is collected without any direct association with you specifically.

**INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE**  
Agents, employees and contractors of Credit Solutions, who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the high standards of the company. Information about you specifically will not be used for any purpose other than to carry out the services you requested from Credit Solutions and its affiliates.

We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone at any time without your prior permission. We will not use any personal information beyond what is necessary to assist us in delivering to you the services you have requested.

1\. We will send personally identifiable information about you to other organizations or people only when:  
2\. We have your consent to share the information,  
3\. We need to share your information in order to provide the product or service you have requested; or  
4\. We are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.

We routinely use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our sites and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services to you or other users like you.

**USES OF E-MAIL ADDRESSES**  
Credit Solutions may periodically send promotional e-mail. You will not receive such e-mail messages unless at the time you provided us with your e-mail address you indicated that you wished to receive such promotional e-mail. If you are asked for your e-mail address and not given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving additional information, then the e-mail address is to be used for the specific service you requested only and will be deleted when you request the service be discontinued. You may request discontinuation of e-mail messages by sending such requests by e-mail to [customercare@creditsolutions.com.](mailto:customercare@creditsolutions.com)

**COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SPONSORS**  
Sometimes Credit Solutions's web sites may contain links to various other sites not owned and operated by Credit Solutions. While we encourage other site developers to adopt privacy policies that build user's trust and confidence, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of web sites either linked to our sites or to which we link. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy policies, as we have no control over the information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

**USE OF COOKIES**  
Cookies are small text files that may be placed on your computer's hard drive by our servers to identify your computer. Cookies we may place are only read by the server that placed them there and are unable to execute any code or virus. We may use cookies to recognize you when you visit our sites, to personalize your experience and generally to serve you better. For example, if you enter your name, address, telephone number, email address, zip code or other personally identifiable information on one of our forms, such information may be, but is not necessarily always, stored in a cookie so you do not have to enter this information again.

**IP ADDRESSES**  
An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer whenever you're using the Internet. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. Credit Solutions collects IP addresses in our web site logs for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated information, and to audit the use of our site. When visitors request pages from Credit Solutions' site, our servers log the visitor's IP address. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us.

**OUR COMMITMENT TO SECURITY**  
We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect via the Internet. We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information in any way and at any time without your prior knowledge and permission.
