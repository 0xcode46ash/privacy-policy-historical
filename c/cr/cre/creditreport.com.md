# Check your Credit Report Online at Creditreport.com!

Each customer is required to provide personal data and credit information as required by the 3 national credit bureaus to insure that the credit report is seen by the individual who has requested it and is authorized to view it. 


## Your Privacy Matters!

Creditreport.com is committed to maintaining the integrity of our customer's privacy.

We take extraordinary measures to ensure that your information is secure. After significant research and due diligence we may share your information with third parties who we feel offer products and services that may be beneficial to our customers.

Information such as your name, address and email address (but never such information as your social security number) may be shared with these third parties that have successfully passed our initial quality assurance certification, to provide such offers to you. Our quality assurance certification ensures that those third parties with whom we share your information maintain security and confidentiality procedures necessary to continue protecting your privacy. You will always be given the chance, if you prefer not to receive such information, to indicate your preference when you place an order or when updating your account information. 




## Types of Information

Depending upon which of our services you are utilizing, the types of nonpublic personal information that we may collect include: 
    * Information we receive from you on applications, forms and in other communications to us, whether in writing, in person, by telephone or any other means; 
    * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliated companies, or others; 
    * Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency; 



## Use of Information

We request information from you or obtain information about you for legitimate business purposes. 

Therefore, we will not release your information to any party, whether affiliated with us or not, except: (1) as necessary for us to provide the product or service you have requested of us; (2) as disclosed in this privacy policy; or (3) as permitted by law. We may, however, store such information, including during the period after which any customer relationship has ceased. 

Such information may be used for any internal purpose, such as quality control efforts or customer analysis.

Even if you are no longer our customer, our Privacy Policy will continue to apply to you.
