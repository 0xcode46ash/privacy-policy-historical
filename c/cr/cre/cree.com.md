# Cree Privacy Policy

As used in this Privacy Policy, "Cree" refers to Cree, Inc. and its subsidiaries. This Privacy Policy covers Cree's treatment of information about you that Cree collects when you visit this website. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Cree does not own or control or of people who are not employed or managed by Cree. 

**Information that Cree collects**

Cree collects information about you in two different ways.  The first is when you voluntarily provide information to us.  The second is through automatic collection of traffic and other information about visitors to our website. 

**Information that you voluntarily provide to us**

Cree may ask you for personal information when you sign up to use a website feature. You can read some of the company and product information available on the website without revealing any personal information. However, in certain places on this website you may be asked to provide your name and/or email address in order to communicate with us, or to open an account that may involve providing information such as your name, company, email address, telephone number, mailing address, and credit card numbers. It is your option to provide the information requested.  In addition, Cree will retain records of any messages that may send to us through this website or other websites owned by Cree, by email, by communication with Cree through social media sites, or by posting (if that feature is provided on any Cree websites).

Cree does not seek information from persons less than 13 years of age, and no information should be submitted to this website by visitors less than 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.

**Information collected automatically**

When you visit our website Cree’s information technology systems automatically collect information about the equipment you are using and about your use of our website and services.  Equipment information includes information about your browser and, if you are viewing the website through a telephone, may include your telephone number.  If you have an account with Cree, this equipment information may be associated with your account.  Automatically collected information also includes various types of log or other session information, which can include such things as the settings of your browser, the Internet Protocol address of your equipment, search queries that you have made on the website, pages that you have viewed, and the length of your visit to the website.  Depending upon the settings of your browser, Cree may also make use of “cookies” or other technology to store information about you and your visits to this website on your equipment so that Cree’s systems can recognize you and services be provided more efficiently to you the next time you access our website. 

**Cree’s use of information**

The information that Cree collects is used by Cree to respond to specific requests or product orders that you have made and to improve the services that we provide to you and to other visitors to our website. Depending upon the settings that you have chosen for your account, your information may be used by Cree and/or Cree’s agents and distributors to inform you about Cree’s products and services that we think may be of interest to you, or to send to you important information about Cree’s products and services that you have previously ordered. 

**Your choices about use**

If you have created an account with Cree, you can access your account through this website at any time to view and edit your account information and to change settings that affect how Cree uses and retains information that has been collected about you.  You should be aware that deleted or changed information may be retained in Cree’s backup archives and may be kept by Cree for legitimate business or legal purposes.  You can also adjust the settings of your browser to block cookies, but this may inhibit or delay services provided through this website.

**Disclosure of Information**

Cree does not disclose personally identifiable information collected from you during visits to this website except as provided in this paragraph.  First, such information may be shared among Cree, Inc. and its subsidiaries and Cree’s agents and distributors for purposes of providing products or services that you have ordered.  In addition, Cree may use your information and share your information with its agents and distributors for the purpose of communicating with you concerning Cree’s products and services; if you have an account, such use of your information can be limited by the account settings you choose.  Any of Cree’s agents or distributors who receive your information from Cree will be obliged to keep that information confidential and not to use it except for the purposes stated above.  Second, Cree may share your information with third party service providers as necessary for processing payments made by credit or debit card or through a payment service and for fulfilling and delivering ordered products or other material.   Third, Cree may disclose your information if Cree has a good faith belief that such disclosure is required by law, is required in order to enforce the Terms of Use for this website or other Cree websites, or is necessary to detect, prevent or address fraud or security issues or to prevent harm to Cree or others.  Fourth, Cree may transfer your information to companies that acquire from Cree any of the lines of business that have been displayed on this website.

**About IP Addresses**

Cree collects Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for the purposes of system administration. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers -- the computers that "serve" up Web pages for viewing by your Web browser -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address.  Our servers log a visitor’s IP address when the visitor’s Web browser requests pages from this website. In general, we do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.  We may, however, attempt to link an IP address to personal information if it appears that that IP address is being used to commit fraud or in connection with security breaches or attempts to disrupt the operation of Cree’s websites.

**Changes**

This Privacy Policy may be changed by Cree from time to time.  Each version of the Privacy Policy will be dated and will come into effect when posted at this location.  You can check this location during any visit to this website to determine if there has been any change since your last visit.
