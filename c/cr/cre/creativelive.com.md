**Collection of Data/Contact Information/Financial Information**

**IP Address and Cookies**

We use your internet protocol address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. We also use your internet protocol address to help identify you and your shopping cart. 

Our website places “cookies” on your computer’s hard drive through your web browsers to keep track of your identity for the purposes of saving your shopping cart and saving your logged-in state so that you do not have to log in each time you visit our website. “Cookies” allow our website to recognize your computer when you access the website.

**Contact Information/Financial Information**

Our website’s registration and order forms require users to provide us with contact information to establish membership accounts and purchase services and products.  CL collects each user’s name, address, city, state, postal code, telephone number and e-mail address.  CL uses this information to contact the user regarding purchases, orders and administrative matters (such as reminders regarding the start time/date for an instructional program you chose to attend). New users must opt in to receive commercial communications and may opt out of receiving future commercial communications at any time (see “Anti-Spam Policy/Opt-out Choice” below). 

CL does not store the financial information entered by users, such as credit card numbers and related financial account  information. The financial information is only used to bill the user for products and services. 

CL does not rent, sell or exchange user information, and generally restricts access to user information to qualified CL employees and agents. CL may transmit a customer’s credit card data only to the appropriate credit card company and/or credit card payment processing company. Third parties who need access to CL user information to provide operational or other support services are required by CL to maintain high standards of security. CL gathers only user information that is needed to administer its business and enhance and improve its services and products. 

CL may disclose a user’s contact or financial information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with an order of a court or government authority, or a subpoena. CL may also disclose a user’s contact or financial information in the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to protect CL or the website, or enforce the applicable Terms and Conditions, in conjunction with an investigation or legal, equitable or administrative action or proceeding. 

CL may collect information on the services and products viewed by you on the website. CL may use this information to customize your experience and suggest and offer you products according to your preferences. CL may use this information to identify patterns and trends of use, but will only release or publish any such information in a manner that preserves your anonymity. 

CL may transfer part or all of your information in the case of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of all or a portion of CL’s assets or stock.
