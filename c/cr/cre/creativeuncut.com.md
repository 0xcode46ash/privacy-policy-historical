**Privacy Policy**  
  
Visitor privacy is a serious subject for us. We provide this notice to you from the home page and all other major navigational pages, to help you understand exactly how your privacy is treated when visiting Creative Uncut. **Personal Information**  
We do not regularly attempt to collect personal information about our visitors. Our contact page email submission form will ask you for your name and email address. This information can only be input by you, and if received, will be kept strictly confidential. We will never share your email address or content of the email with a third party unless ordered by a court to do so. **Message Boards**  
Visitors wishing to use the Creative Uncut forums will be asked to provide their email to sign up. This is used to confirm your registration and will never be shared with a third party. Visitors will have the option of filling in additional personal details in the submission form. Please be aware that these details are for your public forum profile and as such will be viewable by the public. Caution should be taken when releasing any other personal details via the message boards. **Fan Art Submissions**  
Artists have the option of submitting their video game fan arts by email to be hosted by Creative Uncut. You agree to have the username of your choice along with your fan art posted on Creative Uncut. By default, your email address and real name will not be listed. However, if you express desire to have this information publicly listed, we will do so at your request. Should you request to have your email or real name listed, but later change your mind, we will remove it at your request. When submitting a fan art, your email and name will not be shared with a third party. **Cookies**  
In the process of serving advertisements on Creative Uncut, a third party advertiser may place a cookie in your browser. We have no control over these cookies, but we do actively ensure that we affiliate only with trusted advertisers. **Links**  
Creative Uncut contains links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy terms of such linked websites. **Changes to Our Policy**  
At times we may make changes to our privacy policy to enhance the accuracy of it or to reflect updates to our terms. Whenever we do so, the changes will be made directly to this page, and will always be available from our home page. **Questions or Concerns**  
If you have any further questions or related inquiries regarding our privacy policy, feel free to contact us about it via our [_about page_](https://web.archive.org/web/20071229235756id_/http%3A//www.creativeuncut.com/cat05.html).
