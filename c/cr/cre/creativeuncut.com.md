Visitor privacy is taken seriously here. This notice is provided to you from the home page and all other major navigational pages, to help you understand exactly how your privacy is treated when visiting the CreativeUncut.com domain and all of its subdomains. **Personal Information**  
We do not regularly attempt to collect personal information about our visitors. The contact page email submission form will ask you for your name and email address. This information can only be input by you, and if received, will be kept strictly confidential. We will never share your email address or content of the email with a third party unless ordered by a court to do so. **Message Boards**  
Visitors wishing to use the Creative Uncut forums will be asked to provide their email to sign up. This is used to confirm your registration and will never be shared with a third party. Visitors will have the option of filling in additional personal details in the submission form. Please be aware that these details are for your public forum profile and as such will be viewable by the public. Caution should be taken when releasing any other personal details via the message boards. **Fan Art Submissions**  
Artists have the option of submitting their video game fan arts by email to be hosted by Creative Uncut. You agree to have the username of your choice along with your fan art posted on Creative Uncut. By default, your email address and real name will not be listed. However, if you express desire to have this information publicly listed, we will do so at your request. Should you request to have your email or real name listed, but later change your mind, we will remove it at your request. When submitting a fan art, your email and name will not be shared with a third party. **Cookies**
