**What’s on Your Credit Report?**

Rev. 07/2011

WHAT DOES CREDIT ONE BANK, N.A.  
DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do.

The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you have with us. This information can include:

  * Social Security number and income
  * credit history and credit score
  * payment history and transaction history



All financial companies need to share customers' personal information to run their everyday business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their customers' personal information; the reasons Credit One Bank chooses to share; and whether you can limit this sharing. 

**For our everyday business purposes–**  
such as to process your transactions, maintain your  
account(s), respond to court orders and  
legal investigations, or report to credit bureaus

**For our marketing purposes–**  
to offer our products and services to you 

**For joint marketing with other financial companies**

**For our affiliates' everyday business purposes–**  
information about your transactions and experiences

**For our affiliates' everyday business purposes–**  
information about your creditworthiness

**Please note:**

If you are a _new_ customer, we can begin sharing your information 30 days from the date we sent this notice. When you are _no longer_ our customer, we continue to share your information as described in this notice.

However, you can contact us at any time to limit our sharing. 

**How does Credit One Bank  
protect my personal information?**

To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.

**How does Credit One Bank  
collect my personal information?**

We collect your personal information, for example, when you

  * apply for a loan or give us your contact information
  * pay your bill or use your credit card
  * give us your income information



We also collect your personal information from others, such as credit bureaus, affiliates, or other companies. 

**Why can't I limit all sharing?**

Federal law gives you the right to limit only 

  * sharing for affiliates' everyday business purposes–information about your creditworthiness
  * affiliates from using your information to market to you
  * sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you



State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. See below for more on your rights under state law. 

**What happens when I limit sharing  
for an account I hold jointly with  
someone else?**

Your choices will apply to everyone on your account.

Companies related by common ownership or control. They can be financial and nonfinancial companies. 

  * _Our Affiliates include the Sherman Financial Group LLC family of companies; financial companies such as Credit One Financial and Resurgent._



Companies not related by common ownership or control. They can be financial and nonfinancial companies. 

  * _Non-affiliates we share with can include retail lenders, insurance companies, direct marketing companies, and loan lead providers._



A formal agreement between nonaffiliated financial companies that together market financial products or services to you. 

  * _Our joint marketing partners include credit card companies, financial institutions and loan service providers._



Depending on where you live, you may have additional privacy protections under some state laws. For example, certain state laws may restrict the types of information we may disclose about you, limit the parties with whom we may share such information, or require us to provide you with additional notices or opt-out rights. We will comply with applicable state laws before sharing non-public personal information about you. We may do this by sending a separate notice of those rights to you.
