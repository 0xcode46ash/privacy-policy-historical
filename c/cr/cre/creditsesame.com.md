# Privacy Policy | Save Money with Credit Sesame

**Date Last Revised: October 1, 2010**

We recognize that your privacy is of utmost importance and take it seriously. This Privacy Policy describes Credit Sesame's policies and procedures on collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use Credit Sesame's site. This policy does not apply to information we collect through other means such as offline. For more details on site usage, please refer to Credit Sesame's [Terms of Use](http://www.creditsesame.com/how-we-help/terms-of-use/).

### Information Collection and Use

Credit Sesame uses the information we collect to do things like: analyze your credit and debt factors, find you personalized loan offers, maintain security, personalize content, remember information such as your email address, more efficiently access your account and set monitoring alerts. We also monitor aggregate metrics such as total visits and time on site.

**Information You Provide:** The information that you provide - including name, date of birth, email, real estate ownership, home address, social security, and any information about your finances (income, assets, debt, credit) - is used only to automatically and securely collection your personal financial information from trusted partners and is never sold to third parties.

Some of your information - such as name, address, social security number, and financial information (credit and debt) - is retained in encrypted form so that our system can continuously look for pre-qualified loan and mortgage offers through our proprietary algorithm.

We may also obtain personal information about you from our business partners and other third parties (for example, if you provide Credit Sesame your social security number so that we can retrieve monthly updates on your credit score and debt information from the credit Bureaus, or if you provide your address so that we can retrieve and track your current home value). In these cases, we will request your explicit permission.

We may use your name and email information to send you service related notifications, including any notices required by law. You can control the receipt of service related messages on the "Accounts" page. We may also send you marketing messages. You can always opt out of marketing messages by following the unsubscribe directions within the email message.

In the mortgage, loan, refinance or debt restructure application process, we may request and collect from you personal information of others, such as information about a co-borrower. The requested information may include social security, name, address and other financial as well as personal information for the co-borrower.

**Friend Invite:** If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to Credit Sesame, we will ask you for your friend's personal email address to send an automatic invitation message. Credit Sesame will store this information to track the success of our invitation functionality.

**Contests, Sweepstakes and Surveys:** In case of Credit Sesame related contests, sweepstakes or giveaways, any information you submit will be protected by this privacy and security policy, unless otherwise noted by the contest or sweepstake rules. Occasionally, we ask our users to take surveys to help us improve the site usability and product offering. Information provided for the survey will be used for survey purposes only and protected in accordance with Credit Sesame's Privacy Policy.

  * All personal and financial information is encrypted before transfer through 128-bit SSL with 2048 bit key. This is the strongest encryption method available for the internet and is used industry-wide by leading banks and financial websites. Encryption ensures that the information passed through our site is confidential.
  * We use password encoding before it is stored in our database. User passwords are protected from Credit Sesame employees and stored securely.
  * To provide additional protection, we use a "time out" feature that automatically logs out inactive users and requires reentry of login user name and password credentials before returning to the secure site.
