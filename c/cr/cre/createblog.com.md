  * your IP address, 
  * browser and version, 
  * operating system,

  * the site from which you came



are stored in a log file and/or database. This information cannot be used to identify specific individuals, and is only used for:

Use of cookies

Cookies are a technology which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a Website. A cookie is an element of data that a Website can send to your browser, and which your browser may then store on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. Doing this will allow you to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept cookies or not. 

Cookies on this site are used by ourselves, our ad management system, and occasionally by advertisers who use 3rd party ad serving solutions. Cookies are used for: 

  * ad tracking, 
  * customization of content (i.e. not repeating pop-up windows), 
  * storing login information, and
  * statistical site-traffic analysis.



Registering for the forums

The information collected during the registration process for the createBlog.com Community is used to: 

  * contact members, 
  * customize content based upon user preferences, 
  * display member status, and 
  * display the date of a member's last visit. 



Information collected in this process can also be used to prevent banned users from re-registering under a different username. The email address will only be seen by moderators and administrators if the “Keep your email address viewable to other users when you post notes?” option is set to no. Cookies may be sent to your browser to enable automatic log-ins upon further visits, as well as for content customization.
