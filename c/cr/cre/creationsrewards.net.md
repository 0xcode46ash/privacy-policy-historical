|  | **CreationsRewards.Net Privacy Policy**

CreationsRewards ("CR") is committed to protecting our members personal information. Below we explain what type of information we collect from our users and how we use the information on the website. CR links to other websites on the Internet, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy policies of such websites. _ **Information Collected**_  
When you join CR, we collect your name, address, Email address, and various demographics. This information is voluntarily, as members choose to signup for our online incentive program.

Each time you visit CR, our website automatically logs the following:  


  * Your current IP address
  * The Referrer link (Last site visited before you came here)
  * Web browser type

We use this information to diagnose problems that may arise when certain visitors come to the CR website. Web browser and IP information is also used when fraudulent activity arises.

We use your information given to customize your CR experience. We use cookies to save your login information so you don't have login each time you visit our website. If you turn off cookies, you will have to login each time you visit your website. _ **Sharing of Information**_  
CR does not share your user information. We will _never_ sell your information to any third party. When you complete surveys on our website for CR itself, we see the results as combined data. In surveys, user information is not given, instead it is in combined data. (i.e. 20% of our members are male)
