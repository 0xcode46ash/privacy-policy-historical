# Criminal Searches - Privacy Policy

### **General**

This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to the CriminalSearches.com web site (the “Site”). We understand and respect your concerns about privacy and the security of personal information, and we want you to feel comfortable using our Site. Maintaining the security of your personally identifiable information is important to us, as is giving you choices as to how that information is used and shared. We've created this Policy to provide you with information about data security and the privacy practices and policies applicable to the Site.

### **Types of Information We Collect**

The Site may collect general information, which refers to data that is generally not tied back to a specific individual. Unlike general information, personally identifiable information refers to data that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and email address, which may be collected in addition to the general data described above as provided below.

The general information we collect (either directly or through the use of a third-party tracking system) includes:

  * The IP address of the computer making the request (usually this is not your personal computer, but a computer used by your internet service provider or company network) 
  * The URL that is being requested 
  * The date and time of the request 
  * The browser type and operating system used to make the request 
  * The referring URL 



We also may collect aggregate search terms from search engine referrals to determine what information visitors are searching for when they find our Site. All of this general information is used to administer and improve our Site and diagnose any technical problems which may occur with our servers.

You have the option of creating an account with us in order to receive certain email (“Account”). In the event you create an Account, the Site may collect personal information by email or via our contact forms. Unless you give your consent, this information will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. 

### **Disclosing Your Information**

In general, we will not share your email address with any third party. However, if you specifically authorize us to provide your email address to a third party, we may do so in accordance with your instructions. We do not share any of your personally identifiable information with unrelated third parties for their own marketing purposes without your consent. However, we may disclose any of the information we collect to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf and companies that are related to us by common ownership or affiliated with us by common control. 

If we are acquired by or merge with another company, information will be transferred to the acquiring company. We may also share information to the extent we believe it is necessary to comply with the law (e.g., in response to subpoenas or government investigations), to assert or defend legal claims, and in order to investigate or respond to actual or suspected illegal activities, fraud, and threats of physical harm.

### **Your Right to Choose**

You have the ability to opt-out of certain types of information sharing and communications. You may opt-out of certain communications if you prefer that we not send you newsletters or other communications. If you exercise this opt-out right, we will not send you any further newsletters or other communications. If you receive an email from us you may exercise your right to opt-out of further email communications by following the opt-out link contained in our email.

### **Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors**

If our Site contains links to other sites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those other sites. We sometimes may offer content (e.g., promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. We will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if we will be providing this information to third parties.

### **Cookies**

A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server and stored by the user's Web browser so the information can later be read back from that browser. Cookies enable the browser to identify itself to the server, and allow the server to maintain an active "session" with an individual user. Cookies help the browser remember some specific information. We make limited use of cookies to make your visit to the Site easier, to improve the user experience and to identify individual users who have an Account with us. We also use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to gather statistical information about how our Site is used. This statistical information is not connected to any of your personal information.

### **Children's Privacy**

The Site and the Products are intended for use only by adults. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.

### **Changes to our Privacy Policy**

We want you to be fully informed about how we will use your information and protect your privacy. We may change this Privacy Policy in the future. You agree that we may notify you of changes in our Privacy Policy by posting a new or updated policy on the Site. You should periodically check this Privacy Policy for changes. Changes will take effect immediately upon posting on the Site. Your continued use of our Site following the posting of changes to this Policy will mean you accept those changes.

### **Notices**

We may send certain legally required notices or disclosures, including notices regarding our privacy policies, to you via email, and you consent to receiving any such consents or disclosures via email. It will be your responsibility to ensure that you have the necessary systems to allow you to receive email notices and disclosures from us.
