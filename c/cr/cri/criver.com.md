# Charles River Labs- On-line Privacy Statement

On-line Privacy Statement

Charles River respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us. Generally, you can browse through our Web site without giving us any information about yourself. When we do need personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.

**INFORMATION COLLECTED**

Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, personal interests, other information when needed to provide a service you requested.

When you browse our Web site, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously indicated that you wish Charles River to remember your login and password. We do not automatically collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address to give us an idea of which part of our Web site you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to any personal information unless you have logged in to our Web site. We do use a standard technology called “cookie” to collect information about how you use the site. Please go to “Web Browser Cookies” below for more information.

Charles River collects personal information when you register with Charles River for an account, when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, when you submit your personal information to Charles River for any other reason. When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of collection.

**INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETENTION AND USAGE**

_Server log files_

Our server log files are stored in a secure location, and can only be accessed by specified employees of Charles River. This information is kept indefinitely for historical purposes. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

_Database storage_

We make use of multiple databases to record and retrieve information sent to us through web forms (such as contact information, products and services requested, and any billing/payment information, etc.). This information is kept indefinitely for historical purposes. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.

_Web browser cookies_

We make use of a web browser cookie for the sole purpose of giving the visitors of our Web site the option to login quickly, without the hassle of putting in the username and password of their account. These cookies are created by the visitors browser, and are generally saved somewhere on the visitor's hard drive. Visitors have the ability to disable this feature at any time, either by unselecting "Automatically login from this computer" in their account information, or by disabling the use of cookies on their web browser. The cookie that we create will last for exactly one year from the time of creation, at which time a new cookie will be created upon the next login.

**INFORMATION SUBMITTED TO CHARLES RIVER THROUGH THE WEB SITE**

In some areas of our Web site you are offered the opportunity to submit information about yourself or your business.

Medical investigators who have an interest in working with Charles River in clinical studies may submit information to our Investigator Database. Information gathered via the Investigator Database is shared with our clients who are interested in conducting clinical studies in the therapeutic areas described by the registering investigator.

Patients participating in any clinical study managed by Charles River, or those acting on their behalf, who submit unsolicited information to a Web site, including personal information, may expect that we will share that information with our client who is responsible for the study, the medical investigator supervising the patient’s participation in the study, the institutional review board supervising the study and others who may have an interest in that particular patient’s experience in the clinical study. If a patient sends an unsolicited email to our Web site regarding a clinical study, we reserve the right to use or disclose the information contained in the email to third parties without seeking any additional consent from the patient.

Our Web site also contains forms for completion and submission, such as on our Contact Us page and Career Opportunities page. Information submitted _via_ these forms will be used for the purposes described on the page containing the form. You may expect that information submitted will be shared with the appropriate Charles River employees and agents necessary to take action on the information or request submitted. For example, resumes and information related to those seeking employment will be shared with the staff of the Charles River Human Resources Department and other Charles River employees involved in the hiring process.

**SHARING OF INFORMATION**

_Legal disclaimer_

Charles River will not transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except under limited conditions. Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. Charles River is a global company, your personal information may be shared with other Charles River offices or subsidiaries around the world. All such entities are governed by this Privacy Policy or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality and data transfer agreements. If you choose to provide us with your personal information, we will only transfer that information with your permission.

_Third party intermediaries_

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

_Business transitions_

In the event Charles River goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via a notice on our Web site prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.

**INFORMATION SECURITY**

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information _via_ the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry: SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.

The Web site is not intended or designed to attract children. We do not collect information or data on our Web site from children under the age of 13 nor do we desire to receive any information or data from children who visit our Web site.

**UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION**

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), we provide a way to correct and update users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done by selecting "Modify my account information" after logging in.

**COMMUNICATION**

_Automatic emails_

Our server will automatically send you an email at certain events during a web form submission. These events include but are not limited to first time account creation, forgotten password retrieval, order confirmation, etc. These emails are strictly used to keep the user well informed.

_Customer service_

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply _via_ email or phone.

**LINKS TO OTHER SITES**

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Charles River, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**NOTIFICATION OF POLICY CHANGE**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
