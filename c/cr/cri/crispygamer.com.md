## What We Collect and How We Use It

### User Account Data

A user account is required to comment.  When you sign up for a user account, you are required to provide:

  * user name
  * password
  * email address



When you post content on the site, the content will be identified under your user name.

Cookies, Web Beacons and Web Logs

We set a temporary session cookie whenever you visit the site. It will be deleted when you close your browser. If you merely read the site without logging in, you may instruct your browser to deny this cookie.

When you log into the site, we may set a persistent cookie, which will allow us to recognize you as an existing registered user and avoid the need to log into the site again. These cookies may last for up to 30 days. You may clear these cookies in your browser after a session in which you have logged in.

Our web pages may also contain an electronic file called a web beacon that allows us to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies.

Our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. We store this data in files called web logs. These web logs may include information such as your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the site you came from, the next site you visit and cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

None of the data collected through web beacons, cookies or web log data provides us with any personal information about you. We use this data on an aggregated basis to analyze how our users are interacting with the site and to customize your experience, such as by remembering your preferences and showing you content that you have tagged. If you are logged in to the site, we could associate information about your site usage that is collected by cookies, web beacons and web logs with your user account. However, we don't do this on an individual basis other than in cases of suspected abuse or illegal behavior. See our policy below about Investigating Abuse.

### Advertisers' Cookies

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our site. When you view ads on our site, a unique third-party cookie or cookies may be placed on your browser by the ad-serving company. In addition, the ad-serving companies may use web beacons to help manage and optimize our online advertising. The information collected by the ad-serving companies may be used to target ads to you on this site and on other sites that you visit.

### Information for Contests and Sweepstakes

If we offer a contest or sweepstakes, we may ask for additional information such as name, address, and phone number in order to provide the winner with their prize. We would not use that information for any other purpose unless we receive consent at the time you provide the information.

## Our Newsletters

If you register on the site, we may occasionally use your email address to send you a newsletter.

## Special Rules for Children

Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to become registered users.

Information Sharing  


### Third Parties

We will never provide your personally identifiable information to any third parties without your consent, except as described under "Our Service Provider" and "Investigating Abuse". We may provide third parties with aggregated or anonymous data about our users and their usage of our services that do not contain any individual's personally identifiable information.

### Our Service Providers

We may hire third-parties to help us provide our services to you. These services may include technical services, customer support, email message deployment, data processing and other services. It may be necessary for us to provide these third parties with some of you personal information in order for them to fulfill their services. For example, we use a third party to send our e-mail newsletters, so if you register, we will provide them your email address to provide you with the newsletter. These third parties do no retain, share or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information to providing services to us.

## Links to Other Sites

This web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us, including links in advertisements. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site to which you provide information.

## Investigating Potential Abuse

We may use any information provided to us by a user, including personally identifiable information, along with any data gathered from our web logs and from third parties to conduct investigations, and we may disclose this information to third parties, including law enforcement officials, investigators, or private parties seeking to protect and enforce their rights; if

  * we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, judicial proceeding, legal process, subpoena or warrant;
  * we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or
  * we believe that your actions violate the law or or threaten the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others.



## Business Transfer

If we sell all or a portion of our business, we may transfer some or all of your information as a part of the sale.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

If we make a material change in the way we use the personal data of our users, we will modify our privacy policy and will describe the changes under "Changes to the Privacy Policy". Your use of the website after any published change signifies your consent to the application of the revised policy to all information contributed before or after the date of those changes.
