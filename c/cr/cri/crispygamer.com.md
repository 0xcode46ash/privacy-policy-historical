## Crispy Gamer, Inc. Network Privacy Policy

Last updated January 1, 2008 

This Privacy Policy is applicable to all web sites (also, the "Website" or the "Service") operated by Crispy Gamer and domains owned by Crispy Gamer where this policy is displayed. This Privacy Policy is part of and is subject to our Terms of Use. All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning attributed thereto in the Terms of Use 

**Personally Identifiable Data Collected by Crispy Gamer**

We collect Personal Information when you voluntarily choose to provide such Personal Information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register on the Website, or use our services. For instance, when you register on the Website, we may ask for certain information, such as your first and last name, gamer name, email address, or mobile number. (You can access and update certain of your information by accessing the "Update My Account" Web page. If you have difficulty reaching this page, please visit our "Customer Feedback" Web page.) 

**Other Information Collected**

**Non-Identifiable Information**

During or after registration, or in connection with other interactive features such as entering a contest or promotion, Crispy Gamer may also ask for other information which cannot presently be used to specifically identify you, such as your personal interests (including favorite activity and destination), birth date, occupation, postal code, year of birth, gender, and income range. This information will be lined with your Personal Information. Crispy Gamer might collect this information through personal interest forms, surveys, or contests. We also ask whether you want to receive emails from us or special offers from partners. See the section on "Sharing of Data" for further detail. 

**IP Addresses and Browser Information**

Our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. 

When you visit our website, we send you a cookie. Cookies may be used in the following ways: 

  * To help us recognize you as a unique visitor (just a number) when you return to our website, to allow us to tailor content or advertisements to match your preferred interests, or to avoid showing you the same advertisements repeatedly.
  * To develop leads for our internal sales group and our business partners and provide direct marketing communications to you if you have explicitly consented to receive such communications. 
  * Do not attempt to harvest or collect any personal information, including account names, from the Website, nor use any means of communication provided by the Website (forums, blogs, user comments, etc.) for any commercial solicitation purposes.
  * To compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our site and to help us improve the structure of our website. We cannot identify you personally in this way.



Two types of cookies may be used on this website: session cookies (which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site) and persistent cookies (which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer, though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser, as well as delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features of our site if cookies are disabled/deleted. If you do not know how to disable or delete cookies for the browser you are using, you should select 'cookies' in the Help function of your browser to get more information. 

**Aggregated Personal Data**

In an effort to better understand and serve the users of our services, we may conduct research on our user demographics, interests, and behavior based on Personal Information and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Crispy Gamer may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents, and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Crispy Gamer may also disclose aggregated use statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for lawful purposes.

Crispy Gamer receives a commission for any purchases you make on partner sites. To help calculate these commissions, Crispy Gamer sends a tracking number to the partners. We do not provide Personal Information to our merchandise partners (except with your permission or as otherwise mentioned herein).

These third parties may serve ads about our products or services, or third party products or services in which, based on your Session Data, we or our business partners believe you may be interested. 

While we may share Session Data (as defined above) with third parties to help facilitate the serving of these ads, we do not share any Personal Information about you unless you give us permission to do so (which permission may be granted by declining to opt-out,) separate from any permission you provide when you register on the Website. These third parties may seek to use cookies and pixel tags, including those collected on our Website, to track Session Data about the ads you have seen and types of things in which you appear interested. These third parties may also use combined information about your visits to our Website and other sites in order to provide advertisements about related goods and services that may be of interest to you. 

When you click on a third party advertisers' link from our Website, you will be taken off of our Website and will enter the third party's site. We are not responsible for such third party's sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other site you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to that site, and may be very different from our Privacy Policy.

Periodically, Crispy Gamer introduces new email products or improves existing ones. If you are subscribed to an Crispy Gamer email product we may provide you with a trial subscription to the new product. You may unsubscribe from any of these products at any time. 

We use an email system that can individually track who opens an email (if you receive the email in HTML format) and who clicks on any link contained in an email. This is Personal Information, which we collect to: 

  * calculate how many people were interested in particular topics or particular links contained in an email product; and 
  * provide personalized services that are best suited to your interests



If you do not wish such information to be collected about you, you should unsubscribe from our emails. 

**Security**

Crispy Gamer employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access disclosure or modification of Personal Information. 

As a further security precaution, Crispy Gamer asks you to provide a password when you register on our Websites. You then have the option of storing that password on a cookie set on your computer. This way, you need not type in the password when you again access one of our sites. 

If the computer you are using is not for your sole use, after you have finished accessing an Crispy Gamer Web site, you should click on the this link, which will sign you off of the Web site. This action prevents other people from accessing your information. When you want to access member-only areas of Crispy Gamer's Web sites at another time, you will need to sign-in and type-in your password. You will have the option of having your password e-mailed to you if you have forgotten what it is. 

If you choose to contact the Crispy Gamer through our Website, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure. Crispy Gamer assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web. 

In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that many users cannot readily process encrypted e-mail. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted e-mail. We may also communicate with you via mobile phone. We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of any communications transmitted via mobile phone. 

**Changes in Privacy Policy**

As the nature of our business changes, Crispy Gamer may need to change its Privacy Policy. If this Privacy Policy is changed, this page will be updated. If there is a material change to this policy we will notify all users who are currently receiving email from Crispy Gamer. 

If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact.us/). Alternatively, you can mail Crispy Gamer at:
