# Privacy policy - Crikey

The website www.crikey.com.au and the Crikey Daily Mail email alert are published by Private Media Pty Ltd (ACN 102 933 362) (Private Media). In this policy, “us” “we” or “our” means Private Media.

This policy sets out how Private Media collects and handles your personal information.

For the purposes of this policy, “personal information” has the meaning given to it in the Privacy Act 1988 (the Act). In general terms, it is any information that can be used to personally identify you. This may include your name, age, gender, postcode and contact details (including phone numbers and email addresses) and possibly financial information, including your credit card, direct debit or PayPal account information. If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.

## 1   Privacy Policy Purpose

Private Media takes its obligations under the Australian Privacy Principles as contained in the Act very seriously and has implemented practices, procedures and systems to ensure we comply with those laws.

We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality and security of your personal information and managing it in an open and transparent way.

## 2   Using a pseudonym or being anonymous

You will need to provide us with accurate personal details when you interact with Private Media, otherwise we may be unable to provide you with our services in the way that you propose and in some circumstances – at all. You may however use a pseudonym during some interactions and where it is not necessary for us to identify you.

We may also collect your personal information over the telephone, through correspondence (whether by letter, fax or email), on our forms, when you enter into agreements with us or through our website.

## 4   Dealing with unsolicited personal information

If we receive your personal information from a third party without having asked you for it, then within a reasonable time, we will determine whether we could have collected it in the ways outlined in paragraph 3 above.

(a) destroy the information; or

(b) ensure that it is de-identified.
