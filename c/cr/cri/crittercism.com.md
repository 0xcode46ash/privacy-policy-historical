#### CRITTERCISM, INC. PRIVACY POLICY

**OVERVIEW**

Crittercism, Inc. takes your privacy seriously. We recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy describes the collection of your personal information by Crittercism from our website located at http://www.crittercism.com, including without limitation all sub-domains thereof on which this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively, the “Site”). This Privacy Policy also describes our use and disclosure of such information. By accessing or using our Site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into theÂ [Crittercism Terms of Service](https://www.crittercism.com/tos-v3.html)Â and subject to the provisions of the Crittercism Terms of Service. The terms “Crittercism,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Crittercism, Inc. The terms “you” and “your” refer to the user accessing or using the Site.

The term “personal information” as used in this Privacy Policy refers to personally identifiable information that specifically identifies an individual (such as an individual’s first and last name, address, telephone number, e- mail address, credit card or other account number), and information about that individual or such individual’s activities or preferences when such information is directly linked to personally identifying information. Personal information does not include “aggregate information” or other non-personally identifiable information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed. We may collect, use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes.
