# International Crisis Group - privacy

## Use of information collected

**Online**

Crisis Group collects your contact details if you send us a message, if you subscribe to our website or if you make a donation on-line. Your details will only be used to send you email notifications of Crisis Group reports and briefings, weekly update emails, and to send you occasional emails advising of changes to Crisis Group's website or requesting donations. They will not be supplied to any other organisation or used for any other purpose without your consent. 

This site does not provide facilities for the secure transmission of information across the Internet. Users should be aware that there are inherent risks transmitting information across the Internet. 

**Offline**

Crisis Group stores contact details provided by you off-line (e.g. business cards), and occasionally when provided by your friends and colleagues, in order to send you our reports and briefings by email or post. Your details will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided them and to send you occasional requests for donations. 

In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to provide your address to mailing houses (which may be located in jurisdictions which do not provide adequate data protection) in order for our report to be sent to you. Such mailing houses are forbidden to use your contact details for any purpose other than the provision of mailing services to Crisis Group and are obliged to keep your information confidential. However, your contact details will not be supplied to any other organisation or used for any other purpose without your consent.

## Security

Personal data, whether collected on-line or off, will be stored in a secure server located in Belgium and will be password protected.

## This website

When you look at this website, the Internet Service Provider for Crisis Group makes a record of your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes:

  * your server address 
  * your top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc) 
  * the pages you accessed and documents downloaded 
  * the previous site you have visited 
  * the type of browser you are using. 



## Access to information collected 

Crisis Group will not make an attempt to identify users. However, in the unlikely event of an investigation, a law enforcement agency or other government agency may exercise its legal authority to inspect our Internet Service Provider's logs. 

## Cookies

This website only uses session cookies and only during a search query of the web site. Our Internet Service Provider has assured us that no cookies are employed on this web site except for those associated with the search engine. The website statistics for this site are generated from the web logs as outlined above. 

Upon closing your browser the session cookie set by this web site is destroyed and no personal information is maintained which might identify you should you visit our web site at a later date. 

Cookies can be either "persistent" or "session" based. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer, contain an expiration date, and may be used to track your browsing behaviour upon return to the issuing web site. Session cookies are short-lived, are used only during a browsing session, and expire when you quit your browser. 

## Donations

The secure website for donations is run by the Belgian company Ogone and Crisis Group does not have access to financial data (such as credit card details) which you will be asked to provide. Ogone has its own privacy policy for which Crisis Group is not responsible (see [www.ogone.be](http://www.ogone.be/)). 

It is optional to complete the address and phone fields in the donation box, but completing these boxes will assist us in maintaining our records, and in contacting you if there are problems with the donation. Please note that we will keep your information private, and will not provide your information to any other organisation or person.
