# Privacy Policy - International Crisis Group

This statement comprises the privacy policy of the International Crisis Group (“Crisis Group”) as it pertains to the [http://www.crisisgroup.org](http://www.crisisgroup.org/) website (the “Website”).  We welcome you to use the Website, which can be accessed and browsed without the need to submit any contact details or other personally-identifiable information (“Personal Information”).  We strive to make sure that any Personal Information that you do provide to us is protected and secure.  Our privacy policy tells you how we treat the information about you that we receive through this Website.

**THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT   **

Crisis Group collects your Personal Information when you send us a message, subscribe to our website, or make a donation online.  Your Personal Information will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it (e.g., to send you email notifications of Crisis Group reports and briefings, as well as weekly update emails), and to send you occasional emails advising you of changes to Crisis Group’s website or requesting donations.  It will not be supplied to any other organisation or used for any other purpose without your consent.  Specifically, Crisis Group collects your Personal Information on the Website as follows:

**Contacting Crisis Group:**   If you choose to contact Crisis Group through the Website, we will collect the data you provide to us voluntarily on the contact submission form, which includes your name and email address.  We will use this information to respond to your inquiry. 

**Email Newsletters:**   If you choose to sign up for our email newsletters, we will collect the data you provide to us voluntarily on the data forms, which includes your email address.  We will use this information to send you weekly email newsletters, email notifications of Crisis Group reports and briefings, and to send you occasional emails advising of changes to Crisis Group’s website or requesting donations.     

**Registration with Crisis Group:**   If you choose to register with Crisis Group to obtain full access to Crisis Group’s reports and briefings, we will collect the data you provide to us voluntarily on the data forms, which includes your name, email address, country, organisation type, and selected password.  We will use this information to send you email notifications of Crisis Group reports and briefings, including Crisis Group’s monthly bulletin _CrisisWatch_ , and to send you occasional emails advising of changes to Crisis Group’s website or requesting donations, if you requested such information when registering. 

**Donations:**   Crisis Group uses a third party, Ogone, to process online donations to Crisis Group made electronically through the Website.  Any Personal Information you submit through the “Donations” section of the Website (including your name, email address, amount of donation, as well as optional information including your postal address and telephone number) to make an online donation will be kept private and will not be provided to any other organization or person.  We use this information to maintain our records and contact you if there are problems with the donation. 

Any Personal Information you submit through Ogone’s secure donations website is provided directly by you to Ogone and will be used by Ogone to process your transaction.  Personal Information provided by you to Ogone is subject to [Ogone’s privacy policy](http://www.ogone.com/ncol/privacy_site1.asp).  We do not control Ogone’s privacy policy and practices, and we do not have access to Personal Information that you provide to Ogone.  Ogone will provide Crisis Group with certain Personal Information about you (including your name, billing address, email address, telephone number, donation amount and relationship to Crisis Group, but not your credit card number) when you choose to make an online donation to Crisis Group through the Website (unless you request that your donation remain anonymous, in which case Crisis Group will not receive your name and contact information).  Crisis Group will use this information to produce and send to you an acknowledgement letter.

**Offline Personal Information Submissions:**   Crisis Group stores Personal Information provided by you offline (e.g., business cards), and occasionally when provided by your friends and colleagues, in order to send you our reports and briefings by email or post.  Your Personal Information will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it and to send you occasional emails advising you of changes to Crisis Group’s website or requesting donations.  It will not be supplied to any other organisation or used for any other purpose without your consent. 

In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to provide your address to mailing houses (which may be located in jurisdictions which do not provide adequate data protection) in order for our report to be sent to you.  By voluntarily providing us with your Personal Information, you are giving your consent to the transfer of your Personal Information to mailing houses in such jurisdictions strictly for the purposes described in this policy.  However, your contact details will not be supplied to any other organisation or used for any other purpose without your consent. 

**WITH WHOM YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED**

Crisis Group will not share your Personal Information with any other company or third party without your permission, except in the following circumstances:  (i) as set forth above, (ii) in response to a subpoena or when we are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or other legal obligation; (iii) in response to a law enforcement agency’s request; (iv) to protect the security or confidentiality of our records; (v) in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with our rights, or (vi) in the event Crisis Group goes through a reorganisation (e.g., a merger into another organisation), in which case you will be notified via a prominent notice on the Website of any such transfer of your Personal Information.

**OPTING OUT**

If you have provided Crisis Group with your email address to receive email newsletters, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of receiving such emails by clicking on the link provided in the email.  You may then choose to opt out by following the instructions on the Website’s [Unsubscription Request page](https://web.archive.org/en/Newsletter/Unsubscribe.aspx).

Please note that we will endeavor to implement your opt-out requests within a reasonable time, although for a short time you may continue to receive the email newsletter(s) to which you have subscribed based on information released prior to the implementation of your request.  Please also note that after your request is implemented, you may continue to receive information directly related to any online donations you make through the Website.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, for statistical purposes. 

**Cookies**

Like most websites, the Website may place a “cookie,” or small text file, in the browser of a visitor’s computer.  This cookie will assign a user a unique number that allows Crisis Group to save information so that the information does not need to be re-entered.  Cookies can be either “persistent” or “session” based.  Persistent cookies are stored on your computer, contain an expiration date, and may be used to track your browsing behavior upon return to the issuing web site.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.  Session cookies are short-lived, are used only during a browsing session, and expire when you quit your browser.

The Website uses both session cookies and persistent cookies.  We only use session cookies during a search query of the Website to provide you with a more customised browsing experience while you are on the Website.  Upon closing your browser, the session cookie set by the Website is destroyed.  The Website uses persistent cookies to store your password, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.  Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on the Website. 

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.  (For instructions on how to configure your browser, please consult your browser’s “Help” menu.)  If you choose not to allow us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be restricted from some pages and services on the Website.

Our site may contain links to other sites that may use cookie technology.  We do not have access to, or control over, these cookies. 

**SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**  

Crisis Group uses reasonable precautions to protect your Personal Information and to store it securely.  The Website does not provide facilities for the secure transmission of information across the Internet.  If you choose to make an electronic donation to Crisis Group, however, you will be transferred to a secure website, run by the Belgian company Ogone, where the donation process will be completed.  Please refer to the above section “Donations” for further information concerning the electronic donations process.  Personal Information, whether collected online or off-line, will be stored in a server located in Belgium and will be password protected.  The server on which we store Personal Information is kept in a reasonably secure environment.  You should be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
