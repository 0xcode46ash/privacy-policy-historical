This privacy statement covers the site www.crimsontrace.com. Crimson Trace Corporation collects user e-mails addresses only for the purposes of conducting its own marketing and communication research. No further information is collected, nor is any information whatsoever shared with third parties.

If you do not wish to receive electronic mailings, you may discontinue receiving these by sending your request to [customer@crimsontrace.com](mailto:customer@crimsontrace.com).

  
Information Collection  
Crimson Trace Corporation is the sole owner of the information collected on www.crimsontrace.com. Crimson Trace Corporation collects information from our users at a few different points on our Web site.

Log Files  
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use a tracking utility called Urchin that uses log files to analyze user movement.

Legal Disclaimer  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

We DO NOT Share Personal Information with Third Parties

Business Transitions  
In the event Crimson Trace Corporation goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.

Choice/Opt-out  
Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an "opt-out" mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.

Users who no longer wish to receive our promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by sending an unsubscribe request to [customer@crimsontrace.com](mailto:customer@crimsontrace.com). 

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.

Surveys & Contests  
Our site occasionally requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information such as name and shipping address, and demographic information such as zip code. Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Anonymous survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

Security  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. The servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.

Notification of Changes  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
