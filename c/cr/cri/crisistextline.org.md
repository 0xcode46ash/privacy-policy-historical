# Crisis Text Line Hotline, Privacy Policy | Crisis Text Line

Last Updated: July 31, 2013

## Abstract

At Crisis Text Line (“We”, “Us”, “Our”), Our goal is to advantage young people in crisis. Simply, this means that We will protect your information in accordance with current laws and best practices for sensitive health information.

Your privacy and security are very important to Us. This privacy policy describes what information We collect on the Crisis Text Line Hotline (“Hotline”) and how We use, transfer and store your information after We collect it. This policy will inform you if We disclose that information to anyone, and what choices you have in how We use that information. Please  familiarize yourself with Our privacy policies. If you have any questions, contact Us at info@crisistextline.org.

## Your Consent and Changes in Privacy Policy

By using the Hotline, you agree to the following terms and conditions outlined in this Privacy Policy. Crisis Text Line may change these terms and conditions from time to time, so please consult these terms and conditions regularly for any such changes. When We change the policy in a substantive way, We will post a notice on Our website along with the updated Privacy Policy.

## Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information

“Personally Identifiable Information” is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact you, such as your full name, home address or date of birth. During your use of the Hotline you may be prompted, but never required, to provide Personally Identifiable Information, including but not limited to, your zip code and email address.

While We may collect Personally Identifiable Information, We will not sell or license to any third party any Personally Identifiable Information We receive from you, and will not share it with any third parties except as noted below.

Crisis Text Line uses the information it collects about you to, among other things, improve Our service, contact you if you request Us to, provide anonymous reporting internally and fulfill your requests, including but not limited to referrals to other crisis hotlines or mental health services.

The following section provides examples of the types of Personally Identifiable Information the Hotline may collect and how We may use it.

### What Personally Identifiable Information We Collect

  * When you contact the Hotline, We may collect information including your name, phone number and email address.

  * When you contact the Hotline about a friend, family member, or other person in need of Our services, We may collect the information you provide about those people such as name and phone number.

  * In situations where you or someone else is in danger or in need of emergency help, We may ask for your current location, or the current location of the person in danger.




### How We Use Your Personally Identifiable Information

  * We use Personally Identifiable Information to help Us develop, deliver, and improve Our products, services, content, and advertising.

  * If you choose to receive follow-up email messages or text messages from Us, the Personally Identifiable Information We collect may be used to notify you of relevant events and opportunities. If you no longer wish to receive messages, you may opt out at any time by updating your preferences (link).

  * Occassionally, We may use your Personally Identifiable Information to send you important notices, such as notifications about local extreme weather events or other relevant emergency notifications, and changes to Our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is essential to your interaction with Crisis Text Line, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.

  * We may also use Personally Identifiable Information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Crisis Text Line’s products, services, and communications.

  * We may also use your information to help Us personalize your experience with Us and to operate, maintain and improve the features and functionality of Our service.




## Collection and Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information

We also collect non-Personally Identifiable Information, which is data that cannot be directly used to identify or contact you. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose, including but not limited to disclosing to sponsors, supporters, and other third parties, to generate support for Crisis Text Line, inform its mission and its services, or as required by law.

Below are examples of non-Personally Identifiable Information that We collect and how We may use it:

  * We may collect information such as age, gender, language, zip code, area code, and the time zone where a phone is being used to contact the Hotline to better understand visitor behavior and improve Our products, services and advertising.

  * We also may collect information regarding visitor activities on Our Hotline, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Hotline, length of conversation, and other data. This information is aggregated and helps Us determine usage levels of different Hotline services, and to conduct other internal research.




For this Privacy Policy, if non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated or combined in such a way that it can be used to directly identify or contact you, it will be treated as Personally Identifiable Information for as long as it remains aggregated or combined.

## Disclosure to Third Parties

At times We may make certain Personally Identifiable Information available to strategic partners that work with Us to provide products, services, and marketing.

### Participating Crisis Centers

We operate the Hotline in conjunction with participating crisis centers (“CCs”), including but not limited to(the network providers). The CCs provide trained staff and/or volunteers to help you during Hotline sessions and trained supervisors to help monitor Hotline sessions. Any information that you share during a Hotline session will be viewed by the one or more trained staff and/or volunteers assisting you, and may also be viewed by one or more supervisors from a CC for quality control purposes. Hotline sessions may also be viewed by Crisis Text Line staff.

Also, any information that you shared during a previous Hotline session may be viewed by the one or more trained staff and/or volunteers assisting you, and may also be viewed by one or more supervisors form a CC for quality control purposes.

If you provide feedback through an anonymous feedback survey before or following your session, that feedback may be shared with the trained volunteer assisting you, and with personnel at Crisis Text Line and the participating CCs.

### Other Crisis Centers

If you would like to receive crisis support from other hotlines, you may choose to have Us pass your personal information to such organizations; please note that whenever you choose to have Us pass such personal information to another organization, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of such information. We do not control the privacy policies of others. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

### Others

We may share information with other affiliated third parties for the purpose of helping Us do Our work, to advantage young people in crisis, or to enter into one or more agreements with third parties to provide services to Us in connection with the Hotline. These organizations may provide services such as information processing, managing and enchancing customer data, providing customer service, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys, and may include but are not limited to academic institutions, research institutes, and policy makers. In most cases, this information will be provided in aggregate and anonymized. Exceptions include but are not limited to those groups which meet the requirements and complete documentation necessary for a restricted access, enclave access, or business associate agreement. These groups do not share your personal information or use it for any purpose other than as instructed by Us. These groups are obligated to protect your information.

### Legal Processes

We do not publish, sell, share, or rent information about you in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. However, We, including trained volunteers, staff and CCs may disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances. We may be required to (and you authorize Us to) reveal any information about you that We possess to law enforcement or other government officials as We, in Our sole discretion, believe is necessary or appropriate, in connection with the investigation of a crime, mandatory reporting laws, fraud, intellectual property infringement, or other activity that is illegal, or may expose Us, or you, to liability.

For example, some states require Us to record and report information regarding the abuse of someone less than 18 years of age, or vulnerable or disabled adults, including persons over 60 years of age, or persons who are in danger of committing suicide. If you convey such circumstances, and provide information that could lead Us to identify your name and location, We may have to record such information and provide it to the appropriate authorities. Also, if you are under 13 years old, We, or the trained volunteer, staff or CC may be required to disclose whatever information you have provided to the appropriate authorities.

Trained staff and volunteers are located across the United States, and may not be licensed in your state or trained in your state’s law. The laws of the trained volunteer’s state may apply to your communications with that trained volunteer. The volunteer’s state laws may not protect your communications to the same degree, or in the same way, as the laws of your state. For instance, your state might recognize a privilege to communications with the Hotline — meaning that the state may allow you to keep such communications private — but the volunteer’s state might not recognize such a privilege. It is possible that a court of law will not keep private, and may require Us to reveal, information that you provide during your Hotline session.

Also, We may disclose information about you if We determine that such a disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce Our terms and conditions or protect Our services or users.

## How We Protect Your Personal Information

Crisis Text Line cares about the security of your personal information. We take precautions, including administrative, technical, and physical measures, to protect your personal information from loss, theft, and misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We store all information on a secure server that is only accessible by Crisis Text Line employees, contractors, and third parties pursuant to the terms described above.

We employ different security techniques to protect your personal information from unauthorized access by users inside and outside of Our organization, including standard encryption practices. However, “perfect security” does not exist anywhere on the Internet or for texting (SMS) data.. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE TAKE APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURES OF INFORMATION, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE HOTLINE WILL NEVER BE DISCLOSED IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH THIS POLICY, AND MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SUFFICIENCY OF Our SECURITY MEASURES.

Always be careful and responsible regarding your personal information. We are not responsible for, and cannot control, the use by others of any information which you provide or divulge to others, purposefully or inadvertently, including your phone number.

## Retention of Personal Information

We will retain your personal information for the duration required to fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law. You may request that we delete some of your personal information as described below.

## Access to Personal Information

You may request that we delete your Personally Identifiable Information, such as last name, phyiscal address, email address, or phone number by emailing Us at [info@crisistextline.org](mailto:info@crisistextline.org). This does not include non-Personally Identifiable Information, which cannot be used to identify or contact you.

We will make Our best effort to process requests promptly, but may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require unreasonable technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of you or others, are otherwise impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local laws. Requests for access, correction or deletion can be made by emailing Us at info@crisistextline.org.

## Children Under Thirteen (13) Years of Age

If you are under thirteen (13) years of age, do not send any information about yourself to the Hotline. We do not knowingly collect any Personally Identifiable Information from children under thirteen (13) years of age unless the collection complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. If the Hotline discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided the Hotline with Personally Identifiable Information in a way that does not comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, the Hotline will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that child’s Personally Identifiable Information. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided Us with Personally Identifiable Information through crisistextline.org or the Hotline without verifiable parental consent, he or she should contact Crisis Text Line at [info@crisistextline.org](mailto:info@crisistextline.org).

## Third-Party Information Collectors

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses the use and disclosure of information that We collect from you. Our websites, products, applications and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, applications and services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties – for example, if you use the Hotline, We may refer you to a local mental health center.

If you disclose your information to third parties, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of such information. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others. We disclaim all responsibility for compliance with the privacy policies of third party hotlines and websites, and strongly urge all users to review such privacy policies.

## International Users

The Hotline is operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide will be collected in or transferred to the United States. By using the Hotline, participating in any of Our services and/or providing Us with your information, you consent to this transfer.

## Our Organizational Commitment to Your Privacy

To make sure We’re doing everything We can to secure your personal information, We communicate Our privacy and security guidelines to Crisis Text Line employees and employees at Our third party service providers and stringently enforce privacy safeguards within the organization.
