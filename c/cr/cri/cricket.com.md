# PRIVACY STATEMENT | Communicate.com Network

Your Privacy

  
Communicate.com is committed to our visitors and to protecting their privacy. We value our visitors and endeavor to create an enjoyable and valuable experience when visiting our network of sites. The following Privacy Statement applies to all visitors to the Communicate.com network of sites, and to all referrals made by our visitors. 

What Information We Collect

The Communicate.com network of sites currently asks visitors for information in a variety of ways. First, there is a general survey posted that does not require the submission of any personal information. Second, when you enter our contest, we ask for your name, email address, age range, gender, country and zip/postal code to qualify as an entry. Third, we ask general interest questions in our survey questionnaire as a means for visitors to obtain additional entries into the contest. 

How the Customer Information is Used

Information collected from the contest entry, survey questions and through any other forum helps us develop the design, content, and features of our sites. We may also use the information we collect to email you every now and then about upcoming contests and developments on the sites within our network or news and/or promotions from our partners or to market new services and/or products that we believe will be of interest to you, in conjunction with our business partners. 

Customer Protection

Communicate.com takes all measures to provide a safe environment with security procedures in place to ensure proper storage and careful retrieval of information so that your personal information is secure and protected. 

What We Do with Your Information

Your privacy is a very sensitive subject for us and we take it very seriously. So our Privacy Statement is pretty simple. We will not sell, barter, give away or rent your personal information to any third party outside of Communicate.com Inc. and its properties. Communicate.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third parties, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.
