> **Spam Policy**
>      
> Spam is flooding the Internet with many copies of the same message, in an attempt to force the message on people who would not otherwise choose to receive it. Email spam targets individual users with direct mail messages and costs the sender very little to send. Most of the costs are paid for by the recipient or the carriers rather than by the sender. 
> 
> The Crime Library does not condone the use of spam and the sending of unsolicited email in any form, nor do we control other web sites involvement and/or practices in this area.
