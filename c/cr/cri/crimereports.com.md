Personal Information

When you request a service or information, place an order, submit feedback or participate in a forum or survey, we may need to ask you for personal information such as your name, address, email address and telephone number.

Once we receive your request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove your name from the contact list. If you wish to update any of your personal information, please contact us at such email address, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to update your contact information accordingly. Please be aware, however, even if we update your personal information in our contact list, or we remove such information, it may still be stored in other databases (including those kept for archival purposes) and may still be used to compile aggregated or demographic information for supply to third parties in accordance with this privacy policy. It is our policy to not provide information that identifies you personally to a third party without your permission, except to process or fulfill your requests, or as otherwise set forth in this privacy policy.

We may share this information with third parties, but only in aggregate statistical form that includes no personally identifying information.

In all instances, we will cooperate fully when required by law to provide information regarding visitors.
