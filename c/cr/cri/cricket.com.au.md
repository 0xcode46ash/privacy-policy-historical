CRICKET AUSTRALIA PRIVACY POLICY (at 7 July 2005)

This privacy policy relates to the collection of personal information by Cricket Australia.

Cricket Australia respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This document sets out our policies on collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information.

This policy does not apply to third party suppliers, (sponsors, licensees and other partners) who carry out specialised activities for us. However, whilst your personal information may be supplied to these third parties to enable them to perform their agreed activities, we ensure that they are aware of their obligations under the Privacy Act.

The type of personal information we may collect from you generally comprises name, address, age group, gender, contact details (including phone, fax and email) and information, collected for the following purposes, in the course of our business:  
• personal information of participants in cricket matches and cricket competitions played under our auspices;  
• personal information of participants in corporate hospitality and events, so that we can analyse our market and, unless advised otherwise, for direct marketing purposes;  
• personal information of participants in our coaching clinics to contact in the event of an emergency, for insurance purposes and, unless advised otherwise, for direct marketing purposes;  
• personal information of individuals who receive priority notice of ticket sales, so that we can provide that notice;  
• personal information of subscribers to our on-line newsletters, so that we can service those subscribers and, unless advised otherwise, for marketing purposes; and  
• personal information of customers of our on-line shop, so that we can service those customers and, unless advised otherwise, for marketing purposes.  
Where possible, at the time we collect personal information we:  
• advise the individual of the relevant purpose;  
• obtain the individual’s consent to the proposed use of their personal information; and  
• give the individual the option to opt out of receiving offers, invitations or other information.

We take steps to make sure that personal information is stored securely. These steps include:  
• storing paper records in a physically secure place;  
• using appropriate access controls in relation to our information systems; and  
• storing electronic information in a protected secure database which is unreachable via the internet;

We use the personal information we collect and store for the purposes we have either advised or for which we have obtained consent.

We also carry out research using personal information from time to time, in order to improve our business and our products and services. The analysis is carried out using aggregated information, not information relating to specific individuals.

We may also use certain personal information from time to time, where lawful to do so, to communicate with customers and potential customers about product or service offerings in which they may be interested. However, each time we contact a customer in this way, we ask whether they wish not to receive any further such communications. If a customer advises us that they do not wish to receive communications of that nature, we comply with that request.

Except as described in this policy or when legally required to do so we will not disclose or share your personal information.

For further information about Cricket Australia’s use of personal information, or if at any time your details change or you would like to request access to the information we have collected about you or if you do not wish to receive offers or other information, please contact Cricket Australia’s Privacy Officer by emailing [privacy@cricket.com.au.](mailto:privacy@cricket.com.au).
