# PRIVACY STATEMENT

Criteria Corp.

Please read our Privacy Policy carefully - by using our web sites or registering your interest in us online, you consent to these terms (including as amended from time to time). If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, you are prohibited from using our Sites.

We collect certain information through our websites, located at [http://www.criteriacorp.com](http://www.criteriacorp.com/) and [http://www.ondemandassessment.com](http://www.ondemandassessment.com/) (our "Websites"). This page (this "Privacy Policy") lays out our policies and procedures surrounding the collection and handling of any such information that identifies an individual user or that could be used to contact or locate him or her ("Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII").

This Privacy Policy applies only to our Websites. It does not apply to any third party site or service linked to our Websites or recommended or referred by our Websites or by our staff. It does not apply to any other website or online service operated by our company, or to any of our offline activities.

* **PII We Collect**

We collect Personally Identifiable Information from customers and users to our pre-employment testing service HireSelectÂ®. Job applicants provide name and email and may be requested by our customers to upload a resume; Customers provide business contact information including name, job title, organization, email, address, and telephone.

Customers who have chosen to pay via credit card, may provide credit card information via a secure form to our credit card processor authorize.net; we do not have access to that number and it is not saved on our servers.

In an optional section, we request certain demographic data from job applicants, including age, sex, gender, education level, and primary language. This is entirely optional and the employer never knows who has or has not provided any demographic data. This data is requested for two reasons: First, so that we can continually monitor our tests to ensure they are non-discriminatory and EEOC compliant and second to be able to assist clients, upon their request, with monitoring their hiring process to ensure their employee selection processes are non-discriminatory. If we disclose demographic data to employers, we do so only in aggregate or anonymous form such that it cannot be reasonably identified with any particular individual.

We may collect PI from third parties. For example, we may obtain information from our customers about a particular job applicant.

* **Our Use of PII**

We use your Personally Identifiable Information to create your account, to operate, maintain and provide you the features of our service, to communicate with you about products and services you've purchased, to offer you additional products and services, and to bill you. We also use that information to the extent necessary to enforce our Websites terms of service and to prevent harm to persons or property.

* **Protection of PII**

Our hosting provider employs data security tools to protect Personally Identifiable Information. Unfortunately, even with these measures, we cannot guarantee the security of PII.
