**Privacy Policy**  
CPI respects and understands the importance of privacy and security for our online customers.

CPI sometimes hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as sending newsletters and performing statistical analysis with regard to the use of our website. We only provide those companies with the information that they need to provide us with such services, and we prohibit them from using that information for any other purpose.

Except as otherwise stated in this policy, the personal information you provide on this site will not be shared with any third parties, although CPI reserves the right to share such information with its affiliates and subsidiaries without your permission. In addition, CPI reserves the right to disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary.
