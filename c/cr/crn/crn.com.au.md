The Authority Network will not sell, trade, give or rent any personally identifiable information obtained from you to a third party unless you consent. 

It is our policy to allow our users to provide as much - or as little - personal information to us as they feel comfortable doing. As a user or customer of the Authority Network we strive to provide you with some important rights: 

  1. Decide what personally identifiable information we collect.   


  2. Our total commitment to your privacy.   


  3. Not to receive e-mail from The Authority Network you have not consented to receive. 

**Information Gathered**

Unless you specifically tell us, the Authority Network will never know who you are. 

We hope that, like many of our users and customers, you will want to provide information about yourself to the Authority Network because it will help us to make our sites and services more valuable to you. 

The choice of how much personally identifiable information about yourself you disclose to the Authority Network is left completely up to you, our valued customer. But however you choose to interact with the Authority Network, you have our commitment to your privacy, as stated above. 

There will be certain developed areas that will only be restricted useage based on user information (eg Any facility to use our sites to privately sell something - as a duty of care we need as much as possiblt to protect our audience of consumers although ultimately it is a case of caveat emptor - buyer beware) 

**What information does the Authority Network gather?**

  * If you are comfortable providing us with information about yourself, enhanced services, like forums, become available to you, but in most cases it will not be possible for us to offer them to anonymous users. 
  * In some instances where we are selling products and services to you we require financial information as well as personal information. All the information we gather is stored on a protected secure site and never shared with anyone. 
  * We track traffic patterns throughout sites. We may use a feature of your browser called a "cookie" to assign a "User ID." Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out your identity or the identities' of any of our users, it only identifies your computer to our servers when you visit our site. 

  * Companies placing advertising on our sites and the sites of other web publishers may have the ability to assign a different cookie to you by a process that the Authority Network does not control. However as cookies don't identify individuals (you'll just be a number to them), companies will not know who you are - and The Authority Network will not tell them. 

**Why do we gather the information and how will we use it?**

The Authority Network aims to provide you with better services and more compelling reasons to come back and visit our sites: 

  * In the future, we may use the information you provide us with to provide personalised portions of our sites to you that are intended to provide just the information you are interested in receiving. 
  * We analyse what our users and customers like and don't like about the content, products and services on Authority Network sites so that we can constantly improve them for your use. 
  * In the future, we may also use information you have given us to help focus the advertisements that are shown on our sites, hopefully to make them of more interest to you. 
  * We develop summary - not individual - reports for our advertisers. An example of a summary report might be "9,000 people clicked through the main news headlines of the site." The people that help make it possible for the Authority Network to provide sites for free - our advertisers - use this information to determine how effective their advertising investments might be through the site. We do not tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked through the site and do not sell, trade or rent them any of your personal information. 
  * Occasionally, we will send you e-mail communications to provide information which we think you will find useful, including information about new products and services from The Authority Network. It is our policy only to send e-mail to customers who give us permission to do so. In every such e-mail, we will also have instructions on how you may unsubscribe from the e-mail list so that you will not receive any future e-mails if you do not wish to - see the "Opt-out Policy " below. In some instances there may be advertisments in the emails. 

**Security. Is my information safe?**

When you place orders or access your membership information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the data we collect is protected by firewalls against unauthorized access. 

**Opt-In/Opt-Out policy**

The Authority Network puts control over communications directed to you where it belongs, in your hands: 

  * We only send our e-mail newsletters to users who ask to receive them.   

  * Once you are on the list - you can easily get off. Each e-mail newsletter you receive has a simple unsubscribe link at the bottom. simply click and send.   

  * If you change or move e-mail addresses please let us know so we can redirect your e-mail to your new address. 

**Your consent**

By using our sites, you consent to the collection and use of this information by The Authority Network. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it.
