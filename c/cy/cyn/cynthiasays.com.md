#### **III. Personally Identifiable Website Activity Monitoring**

In the case of visitors to our website, who either (i) submit inquiries to us via web forms or (ii) have been directed to our website after clicking on a link in marketing e-mail from us, we may use software to connect such information submitted to us (such as e-mail addresses and contact information) with the IP address and cookie on the computer that has submitted the information to us (see "Cookies” above for a further description of cookies).

#### **IV. Non-personally identifiable information**

Via web server logs, for example, we may monitor statistics such as: the number of people that visit our site, which page(s) are visited on our site, from which domain our visitors come (e.g., aol.com, hotmail.com, etc.), and which browsers people use to visit our site (e.g., Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, etc.).

We may use this information in the administration of this website, to improve the website's usability, and for marketing purposes.

We use cookies on this website. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.

We may send a cookie which may be stored on by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of this website, to improve the website's usability and for marketing purposes. We may also use that information to recognize your computer when you visit our website, and to personalize our website for you. Our advertisers may also send you cookies.

Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookie by clicking "Tools", "Internet Options", "Privacy", and selecting "Block all cookies" using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.

**(3) Information about your browser software's user agent string.**

When you visit a web page, your browser sends the user agent string to the server hosting the site that you are visiting. This string indicates which browser you are using, its version number, and details about your system, such as operating system and version. The web server can then use this information to provide content that is tailored for your specific browser. The user agent string is anonymous data that is not indicative of and cannot be traced to an individual without the cooperation of their Internet Service Provider. HiSoftware only collects this non-personal data to accelerate resolution of specific support inquiries. HiSoftware may also use aggregate data about user’s preferred browsers to inform future product development efforts.
