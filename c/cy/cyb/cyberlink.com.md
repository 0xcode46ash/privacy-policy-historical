It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, CyberLink may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail address, telephone and facsimile numbers, birthday, and other personal information. When ordering products or services on the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number.

**'Cookies' and the CyberLink Website**

Like most corporate websites, we do use a variety of methods to track usage of our website. The CyberLink website does use 'cookies' to monitor your visits to our site and to identity CyberLink registered members. By placing a 'cookie' on your hard drive, we are able to recognize return visitors. 'Cookies' can also help us to learn more about your usage patterns on our site.
