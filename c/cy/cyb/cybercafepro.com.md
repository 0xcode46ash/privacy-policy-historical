 Simply put, we protect users privacy via restricting access to our data, using encryption and paying attention.
    We hope to help serve your needs well -- as we now do for Internet café owners in over 200 countries.
                                            Thank you for your trust.
                                   CyberCafePro Privacy Statement
CyberCafePro, Inc. (CCP) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. CCP provides this Privacy
Statement to inform you of our privacy policy and practices, and of the choices you can make about the way
your information is collected and used. We've structured our CCP web sites (www.cybercafepro.com and
www.cybercafepro.net/start.php) so that, in general, you can visit CCP websites without identifying yourself
or revealing any personal information should you choose. To make this notice easy to find, we make it
available at the bottom of every web page.
Notice
CCP uses personal information that you choose to supply to better understand your needs and provide you
with better service. We only use such information to support your customer relationship with CCP. We take
seriously the trust you place in us.
This privacy statement covers personally identifiable information, anonymous data collection and aggregate
reporting. Personally identifiable information is any information that is associated with your name or
personal identity. Anonymous (non-personal) information is data about usage and service operation, reported
in aggregate, which is not associated to a specific personal identity. Aggregate information is data collected
and summarized for a broad category of customers.
What we collect
Anonymous (non-personal) data we collect may include the pages visited on our sites, browser type, CCP
software versions and IP address. Our default (http://www.cybercafepro.net/start.php) and customized Client
Home Pages use cookies by third party vendors (including Google’s DoubleClick cookie) to serve ads based
on users’ prior visits to our website and/or other sites on the Internet. [To learn more about opting out of
Google’s use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising, visit aboutads.info.] CCP also uses
other technologies for data analysis aimed at improving our user services.
On the website of our exclusive-partner for CCP Support (www.internetcafesoftware.com), you need to
register for making information requests or Forum posts, or receive new service announcements and CCP
support suggestions. The types of personal information you provide on these pages may include name,
address, phone, email address, user IDs, passwords and contact preferences.
Free customized Client Home Pages (bearing your own logo, messaging to your customers, graphics, etc.)
require registration to access the Members Only Area of the Forum
(http://www.internetcafesoftware.com/forum/register.php) to then obtain a free unique Location ID for use
with your CCP Server (Main Control Station) and then have your Custom Home Page be displayed on all
your Client computers. The types of personal information you provide on these pages may include name,
address, café name, phone, email address, user IDs, passwords and contact preferences.
How we use it
CCP uses your information to help us understand your needs and interests and provide you with better
services. Specifically, we use your information to help us communicate with you, to update you on CCP
services and events, to personalize promotional offers, and to allow you to customize or personalize your
Client Home Pages. Occasionally we may also use your information to contact you for market research
regarding CCP products or services.
Anonymous (non-personal) data is aggregated for reporting about our sites' usability, performance, and
effectiveness. It is used to improve the customer experience, usability and site content.


Who we share it with
OR will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others. CCP will not share your
personal information with a business partner or any unrelated third party company unless you have given
your permission (or unless mandated by a government authority).
Choice
You can subscribe to receive information and CCP marketing communications when your register on our
Support or Custom Home Page sites. CCP communications may include new event information, special
offers or possibly an invitation to participate in market research. We give you a choice regarding CCP
communications by postal mail and email.
Links provided on our sites to third party web sites are provided as a convenience and CCP does not control
those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from ours, nor does CCP endorse or make any
representations about them. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before
submitting your personal information to them. The personal data you choose to give to unrelated third parties
is covered by their privacy policies, not the CCP Privacy Policy. Some third-party companies may choose to
share their personal data with CCP, and that sharing is governed by that third-party company's privacy
policy.
Onward Transfer
Personal data given to CCP may be transferred across state and country borders for the purposes of data
consolidation, storage and simplified customer information management. The practices, which govern this
data movement, are described in the Choice and Security sections of this privacy statement.
Access and Accuracy
CCP strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate. We have put in place managerial data
standards review processes and technological tools to maintain customer data accuracy. We will generally
provide you with access to view and change your personal information. To protect your privacy and security,
we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as a password and user ID, before granting
access to your data. Certain areas of CCP's support sites require access by specific individuals through the
use of passwords and other personal identifiers.
The most effective way to view and change your personal information is to return to the web page where you
originally submitted your data and follow the instructions on that web page; or send us a message as
described in "Contacting us" below.
Security
CCP is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure,
maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of the information, CCP has in place managerial
procedures to safeguard the information we collect.
Cookies
CCP may use third-party media companies to place ads for CCP products or services on other companies'
web sites. If you view a web page where CCP ads appear, the online media company may place a cookie or
web beacon on the user's computer. This allows the online media company to recognize the computer when it
is used to return to that site or measure advertising response. This data is anonymous and is not linked to
personal data on the user's computer or any CCP databases.
Contacting us:
We value your comments and opinions. If you have comments or questions about our privacy policy please
email us at: info@cybercafepro.com.
To opt-out of CCP marketing communications, please email us with your name, email address and
information about registrations you may have with CCP. Opt-outs can cancel marketing, support
communications and/or newsletters.
