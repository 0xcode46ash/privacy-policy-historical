**What personal information is collected?**

CyberSource collects information throughout our web site, including anonymous site statistics, domain names, and/or IP addresses.

On certain pages, CyberSource gives users the option of providing names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, and other personal information. This information is gathered only with your knowledge and active permission and participation.

**When is personal information collected?**

Forms to request additional information  
When you complete and submit a form requesting additional information, you will be asked for personal information in order to process your request. This information will be retained by CyberSource.

E-mail  
When you send us an email, we will retain the content of the email, your email address, and our response in order to handle any follow-up questions you may have.

**How does CyberSource use the personal information?**

CyberSource has the highest regard for the privacy of its customers and other visitors to our web site. As a result, we safeguard the privacy of users of our online services with the same degree of care we protect our own information.

In some instances, CyberSource may review personal information (e.g., IP address logs for file transfers), while in other cases we may use the information to generate anonymous statistics. Log file analysis help us to monitor general trends in our site traffic so that we can determine how our web site can be more effective.

CyberSource will use personal information, as appropriate in the normal course of our business, to provide you with the information, products, or services requested.

We will also use personal information to identify you, communicate with you, help us respond to your questions, and understand which CyberSource products and services best meet your needs.

Every CyberSource employee must abide by the CyberSource privacy policy. Only authorized CyberSource employees are permitted to have access to your personal information and such access is limited by need.

**Does CyberSource sell personal information?**

Under no circumstances will CyberSource sell personal information to any third party for any purpose. We may, however, share personal information with our business partners for the sole purpose of delivering products and services that you have requested and in order to communicate with you about CyberSource, its products and services. We may also release, to the minimum extent possible, specific personal information to comply with valid legal processes such as search warrants, subpoenas, or court orders.

**Can I be taken off of any solicitation lists?**

Occasionally, CyberSource sends our customers information about products and services that we believe will be of interest. If you do not wish to receive this information, please email [webmaster@cybersource.com](mailto:webmaster@cybersource.com).

**Can I check my personal information for accuracy?**

If you believe your personal information retained at CyberSource is incorrect, please send an email to [ics_support@cybersource.com](mailto:ics_support@cybersource.com). We will investigate the problem and, if appropriate, update our records.
