**PRIVACY**  
  
Cypress Semiconductor Online Privacy Policy 

Your right to privacy is very important. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. We believe this information should only be used to help us provide you with better service. That's why we have put a policy in place to protect your personal information. Below is a summary of Cypress's online privacy policy. 

  
In general, when you visit our web sites and access information you remain anonymous. We do require some personal information to enable you to access specialized areas of our site. However, we will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission. Typically, all that's requested is your name, e-mail address and some basic information about you, such as job function and contact information. There are occasions where we will ask for additional information. We do this to be able to better understand your needs and provide you with services that we believe may be valuable to you. We also give you the opportunity to elect not to receive materials from us. If you sign up for a Cypress electronic newsletter or e-mail list, each message will include instructions on how to "unsubscribe" from that list. 

  
Cypress uses cookies for several reasons and can only read cookies from our site. Cookies enable us to provide you with a better experience by allowing us to understand what areas of the web site are of interest to our visitors. If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you can still access most of our web site. 

  
We will take appropriate steps to protect your privacy. We will also take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information in storage. For example, if you supply us with your credit card information to make an online purchase, we encrypt the card number. Additionally, access to personally identifiable information is limited to individuals needing such access to perform their job function. 

We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission. However, we may need to provide your name and delivery address to third parties that Cypress uses for the purposes of delivering specific services to you (e.g., a shipping company if you have asked us to send something to you). Likewise, we will share your credit card information with the appropriate authorization and processing companies, in the event you were to purchase something via credit card. These companies will not use this information for any other purpose and will not disclose the information to anyone else. 

In addition, we respond to subpoenas, warrants, or other court orders regarding information that is contained within our access logs concerning any member or visitor. 

  
Cypress does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If we discover that a child has provided us with any personally identifiable information, we will delete that information from our systems. 

  
You can help Cypress maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying us of any changes to your address, title, phone number or e-mail address. If you need assistance in updating your information, please contact customer support at litful@cypress.com. You may update your personal registration information [here](https://web.archive.org/support/login.cfm). This information you provide to our customer support will also be covered by this policy. 

  
We provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those web sites we are not responsible for the information you might find on them or submit to them. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these third party sites. Please keep in mind that information posted to a Cypress newsgroup / forum / message board is public. 

  
Cypress welcomes comments and questions on this policy. We are dedicated to protecting your personal information, and will make every reasonable effort to keep that information secure. Due to the rapidly evolving technologies on the Internet, we may occasionally update this policy. All revisions will be posted to this site. 

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [webmaster@cypress.com](mailto:webmaster@cypress.com).
