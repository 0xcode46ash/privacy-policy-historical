The information we collect through our websites helps us provide you with information specific to your needs and interests. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) covers all of the CAQH websites, including: 

  * The CAQH organization website
  * The CAQH Universal Credentialing Datasource® websites: 
    * Data Access System
    * The CAQH Online Application System

Additional privacy policy terms and conditions may also apply to each individual site. Section VII (Additional Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions) of this Privacy Policy contains links to the additional terms and conditions for each of the CAQH sites. Please read below to review our Privacy Policy and the types of information we gather through our websites. In this privacy policy, “we”, “us”, “our” and other similar references mean CAQH and “you” and “your” and other similar references mean a specific user of the CAQH websites. By visiting the CAQH sites, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## II. HOW DOES CAQH GATHER AND USE INFORMATION?

**A. COOKIES**  
Cookies are pieces of data assigned by a web server that uniquely identify the browser on your PC. CAQH attempts to install cookies when a user arrives at any of our websites. Cookies enable our systems to gather information about your navigational patterns through the site. Viewers have the option to accept or disable cookies at any time through their browsers. Visit the “help” portion of your toolbar for more information. If you block or refuse to accept cookies, or delete cookies between visits to any of our websites, you may not be able to access or use certain features or functions of our website. 

The CAQH organization website uses session cookies for CAQH members only. The three credentialing websites use persistent cookies to allow the user to be ‘remembered’ on the website. 

**B. SERVER STATISTICS**  
We collect general statistics to track user trends on our websites. These statistics include hits to our server, the types of browsers used to access our websites, page views, and navigational patterns. The information that is collected in this manner does NOT provide us with any personally identifiable information about our users. It helps us track “where” our users are coming from. This allows us to pinpoint high traffic areas and determine the most effective ways to communicate with our users. In order to prevent the introduction of viruses and hackers into the CAQH site we may collect information, such as IP addresses, into a log file to be used to identify potential hackers of the CAQH sites. 

**C. PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US**  
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” is any information that identifies you, would enable someone to contact you, or that describes your relationship with CAQH. We collect and store Personal Information when you register to use our websites, utilize the Data Access System, the Online Application System, or the Practice Administrator Module, ask a question, complete a form, conduct a transaction, or send us an email. While you are not required to submit any information to our websites, if you do not provide the requested information, you may not be able to access or use some of the features and functions of our websites and we may not be able to provide you with certain services. Specific instances of how we collect, store, and use your Personal Information are provided for each of our websites in the additional terms and conditions section below. 

**III. WHAT SECURITY PROCEDURES DOES CAQH USE TO PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?**  
We use physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to assist us in preventing unauthorized access, maintaining data accuracy, and correctly using your Personal Information. Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, we limit access to your Personal Information to the employees, agents, and officers of CAQH who need the information for their jobs. 

**IV. WILL CAQH DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION THEY COLLECT TO OUTSIDE PARTIES?**  
CAQH will not sell, trade or rent your Personal Information to others. We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third party vendors, but these statistics do not include Personal Information. We may disclose Personal Information we collect from you if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary (a) to obey the law or comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates; (b) to protect and defend our rights or property or the rights or property of other users of our website; or (c) to act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of users of our websites or the public. 

**V. EXTERNAL LINKS**  
Other companies or organizations may have links to their websites on our websites. We are not responsible for how these other companies or organizations collect, use, disclose, or secure the information that you provide them. If you choose to access a third party website linked to one of our websites, you do so at your own risk and subject to any terms of service or privacy policy (if any) associated with such third party websites. 

**VI. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN**  
CAQH does not direct any of our content specifically to children. From our websites we do not knowingly collect or use Personal Information from children under thirteen (13) without obtaining verifiable consent from their parents or a guardian. If we learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will promptly delete any Personal Information we have collected about that user. If you are under the age of 13, please do not send us any information about yourself. 

**VII. ADDITIONAL PRIVACY POLICY TERMS AND CONDITIONS**
