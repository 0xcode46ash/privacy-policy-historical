In addition to the steps we take to safeguard the privacy and integrity of personal information submitted by adults, we adhere to the following principles and practices regarding personal information of children under 13 years old.

\- In general, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 via the Web site, and we use age screening mechanisms to help prevent children from posting data on the Web site, such as in our fan chat rooms (when available). We do not require children to register or to otherwise disclose personal information to participate in the activities in any youth-focused section of our Web site. Where children are asked to register, the kind of information they are required to provide will not intrude on their privacy rights.

\- We may offer children the opportunity to enter promotions or contests via the canucks.com Web site. In this case, the child will be asked only to provide his or her first name and email address, as well as his or her parent's email address. We will use the information only to notify the contest winners, and will require that the winner's parent provide us with whatever information is needed to provide the prize.

\- We may also post information on the Web site about other promotions or contests that are open to children but that require other personal information (such as home address or favourite hockey team) to enter. For these contests, children will be required to print a paper entry form from the Web site and have their parents sign and mail or fax the form to us. Children are not permitted to provide personal information via the Web site or to enter these contests online.

\- If you have any comments or questions about the information you or your children have submitted on this web site clickhere to access an on-line process to access, review, verify, correct, amend, or remove such information.
