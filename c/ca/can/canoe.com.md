# CANOE PRIVACY STATEMENT

CANOE is committed to upholding fundamental principles of honesty and integrity in our relationship with visitors to our web site. Our objective is to build an enduring relationship between CANOE and our users based on a foundation of integrity and trust. 

To that end, CANOE has adopted rigorous standards of privacy and makes the following promise to every visitor to our web site: 

1\. When a visitor to CANOE is required to submit registration information as a prerequisite for accessing any content area of CANOE or to use any of its interactive services, contests or newsgroups, e-commerce applications, CANOE will not share or sell that personal information about our users to any outside agency, advertiser or other third party unless the user was made aware of this possibility prior to submitting their personal information. 

2\. Although CANOE will use "[cookies](https://web.archive.org/Help/cookies.html)" to track user patterns on its web site, CANOE will not use cookies to learn the identity of its users, nor attempt to track users after they leave the CANOE site. Further, cookies will not be used by CANOE to gather specific personal information about individual users. The usage patterns tracked by individual cookies will remain confidential, and CANOE will not participate in any external site tracking programs. Nor will we share any cookie-generated information about individual users or user patterns with outside agencies or advertisers. A CANOE advertiser may be given summaries of collective user patterns. For example, an advertiser might be told their ad was viewed by 6,000 users on a particular day and 100 clicked on the ad. But an advertiser will never be given information about individual users or their browsing habits. 

3\. CANOE will not send unsolicited email to its users. Nor will the use of cookies by CANOE result in a CANOE user receiving unsolicited email from CANOE or its advertisers. CANOE will not supply email addresses to any third party without having obtained the consent of a user. 

4\. When CANOE asks its users to supply optional, personal information for contests, survey, e-commerce applications, or for any other purpose, that information will remain private and not be shared with any outside agency, advertiser or third party unless the user was made aware of this possibility prior to submitting their personal information. 

5\. CANOE will compile site-wide demographic information that it will share with advertisers, but it will not compile profiles of individual users, including the gathering of names, addresses, email addresses and other personal information, to be shared with an advertiser unless the user has consented to the compilation of this material and submitted it freely in a registration form or survey. 

6\. CANOE tracks user IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, demographic profiling and traffic logging, but CANOE will not use IP addresses to try to identify individual users of CANOE. 

7\. CANOE will abide by all court orders, valid search warrants and subpoenae.
