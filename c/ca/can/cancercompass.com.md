# Privacy Policy

Cancercompass® respects the privacy of its users.

Our goal is to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. In order to achieve this goal, we sometimes collect information during your visits to understand what differentiates you from each of our millions of other users. 

In order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have prepared this statement disclosing the privacy practices for the entire Cancercompass.com website. Additional terms and conditions, if any, regarding the collection and use of your information may also be provided to you before you sign up for a particular service. 

Here, you will learn what personally identifiable information of yours is collected, how and when we might use your information, how we protect your information, who has access to your information, and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 

## What Information is Collected

Cancercompass® collects certain information from and about its users in two ways -- directly from the user and from our Web server logs. 

### User-Supplied Information:

When you submit a form we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, and some other personal information. The more accurate information you volunteer, the better we are able to customize your Cancercompass® experience.

### Log Information:

When you visit an Internet Web site, you disclose certain information about yourself, such as your Internet [Protocol] (IP) address, the time of your visit, and the referring location (e.g., the Site or page that offered a link to a Cancercompass® page). Cancercompass®, like many other sites, records this basic information about visits to its site. You should remember that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, your information can be collected and used by others. Although Cancercompass® tries to protect your personal information, Cancercompass® cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. You are also solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords you set up and/or any account information. Neither Cancercompass.com, Rising Tide, Kft. nor Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Inc. is providing you with "covered health services" as such term is defined in HIPAA. Any information that you provide to Cancercompass.com will NOT be deemed in any way to be "protected health information", and as such, neither Cancercompass.com, Rising Tide, Kft. nor Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Inc. shall be obligated to deal with your information as required by HIPAA. You acknowledge and agree that you will never assert against any of Cancercompass.com, Rising Tide, Kft. or Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Inc. any claims arising under HIPAA.

## How and When Information is Used

We use information in different ways, depending on the type of information: 

### User-supplied information: 

This information is used for purposes such as personalization and visitor verification. 

### Web Server Logs: 

This information helps us identify which areas of our site are of interest to our visitors. Cancercompass® also collects the Internet [Protocol] (IP) addresses of its visitors for the purposes of system administration. 

## How We Protect Your Information

The privacy and protection of your personal information is vitally important to us. At this time, Cancercompass® does not make personal information available to any third parties without your permission. This may or may not change in the future without notification. Any user statistics that we may provide to prospective partners regarding your Cancercompass® usage are provided in aggregate form and do not include any personally identifiable information about any individual user. 

Your access to some services and content is password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Cancercompass® will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. You should not disclose your user name and password to others. 

In addition, if applicable, you should remember to sign out of your Cancercompass® account or service at the end of each session. You may also wish to close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, despite our efforts to protect your personal information by using the latest security technology, Cancercompass® cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or services. You transmit all such information at your own risk. However, once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 

## Who Has Access to the Information

Cancercompass® may disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or to protect the rights or property of Cancercompass®. 

We welcome any questions or comments you have about the Cancercompass® site.
