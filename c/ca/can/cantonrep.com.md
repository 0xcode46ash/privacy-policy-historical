**Data Security:** We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online.

**What information do web servers collect?**  
Web servers serving CantonRep.com automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such as which pages each user visits and the domain name (e.g., neo.rr.com) of visitors. This information is used for various purposes including internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors, and for traffic audits. We also provide this information (as well as information from third-party market researchers) about our users on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers.

**What are cookies and how does CantonRep.com use them?**  
CantonRep.com places a "cookie" on the browser of a user's computer to store and sometimes track information about you while you are on our Web site. A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted our Web site; we may also use the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as measuring certain traffic patterns. For example, cookies are used to ensure that you don't see the same ad too many times in a single session and that you do not have to reenter registration information during your visit. We may also use cookies to track your progress on our site. Advertising service vendors that serve ads into our site may also use their own cookies. You may opt-out of the cookies delivered by CantonRep.com by changing the setting on your browser. Please be aware that this will disable all cookies delivered to your browser, not just the ones delivered by CantonRep.com

**Children under 13:** Do not send any information about yourself to us - including information like your name, address or e-mail address. In general, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If, in limited circumstances, we do knowingly collect personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will do so only with verified parental consent prior to collection. In the event that we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible. 

_**Registration Questions and Answers**_  
**Why are you asking me to provide this information?**  
The registration process allows us to track the audience profile of our Web site. This enables us to provide greater demographic targeting for our advertisers and learn a little more about our users. So you may see advertisements that are more relevant to your interest. This information also helps to plan site improvements.

**How is this information stored?**  
The answers you provide are kept in a small file on your computer called a "cookie." Virtually all Web sites use cookies. CantonRep.com can use the information in the cookie to send you relevant information and advertising.

**Comments?**  
Please send us any comments you have by email to [webmaster@cantonrep.com](mailto:%20webmaster@cantonrep.com%20).
