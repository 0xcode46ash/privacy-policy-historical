**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? HOW DO WE USE IT?**  
1\. When you register to become a Candymag.com member, we ask for your name, gender, birthday, marital status, educational attainment, location, occupation, and name of school/employer. We also ask you to answer some simple questions about your lifestyle and personal preferences, such as Internet usage and hobbies. We use this information to create a profile of our members that will guide us in developing our features and services. This profile will be presented as general demographics in our media kit and other advertising materials. We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We only provide personal information to sponsors if you specify your interest in receiving information from the sponsors. 

2\. When you subscribe to any of our newsletters (Sweet Reminders, FeMAIL, etc.), all we need is your email address—which we use to send the newsletter you requested.

**TEENS**  
We take special precautions in protecting the privacy our young readers. While we expect parents to give their children a talk on staying safe on the Internet and constant guidance, we also take active steps to educate and protect the teens who visit and use our website. We provide informative feature articles on the subject of online safety and set up strict rules for the online community. We never censor discussion on TEENtalk or in the chatrooms; however, we do monitor them closely for offensive, abusive, and threatening messages. We also provide "hotlines" (by telephone, fax, Web, and email) that are dedicated to assisting and guiding our young members. 

Before you go further into the Internet, we invite you [to read "CyberSafety,"](https://web.archive.org/web/20010616173216id_/http%3A//candymag.com/about/safety.html) a primer on protecting yourself on the Internet.)
