If you need to return an item you must notify us within 7 days after receiving the unit. No returns will be accepted after that time period.

**Damages**

We do our best packaging our products to minimize damages. There are times that a unit may come damaged. It is very important to inspect the item upon delivery. If you notice any dents or punctures on the package please refuse the package or make note of it on the bill of lading and call customer service at 1-877-374-3439 for assistance or email us at [cs@canadianappliancesource.ca](mailto:cs@canadianappliancesource.ca) We will take every possible step in getting you out a new unit in a timely fashion. If the unit was accepted and signed for and there was a concealed damage, we will do everything necessary to repair the unit (if it is at all possible), or send a replacement unit and pick up the damaged unit. On occasion the unit might need minor repairs. We will send a service technician down to try and repair the unit. It may take up to 10 days for a service appointment. If the unit cannot be repaired we will send a new unit to the customer in a timely fashion.

**_Fixing errors or misprints:_** We strive to prevent errors. How we fix them depends on the error. If we find that a product description is incorrect, for example, we'll correct it.

In general, you should know that prices and availability are subject to change without notice. Errors will be corrected where discovered. Canadian Appliance Source reserves the right to revoke any stated offer and to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, including after an order has been submitted, whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged.

Individual bank policies will dictate when this amount is credited to your account.
