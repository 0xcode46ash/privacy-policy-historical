Cancerbackup does not keep a database of people who send us emails, nor do we pass on personal details to other people or organisations.

It is not necessary to include your details when giving us feedback unless you wish to receive a reply. 

Replies to questions sent to our cancer nurse specialists will be sent to the sender of the email and not to a third person or address. This is to ensure confidentiality and that information is not sent inappropriately. Any personal information you send us about you/your health is covered by the Data Protection Act 1998 and will be kept in accordance with this Act.

The information that you supply and we provide to you is kept securely for a year. It is then removed under similarly secure procedures.
