**Our Policy**  
At our site, we don't collect personally-identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. This means we don't require you to register or provide information to us in order to view our site. If you register in order to use the "Recipe Box," or "Send a Recipe to a Friend" features of our site, we use the information you supply for the purpose of providing the services you've requested. If you specifically agreed to follow-up contacts by us or asked to be put on our mailing list when you registered, we may also contact you from time to time. You can always change your preference for follow-up contacts just by e-mailing us at any time. We don't share any information you give us with anyone outside of Campbell Soup Company.

In the e-mail section of our site, we ask for some personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, and phone number. We use this information only if we need to contact you directly because our attempts to contact you by e-mail were unsuccessful. We don't use the information internally for other purposes, and we don't share it with anyone outside of Campbell Soup Company. We don't use your e-mail address for any purpose other than responding to the message you've sent.

Our site sometimes includes notices of sweepstakes or other promotions we are conducting, and we may permit you to enter electronically in some cases. If that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose of conducting the promotion (e.g., to contact you if you're a winner). We don't share the information you give us with anyone outside of Campbell Soup Company.

**Cookies**  
Like most companies, we use "cookie" technology on our web site. When you log in, the cookie tells us whether you've visited us before or are a new visitor. The cookie doesn't track any personal information about you or provide us with any way to contact you, and the cookie doesn't extract any information from your computer.
