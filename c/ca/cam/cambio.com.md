## Protecting Children

Cambio is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. 

The Cambio forums and profiles are not intended for use by children who are under the age of 13. We will not knowingly collect any information from site visitors in this age group and have taken such measures by requiring all users to enter their birth date prior to entering personally identifiable information. 

However, if we learn that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable information online, in contravention of these measures, we will take all reasonable measures to delete such information from our databases and to not use such information for any purpose except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others or as required by law. For purposes of this policy, information regarding your children that you (the parent) provide to us is treated in the same manner as information collected about users over the age of 13. 

We encourage children to talk with their parents about the information any website is collecting and decide together what information to share. We also encourage parents to talk to their children about limiting the release of personal information to anyone that they do not know.
