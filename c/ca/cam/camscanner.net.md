**Privacy Policy**

**The Information CamScanner Collects and How It is Used and Shared**

We want you to understand what kinds of information may be collected about your use of CamScanner Website ([www.camscanner.net](http://www.camscanner.net/)) and Web Services, and what we might do with that information.

**Information that Identifies Someone**

Information that identifies a particular person could be a name, email address or telephone number, for example. We will not share this information with an advertiser, and we will not share it with another Website or company, unless you tell us to (for example, if you want to post information from your Weibo page on your Facebook page or to tell your Twitter network about a television show you are watching).

We also use this kind of identifying information to provide services to you. For example, we may use it to bill you for services, to confirm your identity when you login, or to communicate with you. Sometimes we use other companies to help us provide our services.

**Information that Does Not Identify a Specific Person**

Information that does not identify a person could be a non-personal record of online activity, or information you put in a profile - like your zip code, your age or your gender (when it's used without your name). We routinely collect this kind of information and use it to improve your experience.

**Your Choices**

We want you to know how you can control the personal information that we may collect. When you use the Websites and Services that post the Privacy Policy, you are agreeing that the policy applies to you.

**Registering**

You may choose not to register for any one of the CamScanner Services (or for all of them) if you do not want to share information that identifies you when you use that Website.

If you do register, we will give you a chance to create a profile. We may use some of the information in that profile to choose the content and advertising we think you would like to see.

When you register, we may also send you email about other products and services. You may choose not to receive these messages. However, we will still send you email with information about the specific services you use.

**Blogs and Forums**

If you choose to post information on blogs or forums on the Websites, it will not be private. Once the information is posted, other users may copy or store it.

**Changes to CamScanner's Business or the Privacy Policy**

If CamScanner's business changes - for example, if our company merges with another company or we sell one or more of the CamScanner companies that provide the CamScanner Services - we may give the new owners of the CamScanner Services your information. If this happens, we will tell you. We will also let you know if the Privacy Policy changes for any other reason, so you can decide whether you want to continue using the CamScanner Services.
