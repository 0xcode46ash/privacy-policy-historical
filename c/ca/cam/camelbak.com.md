  * maintain and display your camelbak.com community profile;

  * provide you with information about our products, and special offers that may benefit you.

We do so, however, only for our own internal business purposes and will not share such combined data with third parties in a manner that would enable the recipient to personally identify you.

(d)   Service Providers.  From time to time, we may enter into relationships with third parties who provide services to us (e.g., data management, billing, or storage services).  In those circumstances, we disclose User Information that is necessary for such service providers to perform those services and require that they maintain the confidentiality of such User Information.

(e)   Other Disclosure Scenarios.  We reserve the right to share any User Information: (1) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; (2) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or property; (3) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding significant abuse of the site’s infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of information); (4) to our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (in which case we will require such entities to honor this Policy); and (5) if we are acquired by or merged with another entity.
