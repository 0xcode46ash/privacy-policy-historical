In addition, cookies are used by default on certain pages and fields of our site. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. We use cookies so that you do not need to log in manually every time you visit the site if you are a registered user. The cookie itself contains no personally identifiable information but it does pass an ID to our server which allows us to tie the cookie to your personal information.

You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you will not be able to use certain features on our site.

From time-to-time our site may request information from users via surveys, contests or for a particular service (e.g. testimonial). Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

We take online payments for the rental or purchase of textbooks. We use Authorize.net as our external payment provider.

We store these billing details on our servers in case we need to contact you in the future regarding payments. Authorize.net requires that you provide your credit card details to process the transaction. This is done on a secure Authorize.net server using SSL (secure sockets layer). _**4\. Our Disclosure of Your Information**_   


Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. 

By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.
