In addition, cookies are used by default on certain pages and fields of our site. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. We use cookies so that you do not need to log in manually every time you visit the site if you are a registered user. The cookie itself contains no personally identifiable information but it does pass an ID to our server which allows us to tie the cookie to your personal information. We also use the cookie to track how often you visit the site so we know who our most loyal users are. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you will not be able to use certain features on our site. For example, if you disable cookies, you will need to log in manually each time you visit the site as we cannot use a cookie to remember who you are. CampusBookRentals.com uses Google Analytics to track site usage; however, no personally identifiable information is shared with Google Analytics or its partners. 

**Surveys, Contests, Testimonials**   
From time-to-time our site may request information from users via surveys, contests or for a particular service (e.g. testimonial). Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested will include contact information (as supplied to the site during registration) and supplementary information on your opinions, feedback, testimonials, etc. In the event of a contest, we will use the contact information to notify winners. We will not publish winners' details on the site. If the survey or contest has a sponsor then we will share information given by entrants with the sponsor. 

**Payment Processing**   
In order to process payments online we require the billing address for the credit card used and our external payment provider, Authorize.net, requires your credit card number and details. This is all done on a secure Authorize.net server using SSL (secure sockets layer) technology. For additional information on Authorize.net, logon to www.Authorize.net and read their terms and conditions and policies. 

**Customer Names and Shipping Addresses**

CampusBookRentals.com uses third party providers to package and deliver books to its customers. Customer names and shipping addresses are shared with our suppliers and shipping providers in order to complete the delivery process. 

**3\. Our Use of Your Information**   
We use personally identifiable information about you to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's content, layout, and services. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our users' needs. 

We use your e-mail address to communicate order information to you and to provide you with other communications or information that you have requested from CampusBookRentals.com. 

We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to resolve any disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Service Policy and Rental Agreement. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular on rare occasions we may evaluate your information to look for users using multiple User IDs or alias. 

**4\. Our Disclosure of Your Information**   
Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. 

By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or 

_comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process_

served on our website. 

As a general proposition, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. 

**Legal Requests**   
CampusBookRentals.com™ cooperates with law enforcement inquiries and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights. Local, and international law enforcement agents can request and may receive your personally identifiable information. 

**5\. "Refer a Friend" Services**   
CampusBookRentals.com™ offers a service whereby you can e-mail site content to a friend or colleague. This will involve entering the e-mail address of your friend. We do not use the e-mail addresses you enter for any purpose other than to send your e-mail. We do not store, rent or sell these e-mail addresses. 

**6\. Control of Your Password**   
Except as specifically permitted by this section, you may not disclose your CampusBookRentals.com™ password to any third parties nor share it with any third parties. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password by visiting the login page on the Site. 

If you wish to change your password you can do so at any time through the 'Edit Profile' section of the site. 

**7\. Reviewing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information**   
You can at any time review and change the information you submitted during registration by visiting the login page on the site. 

You must promptly update your information if it changes. Once posted, you cannot change or remove any public postings made in our forums or other message areas or the feedback area. 

**8\. Other Information Collectors**   
Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are other members of the Site or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. 

**9\. Security**   
In order to process and protect your credit card details, our payment provider, Authorize.net uses SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption. The secure server is hosted by Authorize.net and not CampusBookRentals.com™. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**10\. Changes to Privacy Policy**   
If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email, prior to making such changes. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice, before changes go into affect, on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
