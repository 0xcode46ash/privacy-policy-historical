---  
Your privacy is important to us. [](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.campusbug.com&sealid=101)  
Introduction.   
We take your right to privacy seriously and want you to feel comfortable using our web site. This Privacy Policy deals with personally identifiable information (referred to as "Data" below) that may be collected by us on our site. This Policy does not apply to other entities that we do not own or control or persons that are not our employees, agents or within our control. Please take time to read our [Terms of Use](http://www.campusbug.com/). This privacy policy was last revised on December 26, 2005. Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time. This privacy policy is only valid for Campusbug.   
1\. Collection of Data.   
Our registration process requires only a valid e-mail address and a unique user ID and password. Providing us with other information is your option. Please take note that your user name, e-mail address, or other submissions that you make on this site may contain your real name or other personally identifiable information and, as a result, may appear on this site. If you use a bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. We reserve the right to terminate the accounts of visitors who use these services in a manner inconsistent with our Terms of Service. Like many Websites, we may also automatically receive general information that is contained in our server log files such as your IP address and cookie information. Information about how advertising may be served on this site (if at all) is set forth below.   
2\. Use of Data.   
We may use Data to customize and improve your user experience on this site. We will make efforts so that your Data will not be provided to third parties unless (i) provided for otherwise in this Privacy Policy; (ii) we obtain your consent, such as when you choose to opt-into or opt-out of the sharing of Data. We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at [customerservice@campusbug.com](mailto:customerservice@campusbug.com). You may also contact us at 1800-MED-2500 or write to 1643 W. Chapman Ave. Orange, Ca 92868 to opt-out. You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party ; (iii) a service provided on our site requires the interaction with or is provided by a third party, by way of example an Application Service Provider; (iv) pursuant to legal process or law enforcement; (v) we find that your use of this site violates our Policy, Terms of Service, other usage guidelines, or as deemed reasonably necessary by us to protect our legal rights and/or property; (vi) or this site is purchased by a third party whereby that third party will be able to use the Data in the same manner as we can as set forth in this Policy. In the event you choose to use links that appear on our site to visit other web sites, you are advised to read the privacy policies that appear on those sites. We want you to be fully informed that we do not control these other Websites; hence this specific privacy policy is not applicable to these other Websites. As a result, these other Websites may collect different kinds of information about you, and may disclose that information differently. We suggest that you review their privacy policies and remind you that we at Campusbug.com will not be responsible for their actions. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Medmania, Inc., such as acquisition by or merger with another company, we will provide notice before any personally identifiable information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.   
3\. Cookies.   
Like many Websites, we set and use cookies to keep track of your purchases. In the continual process of enhancing user interaction and experience at Campusbug.com, we may retain your personal settings, and if you choose, your password and financial information so you do not have to constantly re-enter this information with each visit to Campusbug.com. Advertisements may appear on our Website and, if so, may set and access cookies on your computer and are subject to the privacy policy of those parties providing the advertisements. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.
