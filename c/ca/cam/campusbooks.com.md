# CampusBooks - Your online comparison shopping site

**  
** At CampusBooks.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy. CampusBooks.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site and we do not sell or rent this information to other companies. CampusBooks.com collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site: 

  
In order to use value-added features of this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to provide the user with a more personalized comparison shopping experience, to administer promotional contests and sweepstakes, and to provide our advertisers with broad demographic information about our user base. 

  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests or Drawings that take place. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

  
CampusBooks.com provides advertisers with broad, aggregated demographic information about our user base. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.   
  
  
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that CampusBooks.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

  
All users are automatically subscribed to our (infrequent) newsletter. To unsubscribe, please send an email to [unsubscribe@campusbooks.com](mailto:%20unsubscribe@campusbooks.com). Your email address will remain strictly confidential and is not shared with any other company. 

  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address. CampusBooks.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. CampusBooks.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may remove the information from our database at any time by notifying us at info@campusbooks.com. CampusBooks.com does not sell or rent our customer email list to other companies. 

  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and off-line. If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can send an email to [info@campusbooks.com](mailto:info@campusbooks.com). 

  
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below. 

****  
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Users may opt-out of receiving these announcements at any time by notifying us at [info@campusbooks.com](mailto:info@campusbooks.com).

  
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our Customer Support. 

  
Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our enrollment form has an ‘opt-out’ mechanism so users who use our service, but don’t want any marketing materials, can keep their email address off of our lists. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking emailing us at [unsubscribe@campusbooks.com](mailto:unsubscribe@campusbooks.com).

  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
