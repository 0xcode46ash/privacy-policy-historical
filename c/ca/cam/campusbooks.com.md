**Our privacy policy is very simple. We do not sell or rent your personal information to anyone. See below for details.**

**Information Collection and Use**   
At CampusBooks.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy. CampusBooks.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site and we do not sell or rent this information to other companies. CampusBooks.com collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site:   


**Registration**   
In order to use value-added features of this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). We never sell or rent this personally identifiable information to third party companies. We use this information to make your online textbook buying experience as easy and efficient as possible. For example, by enrolling with us you can create and save a personalized booklist that compares prices on all of your books simultaneously. In order for us to provide you with this service, we need for you to have password protected access to your booklist information in our database. This is only possible if you enroll and create an account with a user name and password.   


**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.   


**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.   


**Sharing**  
CampusBooks.com may occasionally provide other companies with broad, aggregated demographic information about our user base. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

**Links **  
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that CampusBooks.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.   


**Newsletter**   
Registered users have the option of subscribing to our (infrequent) newsletter. You may opt out at any time simply by logging on to your account and unsubscribing. Your email address will remain strictly confidential and is not shared with any other company.   


**Surveys & Contests **  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.   


**Tell-A-Friend**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. CampusBooks.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. CampusBooks.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may remove the information from our database at any time by notifying us at info@campusbooks.com. CampusBooks.com does not sell or rent our customer email list to other companies.   


**Security**  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and off-line. If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can send an email to [info@campusbooks.com](mailto:info@campusbooks.com).   


**Special Offers**  
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.   


**Correction/Updating Personal Information**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, you can adjust your personal settings by logging on to your campusbooks.com account or by emailing our Customer Support.   


**Choice/Opt-out**   
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of receiving our newsletter by emailing us at [unsubscribe@campusbooks.com](mailto:unsubscribe@campusbooks.com).   


**Notification of Changes**   
If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes here on the privacy page so our users are always aware of what information, if any, we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
