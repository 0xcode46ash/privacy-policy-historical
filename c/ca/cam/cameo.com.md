###  Legal Disclaimer

We may also disclose information against someone who poses a threat to our interests (such as customer fraud) or whose activities could bring harm to others. In addition, it may be necessary for us to provide customer information to third parties, such as credit card companies, for the purpose of resolving disputes that arise in the normal course of business.

In addition, it may be necessary for us to provide customer information to third parties, such as credit card companies, for the purpose of resolving disputes that arise in the normal course of business. 

###  Third Party Intermediaries

We use an outside credit card processing company and bank check processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

###  Suppliers

We provide information about meeting venues either reserved or purchased on eVenues.com to the venue suppliers who fulfill your space reservation. Although we might offer meeting services from caterers, restaurants, photocopy services, office rental services and other suppliers that are reputable companies, we have not placed limitations on these suppliers from using or disclosing your information without your permission. Therefore, we encourage you to review the information privacy practices of any meeting suppliers whose products you purchase on eVenues.com. In addition, these meeting service suppliers may also contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about your confirmed reservation. 

We will occasionally share aggregated information with our service providers. This information does not contain any personally identifiable information and is used to develop featured programs and content that will be of interest to our members and website visitors.

###  Affiliated Websites

If you were referred to eVenues.com from another website, we may provide personally identifiable information about you to the referring website. Although we believe that the website companies from which you were referred to us are reputable companies, we have not place limitations on the referring websites companies from using or disclosing your information without your permission.

###  Choice/Opt-Out

Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our website at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an opt-out mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address and phone number off of our lists. 

Users of our website are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party. 

###  Links

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, eVenues.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by this website. 

###  Surveys and Contests

From time-to-time our website requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this website. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use user's personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

###  Security

We take precaution to protect our user's information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our reservation order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - Secure Socket Layer (SSL). While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just surfing. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user-information off-line. All of our user's information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility. 

If users have any questions about the security at our website, users can send an email to [Customer Care ](https://web.archive.org/web/20100629013017id_/http%3A//www.evenues.com/ContactUs.aspx)

In order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation to users, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from third party sources. 

###  Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address) changes or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate user's personally identifiable information. Members can change their personal information on the member profile page of our website. Members and users can all email our Customer Support at [ Customer Care ](https://web.archive.org/web/20100629013017id_/http%3A//www.evenues.com/ContactUs.aspx)or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. 

###  Notification of Material Changes

If we decide to make any material change to our Privacy Statement, we will post those changes to this Privacy Statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Statement under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we are going to use user's personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on this website notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
