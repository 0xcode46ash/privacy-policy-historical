# Privacy Policy | CashReview.net

Your Privacy:

Your privacy is important to me.  To better protect your privacy I’ll provide this notice explaining my online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

To make this notice easy to find, I make it available on my homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

I will not be putting up spammy-ass Adsense on this site, so you don’t have to worry about cookies from Google or other advertising companies.

Collection of Personal Information:

When visiting CashReview.net or any of my [Internet marketing coaching](http://www.cashreview.net/internet-marketing-coaching/) or product [review](http://www.cashreview.net/review/ "Review") posts, the IP address used to access the site will be logged along with the dates and times of access.  This information is purely used to analyze trends, administer the site, track users movement and gather broad demographic information for internal use.

Most importantly, any recorded IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. I do have a hover pop and a multiple opt-in forms throughout the site.  Your information is 100% safe and secure and will never be rented, shared, sold or compromised in any other way.

This is something I take very serious.  SPAM sucks and I would never contribute to the “shadeball” marketing movement.

Links to Third Party Websites:

I’ve included links on this site for your use and reference.  I’m not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites.  You should be aware that the privacy policies of these sites may differ from mine.

Changes to This Privacy Statement:

The contents of this statement may be altered at any time, at my totally powerful discretion. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of **CashReview.net** , then you may contact me by clicking on the “Contact” tab (go figure, right?) in the upper right hand corner of any page.

Be safe out there.
