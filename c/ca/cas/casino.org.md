We have created this Privacy Policy to inform you about how we manage, collect and use your information through your use of our websites, which provide information with regards to casino games and the gambling industry (collectively: the “Services”). 

The Privacy Policy is a part of our Terms of Service and is incorporated therein by references.

We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy carefully and use it to make informed decisions. By using our Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and your continued use of the Services constitutes your ongoing agreement to this Privacy Policy.

### What type of information we collect

• The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a user(s), which may be made available or gathered via your use of the Services (“Non-personal Information”). We are not aware of the identity of the user from which the Non-personal Information was collected. 

In order to enhance the functionality of the Services and to provide you with a better user experience, we collect technical information transmitted by your computer, including certain software and hardware information (e.g. the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time and the domain name of the website from which you linked to the Services; etc.). 

We also collect information about your use of the Services, such as user activity (e.g. pages viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, online browsing, clicks, actions, etc.). This information is collected for amongst other things for research and analytics purposes about your use of the Services. 

We may anonymize or de-identify the information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information cannot, on its own, personally identify you. Our use and disclosure of such aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation and for any purpose.

• The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“Personal Information”). 

We may collect specific types of connection details and information with regard to your device and hardware that may identify you, such as IP address and geo-location data. 

If we combine Personal Information with Non-personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.
