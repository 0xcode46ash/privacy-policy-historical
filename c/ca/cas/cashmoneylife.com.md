### **About Cash Money Life**

Cash Money Life is a personal finance, small business, and career journal, with daily articles about a myriad of financial, small business, and career topics, timeless tutorials, current events, product reviews, and more. This blog has served as both a learning experience and a venue to share my thoughts and views with others. I am not a professional financial planner, but I am positive you will find a lot of useful information in these pages. If this is your first visit here, I encourage you to visit the links in the sidebars where you will find articles organized by categories, top articles, reviews, and more. Or just click on the home page and start reading! Feel free to [contact me](http://cashmoneylife.com/contact/) with any questions, tips, or article ideas.

### **About the Author**

Hello, my name is Ryan Guina and I am the primary author and editor of Cash Money Life (I used to [blog under the name Patrick](http://cashmoneylife.com/should-you-blog-anonymously/ "should you use a pseudonym for blogging?")). I am a writer, small business owner, entrepreneur, and professional in the corporate world. I have been married for 3 years and we have a beautiful newborn girl. I served a tour in the US Air Force, and I also run a military money website – [**The Military Wallet**](http://themilitarywallet.com/). My wife and I live in the Mid-West and plan on being here for a few more years. In the meantime, we continue to enjoy our current life while planning our future.

I wish you all well on your personal journey to financial freedom and happiness!

~ Ryan Guina
