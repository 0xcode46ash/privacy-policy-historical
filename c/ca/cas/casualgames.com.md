#### I. INDIVIDUALS AGE 13 AND OVER

#### COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION BY PN

General. PN only collects personally identifiable information (information such as a visitor's name, e-mail address, mailing address, or telephone number) that is voluntarily submitted to us. Visitors may be asked to give this information in connection with our contests, sweepstakes, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content submissions, chat rooms, bulletin boards, requests for suggestions, visitors' requests for products or services, and visitors' requests for additional information.

Joint Collection of Personal Information. Sometimes PN collects personal information jointly with business partners or sponsors. The identity of these other parties collecting personal information is made clear at the time your personal information is collected. A description of shared use can be found in the rules for sweepstakes and promotions, and in the specific Terms of Use for this Site. The identity of the entities collecting personal information is made clear at the time your personal information is collected.

WHAT PN DOES (AND DOESN'T DO) WITH THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT General. PN uses personally identifiable information only for the purpose for which it is submitted unless we disclose other uses at the time of collection, in which case you will have the opportunity to inform us not to use you data in other ways (i.e., "opt-out").

Sharing Personal Information. PN may share personally identifiable information with other Premium Network companies or with some of our business partners who would like to send you information about their products or services. However, when you submit your information, you will have the opportunity to let us know if you do not want us to share your information in these ways.

#### LINKS/CO-BRANDED SITES

PN has established relationships with advertisers and business partners that allow visitors to our Site to link directly to sites operated by these partners. Some of these sites may be "co-branded" with a PN logo; however, they are not operated or maintained by PN and we are not responsible for the content or practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our Site. These links are meant for the user's convenience only. Once you have left this Site via such a link, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. We are not responsible for any information these sites may obtain and do not oversee their policies or practices in collecting personal information.

#### NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

When visitors come to our Site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which web pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks, if any, were "clicked" by the visitor. Collecting such information involves the logging of operating systems (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), type of browser software (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), Internet service providers (e.g., AOL or NET.COM) and IP addresses used by each visitor to the Site. Although such information is not personally identifiable, it can be used to determine the IP address of the visitor's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity to the Internet.

Cookies are small bits of information that our site places on the hard drive of your computer to enable us to do a number of things to make your visit and future visits to the site more enjoyable. For example, cookies allow a visitor to quickly log on to a site he/she has used before by storing a password. Most major sites on the Internet use cookies. The cookie does not contain any personally identifiable information about a visitor, and PN does not use cookies in order to get such information. PN will never save credit card information in cookies. Visitors may receive cookies from third parties, but PN cannot control the content of these cookies. You should consult your browser's documentation or "help" feature for instructions on how to be notified and control whether cookies are transferred to you computer.

PN uses the information obtained through the use of cookies in order to improve the Site. By obtaining this information, we are able to continually improve our Site and bring you the best online experience possible. By tracking how many people visit our Site and where visitors go on our Site, we are able to determine which part of the Site users like the best, which part needs some improvement, and what changes should be made. PN may also disclose some of the non-personal information we obtain to advertisers to inform them of how many people have seen or linked to their advertisements on our Site. However, we will never disclose personally identifiable information to these advertisers without your consent.

#### REVIEWING OR DELETING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

Visitors may review or delete personal information from our records at any time. If you would like to review or delete your personal information, please contact us by filling out the form here . call us at 1-415-575-1444, or write us at Premium Network, Inc., Attn: Personal Info, 1663 Mission Street, Suite 560, San Francisco, California 94103. If you have requested the deletion of your information, we will immediately delete your information from our database and refrain from collecting any other personally identifiable information from you, if you so request. However, there may be residual information that will remain within our databases that may or may not contain personally identifiable information. This residual information will not be given to any other third party or used for any commercial purpose.

### II. ADDITIONAL POLICIES THAT APPLY TO CHILDREN UNDER 13 

#### KIDS AND INTERNET SAFETY

We at PN understand that the Internet presents an opportunity for us to reach the public in new and exciting ways with information about our contests and sweepstakes, fun games, e-mail, chat rooms, bulletin boards, and other forms of interactivity. PN also recognizes the privacy concerns of parents, and the importance of protecting the privacy of the information this Site collects from kids. Parents of kids who visit this Site can be confident that any personal information that may be provided to this Site will be collected and maintained in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). PN encourages parents to supervise their kids' activities online and to participate in their kids' online activities whenever possible. However, we understand that parents may not always be able to supervise their kids' activities on the Internet. That's why PN has developed a Site that parents can feel is safe for their kids and kids will find educational, informative, and fun! Because there's always room for improvement, PN welcomes any suggestions on how to make the Site a better, safer place to visit.

#### COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13

PN does not require the disclosure of more personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 than is reasonably necessary for him or her to participate in an activity on our Site. We may use personally identifiable information submitted to this Site by kids under 13 in a variety of ways, which are described below. In each instance, we comply with the parental consent requirements of COPPA.

  * A. Use of a Child's Information by PN. We may collect a child's e-mail address in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or game for the purpose of communicating with the child on a one-time-only basis (i.e., to contact a contest winner). Parental consent is obtained before we send the winner a prize. We may collect a child's e-mail address in order to respond more than once to a child's specific request. For example, the child may want to subscribe to an online newsletter or receive other online communications from PN. In these instances, PN will also obtain a parent's e-mail address along with the child's. Before any further contact with the child, PN will send an e-mail to the parent (a) notifying him or her that we have collected the child's e-mail address in order to respond more than once to the child's request for a subscription, information, etc; (b) informing the parent that he or she can refuse us permission to contact the child, and how to do so; and (c) informing the parent that if he or she does not respond to the e-mail within two (2) weeks, PN may use the child's information for the purpose for which it was submitted. We may collect a child's personally identifiable information (including name, e-mail address, mailing address, and phone number) for such activities as joining the Premium Kids Club, chat rooms, forums, surveys, games, bulletin boards, requests for suggestions, subscription registrations, requests for products or services, content submissions or requests for additional information. In these instances, we will initially collect only the child's name and online contact information and the e-mail address of the child's parent. Before using this information for any purpose, we will send the parent an e-mail that (a) lets the parent know that we wish to collect and use the child's personal information and need the parent's consent to do so, and (b) provides the parent with a link to access this Privacy Policy, which describes our information collection and use policies as required by COPPA. If the proposed use of the child's personal information does not involve disclosure to a third party, then PN will ask the parent to provide consent by return e-mail. Upon receipt of the e-mail consent, we will send the parent a confirming e-mail. If the proposed use of the child's personal information involves disclosure to third parties, the e-mail we send to the parent will ask the parent either to (i) return by postal mail or fax a consent form that will be attached to the e-mail, or (ii) call a toll-free number where consent can be given over the phone. If parental consent is not obtained by one of these methods within one (1) week, PN will delete all of the child's and parent's personally identifiable information from its records. In addition, parents can revoke a prior consent at any time. We may collect a child's name and e-mail address to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security of this Site, to protect against liability, or as required or permitted by law. Information collected for these reasons will not be used for any other purpose.
  * B. Sharing Children's Personal Information with Third Parties. PN may share a child's personal information with our affiliated companies and promotional partners for their marketing purposes. PN will only share personal information about a child with third parties if PN has received parental consent. As noted above, parents may exercise their option not to consent to the disclosure of their child's personal information to third parties.



#### LINKS/CO-BRANDED SITES

As mentioned in Section I of this Privacy Policy, this Site may link to sites operated by PN's business partners, advertisers, and affiliated companies. Those sites, which are not controlled by PN, may collect personal information from your child. Parents should therefore check the relevant site's privacy policy to understand how it collects and uses kids' personal information. PN will not share in any personal information obtained by a site from a child under the age of 13 unless that site follows the requirements of COPPA.

#### REVIEWING OR DELETING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13
