### Data protection declaration

#### 1\. Dealing with personal information

CASIO Europe GmbH will only collect and process statistically-anonymous access figures from the web space provider, and this will not include any personal user information. The statistical access figures include, for example, the web sites that are accessed most frequently, as well as the previous page used to access the web site (e.g. via a search engine). 

CASIO uses pixels and transparent GIF files to support online advertising. These files enable CASIO to track which adverts are used to access the particular Internet pages. The information which is produced and used in this way cannot be used to identify any specific individual - it does not contain any details of names, e-mail addresses, residential addresses or telephone numbers. 

This statistical data is not related back to individual people, and is processed on a purely anonymous basis. It should be noted, however, that all Internet users leave traces when visiting web sites, and that these traces could be used at a later date for identification purposes, for instance by using the IP address. 

No other personal information will be stored without your permission. You alone decide whether you wish to disclose your personal information to CASIO, for instance as part of a survey or whilst entering a competition. All information that is collected in this manner is handled in complete confidence, and is not disclosed to any third party without permission. It will only be stored while it is being used to carry out specific services that are provided, and will then be fully erased. This information will not be passed to third parties for advertising purposes unless you have given specific permission for this to be done. Permission can be withdrawn, and can be given electronically at any time, as long as this is a clear and conscious act on your part. Your compliance will be recorded by us, and you can access the contents of this compliance at any time. 

All information given during product registration is evaluated on an anonymous basis, as this relates solely to improving products and their characteristics. 

Personal data relating to company employees will only be published with the explicit permission of those affected.
