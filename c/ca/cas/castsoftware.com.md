# CAST Privacy Statement

We at CAST SA (“CAST”) respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information we may collect from you on castsoftware.com and casthighlight.com, how we may use the information and with whom we may share it. In addition, we tell you how you can ask us to (i) access, change or not use the personal information we maintain about you, (ii) withdraw consent you previously provided to us, (iii) refrain from sending you certain communications, and (iv) answer questions you may have about our privacy practices.

Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the CAST website located at [castsoftware.com](http://www.castsoftware.com/) and [casthighlight.com](http://www.casthighlight.com/).

### **Information We Collect**

We may ask you to provide personally identifiable information. Generally, this information will consist of your name and contact information, such as your email address, phone number and physical address. We may request this information from you in connection with activities such as account creation, use of services, downloads of our software, inquiries about becoming a CAST partner, inquiries about jobs at CAST, job applications, conference or training registrations and requests for support. In connection with job inquiries and job applications we may require additional personal information from you, such as your education history.

In addition, when you visit our website, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. The information we collect in this manner enables us to better serve you when you return to our site- for example, it can “remember” your email address to save you having to enter it manually upon your return. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. We may use third party web analytics services on this site, such as those of Google Analytics. The service providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies to help us analyze how visitors use the site. The information collected through these means (including IP address) is disclosed to these service providers, who use the information to evaluate use of the website. To disable Google Analytics, please download the browser add-on for the deactivation of Google Analytics provided by Google at <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.

  * provide services to you;

  * provide you with notice of product releases, special events, trainings, promotions or other matters relevant to you;

  * provide technical support and respond to your inquiries;

  * improve the level of service you receive from us;

  * prevent you from having to re-enter your personal information on future visits to our website;
