# Secure Independence and the Privacy of our Visitors and Members

**Secure Independence and the Privacy of our Visitors and Members**

At Secure Independence, we respect your privacy whether you're a first-time Visitor or a dedicated Member. We do collect information from you, but our policy is to ensure that all personal information remains private to the extent that Members and Visitors wish it to remain private. To earn your trust and confidence in the Internet and in Secure Independence, we are disclosing our privacy practices and the uses of the information we gather. 

To protect your privacy, Secure Independence:

  * Will use personal identifying information about you in a manner consistent with this Privacy Notice.
  * Will not knowingly collect personal identifying information from children under 13 or knowingly use such information without express parental consent.



As you may know, Secure Independence serves as an Internet and web hosting provider, and an advertising source. Secure Independence does not always operate or control the individual Web sites which are advertised in our newsletter. Advertisers may have their own privacy and content guidelines or restrictions. Secure Independence does not control what appears on the Web sites contained in our newsletter.

**A. SECURE INDEPENDENCE'S COLLECTION AND USE OF GENERAL INFORMATION FROM MEMBERS AND VISITORS**

Secure Independence collects information from all Visitors to our site, including IP address, operating system, and browser software. Using your IP address, we can determine your Internet Service Provider and your geographic location. This information reflects the population as a whole rather than focusing on individuals, and we use it to identify portals and other areas on our Web site and evaluate the effectiveness of our promotional activities.

We also use this information to perform statistical analyses of collective characteristics and behavior, so we can measure overall Visitor demographics and interests regarding the Site. 

Secure Independence does not collect the e-mail addresses of people who communicate with us via e-mail; we use the addresses only to respond to them.

**B. SECURE INDEPENDENCE'S COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION FROM ITS MEMBERS AND VISITORS**

Personal identifying information includes:

  * Home or other physical address
  * Phone number
  * Any other information that identifies a specific individual
  * Any information which, when tied to the above listed specific information, can identify a specific individual.



We collect information at various locations throughout the site. We give notice at each location that asks for personal identifying information, and such information will be used only for the purposes stated at the location of the collection, and/or within this Privacy Statement. When we collect personal identifying information, you will always have the choice of whether or not to provide it. However, you may not be able to receive certain of Secure Independence's services without providing the information requested.

We use this information for administrative and other purposes that we believe are necessary to maintain, improve and enhance our services. Such uses include data transmission, surveys of our Members, sending e-mail messages to all of our Members. 

Secure Independence fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those persons who use our services for illegal activities, and we reserve the right to release personal identifying information about Members when we believe our services are being used unlawfully even without a subpoena, warrant or court order.

We do not control the actions of our Members or Visitors. If you disclose personal information to others, it may be collected and used by others. Secure Independence does not assume any responsibility for actions of those other parties.

**C. SECURE INDEPENDENCE DOES NOT KNOWINGLY COLLECT INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN**

We believe that it is especially important to protect children's privacy online.

Note: Secure Independence defines children as minors under the age of 13 years.

We do not knowingly collect any personal identifying information from children. 

**D. MEMBERS? ABILITY TO CHANGE/REMOVE INFORMATION**

If, at any time you would like to find out the information Secure Independence maintains about you, or change or delete any information within Secure Independence's active database just view the "Update Our Records" on the Members Benefits page.

If you leave Secure Independence, we may delete your information from our active database. Residual information will remain within our archived database and records.

All Members and Visitors should be aware that, when they disclose personal identifying information to others, the information may be collected and used by others to send that person unsolicited e-mail from other parties, outside Secure Independence. If you encounter any Secure Independence Member  who is improperly collecting or using information about users, please contact: [info@NameYourPriceWebHosting.com](mailto:info@NameYourPriceWebHosting.com).

**E. SECURITY OF INFORMATION COLLECTED BY SECURE INDEPENDENCE**

Information collected by Secure Independence is stored on secure servers and access is limited to authorized personnel only.

**F. OUTSIDE PARTY COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION**

Please be aware that Secure Independence does not control the acts of its Members or Visitors. All Members and Visitors should be aware that, when they disclose personal information, on their Web site or elsewhere on the site, the information might be collected and used by others. Additionally, Members should be aware that when they link, or click on ad banners, they might go to other sites not operated by Secure Independence. These outside parties may have different privacy policies from those of Secure Independence. If you are asked to divulge personal identifying information at any point outside Secure Independence, please be aware that privacy policies other than Secure Independence may apply to the collection and use of that information. Secure Independence does not control and does not assume any responsibility for any actions of third parties.
