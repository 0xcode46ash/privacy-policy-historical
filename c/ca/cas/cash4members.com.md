                      Therefore, this type of cookies allows us to recognize you

• Flash Cookies. Certain features of our Website may use local stored
  objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your
  preferences and navigation to, from and on our Website. Flash
  cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used
  for browser cookies. For information about managing your privacy and
  security settings for Flash cookies, see “Choices About How We Use

• Web Beacons. Pages of our the Website and our e-mails may contain
  small electronic files known as web beacons (also known as clear gifs,
  pixel tags, single-pixel gifs and web bugs) that are tiny graphics with a
  unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track
  the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike
  cookies which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web
  beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and
  are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web
  beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to
  count users who have visited certain pages or opened an e-mail, to
  understand usage patterns and for other related website statistics (for
  example, recording the popularity of certain website content and
  verifying system and server integrity). We also may receive an
  anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an
  online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.
• Analytics Tools. We use analytics tools and other third party
  technologies, such as Google Analytics and DoubleClick Cookies, to
  collect non-personal information in the form of various usage and user
  metrics when you use our Website. These tools and technologies
  collect and analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP
  addresses, device and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs,
  onsite behavior and usage information, feature use metrics and
  statistics, usage and purchase history, media access control address
  (MAC Address), mobile unique device ID, and other similar
  information. The third party analytics companies who collect
  information on our Website and other online products or services may
  combine the information collected with other information they have
  independently collected from other websites or other online or mobile
  products and services relating to your activities across their network of
  websites as well as online or mobile products and services. Many of
  these companies collect and use information under their own privacy
  policies. In addition to our use of technologies as described herein, we
  may permit certain third party companies to help us tailor advertising
  that we think may be of interest to you based on your use of our
  Website and to otherwise collect and use data about your use of our
  Website. For more information about this practice, please see the
  “Third Party Advertising Technologies” section below. You may opt out
                                5

                This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided
                by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are
                text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how
                users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about
                your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted
                to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of
                activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the
                last octet of the IP address for Germany. Only in exceptional cases,
                the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the
                USA. On behalf of the website provider Google will use this
                information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website,
                compiling reports on website activity for website operators and
                providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage
                to the website provider. Google will not associate your IP address with
                any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by
                selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please
                note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality
                of this website. Furthermore you can prevent Google’s collection and

                the           browser            plug-in         available           under
                https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB.
                You can refuse the use of Google Analytics by clicking on the
                following link. An opt-out cookie will be set on the computer, which

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide
to us.
       •       You can choose not to provide us with certain personal information,
               but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our
               Website because such information may be required in order for you to
               register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a
               contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate

               information that you have provided to us by updating your preferences
               on the Account Settings page or by contacting us at the email address
               provided at the end of this privacy policy.

               limited to, user profile data, sharing data and any other data, or

               deleted. Deletion of your data may take up to 30 days from accessible
               systems and up to 90 days from backup systems. If you choose to
               have an account with us in the future, you will have to sign up for a
               new account as none of the information you previously provided or
               saved within your account will have been saved.

HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural
measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access
and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access
personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In
addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information
between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized
persons from gaining access to your personal information.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have
given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our
Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not
to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out
information in public areas of the Website like message boards. The information you
share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.
We want you to feel confident using our Website. However, no system can be
completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we
do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches,
or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with
how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending
personal information through insecure email. We are not responsible for
circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.

information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or
cause the information to be incorrect.
