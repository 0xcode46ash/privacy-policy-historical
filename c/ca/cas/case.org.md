### Privacy Statement

**1\. Our Commitment to Privacy**

(a) At the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), we respect your right to privacy and recognize that our primary responsibility is to meet your interests and needs as a member or friend of CASE. Therefore, the CASE Board of Trustees has adopted the following privacy statement explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information may be collected and used. This statement is part of our Web legal page and user agreement.

**2\. The Information We Collect--Registration**

(a) In order to use certain features of this Web site, a user must first complete a registration form. During registration, a user is required to give contact information, such as name and e-mail address, institutional affiliation, and job title. This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they may have expressed interest. It will be optional for the user to provide additional information, such as demographic information, and personally identifiable information so that we can provide a more personalized experience.

**3\. The Information We Collect and Use--Orders**

(a) Whenever you place an order via this site or register for a conference, information will be requested on an order form. The information requested would include name and shipping address, financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customers' orders.

**4\. The Information We Collect and Use--Cookies**

(a) Our Web site does not use "cookie" technology in ways that compromise your privacy. We use a feature of your Web browser called "cookies" to automate certain aspects of our Web site. Cookies are very small files that are stored on your computer and that enable us to recognize your computer each time you return to our site. By using cookies, we can keep track of your preferences, what you have already seen on our site and what you haven't, and any personalization you've done, without requiring you to enter a password every time you come back.

(b) We do not use cookies in any way that would disclose your personally identifiable information to a third party without your consent. Please be aware that other companies may collect various types of information about you and have different privacy policies and practices. CASE takes care to ensure its users' privacy -- but not every company has comparable policies. Other than CASE's own site, no site on the Web is under CASE's control, not even those sites to which we may provide links, and CASE cannot assume any responsibility for any other site's content or practices. Providers of Internet sites or services have separate data and privacy practices independent of CASE that govern the manner in which they use the information that you provide to them. Many Web sites use cookies to recognize you when you return to their site; some sites require that you provide information before they allow you to enter; some automatically gather information when you visit, such as what operating system your computer runs, what type of Web browser you use, what Internet access provider you use, or what other Web pages you visit; and sites vary greatly (from each other and from CASE) with regard to how they use such information and to whom they disclose it. We encourage you to exercise care each time you are asked to provide personally identifiable information at a site whose privacy policies you don't know.

(c) Even at CASE's site, many of the features and much of the content is supplied by third parties (or jointly by CASE and one or more third parties), each of which has its own privacy policies and practices. You may be asked to provide personally identifiable information when you register for certain services or promotions on our site; in such cases, the information you provide may be collected and used by a third party rather than, or in addition to, CASE. Our policy requires such third parties to notify you in advance if they intend to use information you provide for purposes unrelated to the services or promotions for which you sign up, and to give you the opportunity to choose not to use their service rather than share your information with them, but we cannot assume responsibility for their compliance with our policy.

(d) We may engage third parties to serve the advertisements that appear on our Web site and within other parts of the CASE interface. These companies may use cookies to ensure you do not see the same advertisements too often, and these cookies also may collect information about you when you view or click on an advertisement. Such ad-serving companies are responsible for placing and reading these cookies; we do not have access to these cookies or control how they are used.

**5\. More on How We Use Information**

(a) In addition to use of cookies as described above, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your preferences and to gather broad demographic information.

(b) We use the information you provide about yourself when ordering a product or service, registering for a conference, or becoming a CASE member to complete the transaction. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete the transaction.

(c) We use the information we collect based on usage by those who register with the CASE Network to customize the information on the site to the user's interests.

(d) We use the information you provide about yourself for the in-print and on-line membership directory for a variety of organizational purposes, including sharing with you information about CASE products and services we think might be of interest to you. We offer postal mailing lists for rent to third parties, but we do not sell, rent, or share e-mail addresses with external organizations or individuals.

(e) We use data gathered through surveys and benchmarking studies solely for the purposes described therein. Unless specifically noted otherwise, no personally identifiable information is disclosed in reporting on these surveys and studies.

(f) We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our web site and other CASE services. We also may share such information with associations, organizations and commercial enterprises to help them understand the makeup of the CASE membership.

(g) Finally, we do not intend to use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

**6\. Public Forums**

(a) The CASE Network makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. As indicated above, please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personally identifiable information.

For example, we may include in your profile data supplied by the institution with which you are employed. 8.
