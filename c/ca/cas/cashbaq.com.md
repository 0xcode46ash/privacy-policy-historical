# Privacy Policy

**Overview**  
We at 77Blue LLC, owner and operator of the Cashbaq Web site located at [www.cashbaq.com](http://www.cashbaq.com/), take privacy very seriously, and have written this Privacy Policy to clearly communicate (a) the type of personal information collected from users; (b) why this information is collected; and (c) who will have access to this information. Furthermore we want to emphasize that we take every precaution in protecting this information, and that we do not share this information with third parties. 

Frankly, we don’t want your information but in order to provide you with the service, we have to take it. We require you to give as little information as possible. To sign up, all we need is your e-mail address and a password. We require an e-mail address so we can verify that you wanted to sign up. If you sign up for favorite merchants or save coupons or products, we will send you notification e-mails. You can opt out from receiving our e-mails at any time. The only reason you have to give us your mailing address is to get paid. (Note: We’re working on way so you don’t have to give us your mailing address as, like we said, we don’t want your personal information.) 

Things we hate as much as you do: We hate SPAM. We hate junk mail. We hate telemarketers calling us at dinner… OK, so we hate telemarketers calling us any time. We’re not going to subject you to any of that ourselves or by selling your information to someone who will. We won’t sell your information to anyone and are committed to keeping your private information private.

**What Type of Information Do We Collect?**  
77Blue may collect any or all of the following two types of information: (a) Personally Identifiable Information and (b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personally Identifiable Information is requested when you register with us, fill out surveys, participate in a contest or special offer, correspond with us, or otherwise volunteer information. Personally Identifiable Information might include your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address and other identification and contact information.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon how you navigate through our Site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop. 

**Why Do We Collect This Information?**   
Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide our users and members with a superior online experience. We collect Personally Identifiable Information to both credit your purchases through Cashbaq to your account, and to send rebate checks to your address. For members that elect to personalize their experience at Cashbaq, we use Personally Identifiable Information to provide that look and feel during their visits or to send e-mail regarding new coupons or cash back opportunities. Members can always choose to opt-out of any customization. We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information to continuously improve the content and navigation of our Web site. 

**Who Will Have Access To This Information?**   
Any information gathered by 77Blue is solely for our own use. We do not share this information with any third-party, and only a limited number of 77Blue employees have access to this information. We will not sell your information.

**Is This Information Secure?**  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, 77Blue has put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information it collects online. However, data security is a constantly evolving art and science. You should consider any communication that you transmit to 77Blue (such as data, questions or answers, comments, or suggestions) as non-confidential, and agree that 77Blue will not be liable or responsible if information that belongs to you is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient.

**Does 77Blue collect personally identifying information from or about children?**   
77Blue uses reasonable efforts not to collect, use or disclose individually identifiable information from children under the age of 13. The Services are not targeted at children, and children may not register for any portions of the Services that require registration. 

**How can I access or correct any personally identifying information about me?**   
Members can change their personal information at any time online. You may also request a copy of the personally identifiable information you have sent to 77Blue by sending an e-mail containing your request to [privacy@77blue.com](mailto:privacy@77blue.com). You must provide your full name and the e-mail from which the request is received (and to which the response will be sent) must match the e-mail address on file with 77Blue. You may then correct or delete such information using the procedures specified in the e-mail.

**Will this policy be updated?**   
While we may have to make updates to this policy, we are not going to change our commitment to protect your privacy. Any changes to this policy will be posted on this page.
