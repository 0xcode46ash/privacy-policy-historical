In this Privacy Policy, we would like to tell you what personal data we collect, what we use it for and when it may be disclosed.

By using [www.castlighthealth.com/](http://www.castlighthealth.com/) or <https://mycastlight.com/> (including their subpages, collectively, “Castlight Health Corporate Websites”), you are agreeing to Castlight’s [Terms of Service](http://www.castlighthealth.com/terms-of-service/) (which incorporates by reference this Privacy Policy) and to the practices described in this Privacy Policy, including consenting to the use and disclosure of certain information, including personal information provided to us as outlined in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only applies to the Castlight Health Corporate Websites.

This Privacy Policy describes how Castlight collects and uses the personal information you provide on the Castlight Health Corporate Websites or personal information we receive about you from third parties. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information.

If you have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, please contact us at Castlight Health, Inc., 150 Spear Street, Suite 400, San Francisco, CA 94105, Attn: Chief Privacy Officer or [privacy@castlighthealth.com](mailto:privacy@castlighthealth.com) or calling us at (888) 722-0483.

 

  1. **Collection of Information**.



We will not sell, share or rent personal information that is collected on the Castlight Health Corporate Websites in ways different than from what is disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

  2. **Information Collection, Use and Disclosure**


  * Information Requests. If you wish to request more information about Castlight, you are required to provide contact information (for example, name and email address). This information will be used by Castlight to contact you about our services.
  * Certain communications (for example, requests for more information) are recorded and maintained by Castlight. Castlight considers these communications to be personal and private and will not use or disclose these communications except as provided for in this Privacy Policy, where required by law, or unless you agree to additional use and disclosure of such information.
  * Log Files. As is true of most websites, Castlight automatically collects and stores in log files the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access the service; and the Internet address of the website from which you directly linked to Castlight. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. Castlight uses this log file information to analyze trends, monitor service traffic and usage patterns for internal marketing and security purposes, and to help make the Castlight Health Corporate Websites more useful.
  * Information from Third Parties. We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records or third parties may provide information in connection with a business relationship.



  Additionally, your information may also be used and disclosed as follows: 

  * Survey you to evaluate and improve the Castlight service. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and business address). We use this information to improve the service accuracy and develop new products. We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or fulfill any prizes associated with campaigns. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.
  * Locator information, which may include your name, email address, physical address, and/or other data that enables someone to personally identify you. Castlight and your Internet Access Provider may use locator information as is necessary to enforce any of the terms of the Castlight [Terms of Service](http://www.castlighthealth.com/terms-of-service/).
  * Provide access to gated areas of the Castlight Health Corporate Websites such as for webinars.
  * Operate the Castlight service.
  * Provide information as required by law.
  * Update you on the Castlight service and its benefits.

 
  3. **Disclosure of Information**


  * Compliance with Laws. Castlight will not disclose personal information to third parties other than as provided for in this Privacy Policy, except when required to do so by law such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, or you have otherwise consented to additional use or disclosure of the information. We may also disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, and if Castlight is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Castlight Health Corporate Websites of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
  * Third Parties Websites. If you use Castlight to link to another website, you may decide to disclose personal information at that website. For example, you might provide your contact information to obtain an information packet from an organization. Please be aware that in contacting that website, or in providing information on that website, that third party may obtain personal information about you. This Privacy Policy does not apply when you leave Castlight and go to a third party website from Castlight. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our service and to read the privacy policy of each and every website that collects personal information.
  * Service Providers. We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as marketing. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
