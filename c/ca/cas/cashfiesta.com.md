Your demographic information is the key to make you as a consumer happier and the advertiser more focused. In addition, we require user-specific information such as interests, gender, age, household income and education, which is used to build a profile of your interests and activity so that you can receive advertisement, offers and other benefits that are most likely to be of interest of you. We will ask you for this information when you register as a member. The only other piece of information that we require for sign up is your email address. We ask for this information to verify your identity and protect against fraud. For some promotions we may also request a valid phone number.
