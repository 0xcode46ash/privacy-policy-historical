**What Our Privacy Policy Covers**  
Our privacy policy will tell you how we handle your personally identifiable information. Since CashCrate deals in large part with third-party advertisers, you may be asked to give personally identifiable to those websites as well. CashCrate cannot be responsible for information given to those third-parties, and you should be sure to read their privacy policies. Please note: Unless otherwise noted, any offer you complete on CashCrate.com will be with a third-party. 

**What Information We Collect**  
CashCrate collects only information which you give us through the registration process and when updating your payment options. This information includes: your first and last name, your email address, your payment email (if you're using PayPal), and your IP address. Your IP address is recorded when you sign-up so that we can enforce our one account per person policy, and also to fight cheating. 

**Information Sharing & Disclosure**  
CashCrate will not share your personal information with any third-party for the purpose of advertising, i.e. sending unsolicited email. Your email address is used when completing offers for tracking purposes only--this is how we figure out who completed offers. Additionally, your information may be given to legal authorities or your ISP if you violate our [terms of service](https://web.archive.org/web/20060615012817id_/http%3A//cashcrate.com/terms.php) and undertake actions which are illegal, fradulent, or otherwise harmful to CashCrate, its users, or its advertisers. 

**Managing Your Information**  
You may update your information at anytime by editing your account under the "My Account" section in the Members Area. Additionally, you may [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20060615012817id_/http%3A//cashcrate.com/contact.php) and request that we update any part of your information.
