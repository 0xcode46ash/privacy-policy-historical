These aggregated statistics may be used internally to improve our Web Services and for product development and marketing purposes generally. The information we collect in Web server logs helps us administer our sites, analyze usage, protect the website and its content from inappropriate use, and improve user experience.  In addition, aggregated statistics (which contain no personally identifiable information) may also be provided to advertisers and other third parties.

  * **Location Information.**

If you elect to have a location-based search saved to your history, we will store that information on our servers. If you do not enable the location-based service, or if an application does not have that feature, the application will not transmit to us, and we will not collect or store, location information.

  * **Cookies and similar technologies**



In order to offer and provide a customized and personal service, we may use cookies to store and help track information about you, as well as Web beacons, HTML5 local storage and other similar technologies to manage access to and use of our Web Services, recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there.

We use cookies and similar technologies to help remind us who you are and to help you navigate our sites during your visits. Cookies allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so you won't have to reenter them each time you visit.

Internet cookies may save data about individual visitors, such as the visitor's name, password, user-name, shopping cart, screen preferences, the pages of a site viewed by the visitor, and the advertisements viewed or clicked by the visitor.

We also may use technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns for our Web Services, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our websites, and third party websites. In HTML emails that we send our visitors and users, we may use technical methods for a number of purposes, including: to determine whether our visitors and users have opened or forwarded those emails and/or clicked on links in those emails, to customize the display of banner advertisements and other messages after a visitor/user has closed the email, and to determine whether a visitor/user has made an inquiry or purchase in response to a particular email. These technical methods may enable us or our vendors to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable.

Our vendors may also transfer this information to other third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on our behalf. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of a Web Service.

**Use of Personal Data Collected**

Personal data collected by Wolters Kluwer Law & Business may be used for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users' behavior, for product development, for content improvement, to inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their advertisements, or to customize the content and layout of the applicable site or mobile application. The information collected by our Web Services also may be used for responding to your inquiries and otherwise corresponding with you, for processing transactions you request, maintaining your account (if you have one), for other purposes permitted by your organization's customer agreement(s) (if any) for products and services (including disclosure of personal information to the subscribing organization by agreement), to maintain the security and integrity of our Web Services for the purpose of conducting market research or surveys on our behalf, and for the administration, review and/or the improvement of the content of our Web Services.  Aggregate data on visitors' home servers may be used for internal purposes or provided to third parties, such as advertisers. Individually identifying information, such as names, postal and email addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to us may be added to our contact databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding site or application updates, new products and services, upcoming events, and status of orders placed online.  We also may enhance or merge your information collected with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you.

Wolters Kluwer sometimes collects non-identifiable information through our Web Services to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on our Web Services, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." We or others on our behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics in order to help us provide better customer service.

Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies.

We may use demographic and preference information to allow advertising on one or more of our Web Services that can be targeted to the users for whom they are most pertinent. This means users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads.

If there are advertisements on our Web Services, the advertiser(s) may be electronically notified when visitors view or click on its advertisements.

We may disclose information you provide to us to third parties in order to complete a transaction that you requested or as otherwise permitted by your organization's customer agreement(s) (if any).

These service providers are restricted from using this data in any way other than to provide services to us, and they may not share, resell or use the data for their own direct marketing purposes.

**Security Measures**

Wolters Kluwer Law & Business has implemented numerous security features to help protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For instance, when a visitor places an order on this site or application (if any) or accesses his or her account information (if any), we may offer the visitor the ability to use a secure server. A secure server encrypts information a visitor inputs before it is sent to us, and is also used to securely store personal information. Please be advised, however, that while Wolters Kluwer Law & Business has endeavored to create secure and reliable Web Services for visitors and users, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to/from us via our Web Services  or via e-mail cannot be guaranteed. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will always be unable to defeat our security measures. Accordingly, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business and our affiliates are not responsible for the security or confidentiality of information transmitted or accessible via the Internet.

We store the information about you in a data center with restricted access and appropriate monitoring, and we use a variety of technical security measures to secure your data. In addition, we use intrusion detection and virus protection software. We also maintain policies or practices designed to limit access to your personal information to employees who need access in order to carry out their job responsibilities.

Also, please note that we may store and process your personal information in systems located outside of your home country. However, regardless of where storage and processing may occur, we take appropriate steps designed to ensure that your information is protected, consistent with the principles set forth under this statement.

Your access to many of our Web Services and content may be password protected. You should take precautions to protect your user names and passwords, and we recommend that you refrain from disclosing your username(s) and password(s) to anyone. We also recommend that you sign out of your account or service at the end of each session.
