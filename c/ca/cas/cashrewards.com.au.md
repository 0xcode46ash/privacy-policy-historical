 **How does Cashrewards use the information I provide in the Account Settings and Rewards Profile?**

Cashrewards uses the information you provide in your Account Settings and Rewards Profile to target and personalise the emails, surveys and letters we send to you and the offers we make available to you. We do this to ensure that you only receive relevant and appropriate information. 

Demographic and profile data is only shared with Shopgo clients and advertisers on an aggregate or collective basis. For example, we might tell our clients that 2895 of our members live in a particular town or suburb, or that 37% of our members have indicated an interest in sport. 

Your personally identifiable information such as your name, address or email address will never be sold to any third party. Your personally identifiable information may be shared with a third party if it is required by law. Your personally identifiable information may also be shared with a third party (for example a supplier or partner of ours) if it is necessary for us to process a transaction that you request, or if you opt-in to a service or feature where we outsource some aspects of the provision of that service or feature. For example, if you opt in to the mobile rewards service, we may share your mobile number with a telecommunications company that sends messages to you on our behalf. We have strict legal agreements in place that prevent any third party from using that information more than once, or for any purpose beyond what is allowed for in the agreement. 

**What do you do with the answers I give in my online profile surveys ?**

You can be assured that any information you provide in our online profile survey is kept absolutely confidential. The results of this and other online surveys (where you are invited to participate in a survey by email) is used so we can make you rewards offers according to your specified interests and if it were shared with any third party, for example, Shopgo clients and advertisers, it would be shared on an aggregate or collective basis only. 

**Why does Cashrewards record IP Addresses?**

When a user joins Cashrewards, our computers may record their IP address. In the event that we detect fraud or abuse of our program or our Web site and computers, we may use the IP address of the offender to take action against them. Ultimately this ensures greater protection for you and your personal information. 

**What are cookies and why does Cashrewards use them?**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's computer hard drive, containing information about that user. A cookie can only be accessed across the Internet by the Web site that placed it there. Cookies are used by the Cashrewards Web site to add functionality and security. 

You may choose to reject a cookie that the Cashrewards Web site attempts to place on your computer, however you may then be limited in your use of some areas of the Web site. The use of cookies in this way is wide-spread and commonly accepted by the Internet community. 

**What about other Web sites?**

The Cashrewards Web site contains links to other Web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other Web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Web site to read the privacy statements of other Web sites that you use. This privacy statement applies only to Web sites owned and operated by Shopping Rewards Pty Ltd. 

**What is "spam" and does Cashrewards send it?**

The widely accepted definition of "spam" is unsolicited commercial email, or in other words, email of a commercial nature that the recipient does not want. Cashrewards does not send "spam". This is because when you join Cashrewards, you must expressly agree to allow us to send to you commercial advertising email. 

**How many emails will I receive?**

We respect your time and attention. We will never send to you more than ten advertising emails per week. You may also adjust your communications preferences by logging into your account settings at [MyRewards](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326180539id_/https%3A//www.cashrewards.com.au/members/)

Each non-administrative email we send to you contains a link at the very bottom allowing you to unsubscribe. 

If you have received unwanted email sent from Cashrewards, or purporting to be sent from Cashrewards, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326180539id_/https%3A//www.cashrewards.com.au/contact/)
