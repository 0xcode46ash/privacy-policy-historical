Effective Date: 10/30/2007

Cash4Gold(C4G) takes your privacy seriously. C4G makes this Web site available to consumers who are interested in obtaining information regarding obtaining cash for their scrap gold or jewelry. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting this website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice. 

  
**What This Privacy Policy Covers**

  * This policy covers how C4G treats personal information that C4G collects and receives; including information related to you’re past use of C4G products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, IP address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. Unless as otherwise described in this privacy policy, C4G will never share or rent your personal information.



  
**Information Collection and Use**

**General**

  * C4G collects personal information when you either register with C4G to receive a free Refiner’s Return Pak or when contact our toll free call center. 
  * When you register we ask for information such as your name, address, phone number, email address and zip code. Once you register with C4G and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. 
  * C4G automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address C4G cookie information, and the page you request. 
  * We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to C4G services, such as service announcements, administrative messages, special offers and trusted C4G partners. 
  * C4G collects personal information mainly for the purpose of distributing our Refiners Return Pak which is mailed to any address you wish. 



  
**Confidentiality and Security**

  * We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. 
  * We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you. 



**Cookies**

  * C4G may set and access C4G cookies on your computer. We use this information for Web Site and Systems Administration. 
  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features and storage of items between visits. 



** Tracking**

  *  We use a common technology known as a "Clear GIF" or "1-by-1 Pixel" on the Site and in e-mail communications with users. A Clear GIF, or "graphic interface format" is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1x1 pixel) that we (or our partners) place on a page of the Site. We may also occasionally place GIFs in e-mail messages that we send to users. GIFs, which do not contain personal information, provide us with important information about how users use the Site and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, we are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative e-mail presentations. We may also allow our advertisers and promotional partners the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track users who link from their respective sites to this Site, but this ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access to user personal information. 



  **Information Sharing and Disclosure**

  * Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing special offers and communicating with you. 
  * Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses this site. 
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, violations of C4G’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 
  * We transfer information about you if C4G is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, C4G will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
  * We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
  * C4G may share personal information about you with trusted partners who work on behalf of or with C4G. These companies may use your personal information to help BIG communicate with you about offers from C4G and our marketing partners. You may receive certain communications relating to C4G services, such as service announcements, administrative messages, special offers and a C4G Newsletter.
