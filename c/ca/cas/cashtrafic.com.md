Adcash is committed to protecting the privacy of online consumers. This document outlines our technology and the practises we use to collect information.

**Privacy Compliance**

Adcash does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from users. Adcash adheres to the privacy guidelines created by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and Direct Marketing Association (DMA).

**Information Collection**

Adcash is an advertising platorm. When you see an ad that has been served by Adcash.com, the website you are visiting has commissioned Adcash to act as an agent to deliver advertisements and report on advertising activity. The website you are visiting may be: a Adcash customer or a website who is selling ad space to one of Adcash's customers.

Adcash, through the use of cookies and pixel tags, collects anonymous usage statistics. These are industry standard technologies used by many major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. Information that is collected may include: session data, geography, browser information, IP address, operating system type.

**Do we use cookies?**

Yes. Cookies are small files that a site transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

Adcash uses cookies to enhance your browsing experience by preventing you from seeing the same advertisements repeatedly. Cookies can also be used for Pixel tracking which is explained below.

It is possible to tell your browser to reject cookies for all sites or specific sites. Rejecting cookies is not recommended however, as cookies are intended to improve your browsing experience. For more information about removing cookies, please see the "Opting Out" section below.

**Pixel Tracking**

To ensure the correct delivery and success of our customer's advertising campaigns, Adcash uses pixel tracking tags to measure usage statistics. Adcash customers will have their partner websites place these pixel tags on their websites. These tags allow Adcash software to measure non-personal behavioural patterns which indicate the success of the advertising. No personally identifiable information is collected during this process.

**Audience Pixels**

To ensure that users are getting the best quality of advertising, Adcash uses audience pixels to match ads to users. Audience pixels do not store any personally identifiable information, but allow Adcash to match a user who has previously been served an audience pixel when they are being served an advertisement.How it works: One of Adcash's clients places an audience pixel on their website. In the future, the Adcash system allows the advertiser to serve advertisements to users who have visited that webpage. Adcash and our clients do not collect any personally identifiable information and cannot. Adcash does not use this information for any other purpose than serving advertisements on behalf of its clients. Adcash clients do not have direct access to this data. If you would like to opt-out of Adcash's audience pixel technology please see instructions below in the "Opting Out" section.
