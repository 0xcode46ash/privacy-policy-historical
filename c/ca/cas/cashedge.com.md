| User ID and a Password that you create  
---|---  
  
(ii) 

| First and last name and e-mail account information   
  
(iii) 

| For basic security related data, such as, social security number, date of birth, city of birth and mothers maiden name.   
  
  
Your user profile information will allow us to authenticate and verify your identity so that you may indeed create an account with us to use our services. 

_We collect only such information as you knowingly provide to us or specifically authorize us to obtain on your behalf._

CashEdge aggregates information and allows you to transfer funds from bank, brokerages and other accounts that you have with various financial institutions. In order to provide our services, it is necessary for CashEdge to access your third party accounts at financial institutions on your behalf. To enable this access, you will need to provide us with all such information that is required by your financial institution, such as bank account numbers. We will use this information only on your behalf, to access your third party account and to carry out your instructions. Please know that when you provide us with your financial institution passwords, this information is completely encrypted in a manner that makes the actual password inaccessible to both CashEdge and its employees.  


**How CashEdge uses that Information and who has access to it:**

CashEdge uses your personal information to provide you with superior service: to help us service your account; to advise you about our products and services; and to inform you of any relevant promotions from our service partners and other relevant companies.

CashEdge does not sell or exchange your identity, any personally identifiable financial or otherwise information, or account login information, to any unaffiliated third party. We may share your personally identifiable information to verify your identity with and confirm that you own the accounts at the specific banks and financial institutions from which you choose to "aggregate" your accounts. Additionally, in the necessary course of delivering our services, and for internal risk management purposes (for example to confirm that you have sufficient funds to support substantial money transfers), we may share personally identifiable information with an intended partner to authenticate the information that you have supplied.

If you do not agree to the sharing of information per the aforesaid, we recommend that you do not sign-up for our service.

CashEdge reserves the right to share anonymous aggregated information with our financial institution partners. 

CashEdge reserves the right to disclose or report personally identifiable information as permitted by law (for example, if CashEdge has a "good faith belief" that it is required to do so in order to (i) comply with applicable law or with legal process (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of CashEdge; (iii) enforce the terms of this Policy or CashEdge's User Agreement, etc).

CashEdge will for the purpose of address and credit verification and risk management, where it is necessary, exchange information only with credit reporting agencies, reputable reference sources and clearinghouse services. 

CashEdge-authorized employees and customer service representatives will access your personal and financial information only when necessary to comply with your requests, maintain your accounts, or otherwise meet your needs. To keep your information secure, we require all of our employees to sign strict confidentiality agreements. Access to sensitive customer information such as customer bank balances and transaction details, is highly restricted and is limited to only authorized employees. 

**Choices Customers have:**

CashEdge will keep your personal and account information accurate and up to date. You can access, review and update your personal information at any time by clicking on " **Profile** ". You will not be able to make changes to your third party accounts at financial institutions through CashEdge. For any problems or to update your Profile you can notify us at [privacy@cashedge.com](mailto:privacy@cashedge.com).

CashEdge will from time to time extend to you certain targeted promotions. All promotions will emanate from CashEdge to you, and we willnot disclose personally identifiable information to extend these promotions from third parties. If you do not wish to receive any of the promotions offered, you can choose to opt-out at any time by notifying us either by writing at CashEdge, Inc., 694 Tasman Drive, Milpitas CA 95035, or by sending us an e-mail at [privacy@cashedge.com](mailto:privacy@cashedge.com).

**Security Measures that CashEdge has put in place to protect your information:**

CashEdge has multiple levels of security, designed especially by us. We take every precaution to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information, that information is encrypted and protected with the strongest encryption software available. Your information is protected both online and off-line using technologic and physical measures. For information on the specifics of our Security Architecture, please see [CashEdge's Security Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20010614053012id_/http%3A//www.cashedge.com/ce/policy/security.html).

The use of " Cookies" is an industry standard that refers to pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes. By storing information about your preferences on a particular site, many major Web sites use cookies to provide useful features for their customers. In our case we use "Cookies" to maintain session information for logged in members and to prevent the need for re-entry of login information. The "Cookies" used by CashEdge are present only when you are in session- they are deleted when you log off. CashEdge does not use "persistent" cookies (that is, cookies that remain after you log off) to store any personal information on the browser.

CashEdge places your personal and financial information on a secure portion of our Web site. Your CashEdge login name is always encrypted. Your CashEdge Password is one-way encrypted (this type of encryption prevents us from deciphering your CashEdge password). Your Financial Institution User IDs and Passwords are encrypted using your CashEdge password (this means that until you login to CashEdge and provide us with your password, CashEdge cannot decrypt the User ID and Password for your third party accounts). 

_Neither our software, nor that of our employees can decode this information at any time._

Your CashEdge password is your private key into your account. You must never share it with anyone and you should change it periodically. You can change your password at any time by clicking on " **Profile** ". PLEASE REMEMBER if you forget your password, we can reset your CashEdge account but you will have to re-enter the User ID's and Passwords for financial institutions, as we do not have access to this information.

After you have finished accessing your CashEdge account, please remember to log off. This prevents someone else from accessing your account.

To preserve your privacy, you will be logged off automatically when you have been inactive for a period of time. For secure access to your private information, you will need to log on again. For security reasons you will be denied access to your account after 3 unsuccessful log in attempts.
