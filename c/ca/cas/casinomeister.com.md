# Legal Statement and Privacy Policy at Casinomeister

**Email Addresses:** For each visitor to Casinomeister, our Webserver automatically recognizes only the visitor's domain name and the IP address, but not the email address.

However, we collect the email addresses of those who join our forum, the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, and email addresses volunteered by the visitors such as survey information and/or site registrations.

The email addresses are used to notify visitors about Casinomeister's newsletter or forum announcements. **They are not shared with any other organizations for commercial purposes**.

If you do not want to receive any email from us in the future, please contact me [here](http://www.casinomeister.com/forums/members/casinomeister.html).

**Other Collected Information:** Any other information we collect (Scavenger Hunt survey, Who Wants to be a Casinomeister? Bierfest, etc.) is used for internal purposes and used to improve the content of Casinomeister. It is then discarded. 

Upon request we provide visitors with access to unique identifier information (e.g., their personal login name or password) that we maintain about them, communications that the consumer/visitor has directed to our site (e.g., emails, customer inquiries), or contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number) that we maintain about them.

Consumers can access this information by contacting me [here ](http://www.casinomeister.com/forums/members/casinomeister.html). 

Upon request we offer visitors the ability to have inaccuracies corrected in contact information, or unique identifiers.

**Cookies:**  
Cookies are used in our banner serving software and in our forum. No information is obtained from the user except information from the users' browsers to ensure that different banners are displayed while the user navigates through the site. Cookies used in the forum enable users to have their browsers remember their passwords. This can be turned off by the user in "user control panel" in the forum.

**Security:**   
We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site.

If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact me [here](http://www.casinomeister.com/forums/members/casinomeister.html).
