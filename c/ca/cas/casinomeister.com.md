Legal Information Is Not Legal Advice  
---  
The information provided on Casinomesiter.com is not intended to be legal advice, but merely conveys general information related to the Casino Industry. The contents do not constitute legal advice and should not be relied upon as such. Legal information is not the same as legal advice -- the application of law to an individual's specific circumstances. Although we go to great lengths to make sure our information is accurate and useful, we recommend you consult a lawyer if you want professional assurance that our information, and your interpretation of it, is appropriate to your particular situation.

In addition, The information contained herein is not guaranteed to be correct, complete, or current. We make no warranty, expressed or implied, about the accuracy or reliability of the information at this website or at any other website to which this site is linked.   
  
"Pitch a Bitch" section - dealing with player complaints  
---  
Casinomeister does not give personal advice on how to handle player disputes. No funds whatsoever pass through Casinomeister from an operator to the player or visa versa. Casinomeister busts no kneecaps nor does Casinomester make veiled threats of roguedom if casinos don't consider player grievances. Casinomeister’s mission is to provide information and post complaints to help eradicate fraud. Our "Pitch a Bitches" section was developed so that the free flow of information, both good and bad, would protect the consumer. 

Naturally, if casinos are non-responsive or are behaving badly, they'll be thrown into the rogue pit.
