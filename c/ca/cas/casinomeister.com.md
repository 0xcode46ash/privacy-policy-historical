**WARNING:** Casinomeister.com does not intend for any of the information contained on this website to be used for illegal purposes. You must ensure you meet all age and other regulatory requirements before entering a casino or placing a wager. Online gambling is illegal in many jurisdictions and users should consult legal counsel regarding the legal status of online gambling and gaming in their jurisdictions. 

The information in this site is for news and entertainment purposes only. Casinomeister.com is an independent directory and information service not affiliated with any casino.

Legal Information Is Not Legal Advice  
---  
The information provided on Casinomesiter.com is not intended to be legal advice, but merely conveys general information related to the Casino Industry. The contents do not constitute legal advice and should not be relied upon as such. Legal information is not the same as legal advice -- the application of law to an individual's specific circumstances. Although we go to great lengths to make sure our information is accurate and useful, we recommend you consult a lawyer if you want professional assurance that our information, and your interpretation of it, is appropriate to your particular situation.

In addition, The information contained herein is not guaranteed to be correct, complete, or current. We make no warranty, expressed or implied, about the accuracy or reliability of the information at this website or at any other website to which this site is linked.   
  
"Pitch a Bitch" section - dealing with player complaints  
---  
Casinomeister does not give personal advice on how to handle player disputes. No funds whatsoever pass through Casinomeister from an operator to the player or visa versa. Casinomeister busts no kneecaps nor does Casinomeister make veiled threats of roguedom if casinos don't consider player grievances. Casinomeister’s mission is to provide information and post complaints to help eradicate fraud. Our "Pitch a Bitches" section was developed so that the free flow of information, both good and bad, would protect the consumer. 

Naturally, if casinos are non-responsive or are behaving badly, they'll be thrown into the rogue pit.   
  
Trademark  
---  
Casinomeister® is a registered trademark protected in the US, all member states of the EU, the Russian Federation, and Australia. If this trademark is infringed, we will aggressively enforce our intellectual property rights to the fullest extent of the law, including the seeking of civil remedies and criminal prosecution.

**Email Addresses:** For each visitor to Casinomeister, our Webserver automatically recognizes only the visitor's domain name and the IP address, but not the email address.

However, we collect the email addresses of those who join our forum, our newsletters, our promotions, and those who communicate with us via email.

The email addresses are used to notify visitors about Casinomeister's newsletter or forum announcements. **They are not shared with any other organizations for commercial purposes**.

We reserve the right to publish the email addresses of those who post spam in our forum, or who send us abusive "fan" mail. 

**Other Collected Information:**   
If a member submits a complaint via our "Pitch a Bitch" complaint service, that player gives us explicit permission to share his personal information with the casino in question. The casino in turn is allowed to share information with us concerning this individual, and any information they feel is necessary to assist in the resolution process. This mutual agreement is acknowledged during the submission phase of the complaint. 

Upon request we provide visitors with access to unique identifier information (e.g., their personal login name or password) that we maintain about them, communications that the consumer/visitor has directed to our site (e.g., emails, customer inquiries), or contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number) that we maintain about them.

Cookies used in the forum enable users to have their browsers remember their passwords. This can be turned off by the user in "user control panel" in the forum. We also use cookies to ensure you have only one account in our forum. If you wish to have more than one account in our forum (business and civilian, etc.), or you share your computer with your wife, boyfriend, pet goat, and they would like to open an account, please contact us.
