### Cookies

Our website may use cookies. Cookies are small data files generated by web servers and stored in your computer for future access. We use them for a variety of reasons, such as to study visitors’ use of the site and to improve your navigation of it. The majority of Web browsers accept cookies, but the “help” menu on your browser should give you options for preventing, accepting, or receiving notice of new cookies. You can configure your web-browser to disable cookies, but doing so may impair your use of the site.

### Security of Information

Castle takes reasonable precautions to ensure the safety and security of information we collect; however, there is no fail-safe system that guarantees absolute security for web-based businesses due to the constant evolution of technology. Although security measures are in place, Castle cannot guarantee that a breach of security from an unauthorized outside agent will not occur. Castle agrees to keep all of its data security technology and software up-to-date as is commercially reasonable to ensure the protection of the material.

California residents have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship, (a) a list of the categories of personal information, such as name, e-mail and mailing address and the type of services provided to the customer, that a business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes and (b) the names and addresses of all such third parties.
