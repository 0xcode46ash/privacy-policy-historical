### Disclosure of your information

We follow strict guidelines in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access. We comply with the laws of the countries from which we operate.

They supply the hardware infrastructure, storage and associated services necessary for us to provide the Service. All data submitted to third parties will be encrypted using SSL technology.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 



Please note that this may include the transfer of your personal data to one or more countries outside the UK.

By using the Website and/or the Service you consent to our third party service partners having access to your personal data, including those outside the European Economic Area (EEA). We always ensure that your data is only transferred in full accordance with UK data protection laws. In particular, this means that your data will only be transferred to a country that provides an adequate level of protection (for example, because the European Commission has determined that a country provides an adequate level of protection). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the processing of your payment details and the storage of your personal data. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. You agree to keep confidential and not to disclose to any other individual or individuals for all time the user name and password related to your Capsule account. 

### About Cookies

A cookie is a text-only string of information that is stored by your browser when you navigate around a website. Cookies are required to use the Capsule CRM service and are used in the following ways: 

  * To keep a session open after a user logs in.
  * To compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our site and to help us improve the structure of our website. We cannot identify you personally in this way. 
  * When a user has enabled 'Remember Me on This Computer' a cookie allows the user to access their account without logging in each time. This cookie is removed when the user explicitly logs out. 



These cookies contain no personal information, but clearly users shouldn't enable 'Remember Me' when using a publicly-accessible computing device or terminal.

### You own your data

Our Service, Capsule, is an online customer relationship management system which stores information as provided or entered by you (company or individual). We will only store information that is entered by the users of your organisation, or automatically imported at a user’s instruction. The data entered, or imported on instruction, by the users of an organisation remains the property of you and we will not use nor make available for use any of this information without permission of you. 

### You control who has access to your data

The data entered, or imported on instruction, by the users of your organisation is stored securely in a database and is only accessible to the approved users of your organisation. Your administrator (the “Administrator”) will have full control over who is invited to be a user. A user name and password is required in order to access your information in the Service. 

It is the user’s responsibility to keep their passwords safe. It is the Administrator’s responsibility to ensure that any users that are invited to use the Service have permission to view the your information stored in the Service. Neither our staff nor our third party service partners have access to any user passwords and are therefore unable to access the organisation’s account or data without receiving an invitation from the Administrator. 

You represent, warrant and undertake that when using the Service you will at all times comply with all applicable local and national laws including but not limited to those relating to privacy and the processing of personal data and other information. You agree to promptly comply with any request from us requiring you to amend, transfer and/or delete any information recorded by you on our Service. You also agree to provide us with full co-operation and assistance in relation to any complaint, notice or communication which relates directly or indirectly to the processing of personal data or other information or to your compliance with any applicable local and national laws. 

You agree to indemnify us and keep us indemnified and defend us at your own expense against all costs, claims, damages or expenses incurred by us or for which the we may become liable due to any failure by you (or your employees or agents (where applicable)) to comply with your obligations under this Privacy Policy. 

### Your data is sent securely across the internet

Our servers use SSL security certificates so all data transferred between your users and our servers is encrypted. However, the internet is not in itself a secure environment. Users should only enter, or instruct the importation of, data to the database within a secure environment. This means that the user’s browser must support the encryption security used in connection with our servers. 

### We will give you access to your data at any time

On request, we will provide the Administrator with a full export of your data in a common file format determined by us.

Your data may be permanently deleted by us after you stop paying to use the Service, or at the Administrator’s request.

### We monitor system usage

We have access to and may use aggregate information such as number of associated users, number of transactions and billing information for the purpose of billing and monitoring server and software performance as well as for other internal purposes. 

We will never access the details of any information entered and stored in the Service. We will never access system usage history for a specific identifiable user, except where granted permission by the user to assist with resolution of a system issue or error. 

Our staff may access non-identifying and aggregated usage information and transaction volumes in order to better understand how our customers are using the Service so we can improve the system design and where appropriate have the system prompt users with suggestions on ways to improve their own use of the system. All aggregated usage information is stored in a secure data warehouse facility. 

### You are responsible for checking the privacy policy of any third-party websites we link to

Our Website may contain links to third-party websites. We take no responsibility for the privacy practices or content of these websites. 

### This policy may be updated from time to time

We reserve the right to change this policy at any time and any amended policy will be posted on our Website.

For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998, the data controller is Zestia Limited, a private limited company registered in England with number 06418281 whose registered office is at The Old Workshop, 12B Kennerleys Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire. SK9 5EQ.
