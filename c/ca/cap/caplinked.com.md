# Terms of Use - Privacy Policy - Disclaimer | CapLinked

CapLinked, Inc. (“us,” “we,” or “Company”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the Company’s web-based software (the “Service”). We created this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to give you confidence as you use the Service, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy.

### PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

In using our Service, you may be requested to provide certain information such as your name, address (postal and email), telephone number and billing/payment details (including credit card information). This information is stored in our database.  
**We do not sell or license personally identifiable information to third parties.** We may use personally identifiable information to administer and improve the Services, customer support, to send you information about CapLinked or its Service, to contact you when necessary and for such other purposes as you may consent. We also share personal information with our business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to our Services. Those business partners have all agreed to uphold similar standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use such information to carry out their specific business obligations to the Company.

### COOKIES

We use “cookies” to collect information and to provide you with a better service. We may customize content specific to your interests, store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Service, and promote our Service to you. You can instruct your computer to not accept cookies; however, if you do so, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.

### SECURITY

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us. CapLinked uses reasonable measures to safeguard personally identifiable information, which measures are appropriate to the type of information maintained, and follows applicable laws regarding safeguarding any such information under our control. CapLinked uses certain trusted third party companies to provide and improve the Service, including data storage and hosting operations. These third parties may have access to your information only for the purposes of performing tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy. While CapLinked believes that it has taken reasonable steps to secure data collected from its customers, no security system is impenetrable. Each user is responsible for protecting his, her or its own username and password from third party access, and for selecting passwords that are secure. Each user must promptly notify us if their user name or password is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that user name or password from your account and update our records accordingly. The Service may contain links to third party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

### CONFIDENTIALITY

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect and safeguard all personal information against unauthorized use, publication or disclosure, and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies in connection with an investigation or to protect the security or integrity of our Service and website. Information that you store or exchange on the Service will immediately become available to those whom you have authorized to view such information, and CapLinked is not responsible for the privacy or disclosure practices of such recipients. We restrict access by our personnel to such information except as necessary to maintain and provide the Service or if the customer requests our assistance. If CapLinked is involved in a business divestiture, change of control, sale, merger, or acquisition of all or a part of its business, we reserve the right to transfer your information. We will notify you of any change in control of your Personal Information and any choices you may have regarding the information.

### CHANGES IN YOUR INFORMATION

You may update or correct your personal information and email preferences at any time by logging in to your account and editing your Settings. You can review and correct the information about you that CapLinked keeps on file by contacting us directly at

### UPDATES AND CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY

If we change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on the Service. Such changes are effective when posted on this page. By continuing to use the Service after the changes are made, you agree to be bound by the updated Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at
