# Privacy Policy - Cappex

This Privacy Policy also applies to the use of the CappexConnect Service and all virtual events conducted by Cappex and its sponsoring educational institutions. Please read this policy carefully before sharing any of your personally identifiable information with us.

Cappex goes to great lengths to respect and protect your privacy. Except in connection with the use of the CappexConnect Service (in which information may be shared as set forth below), we promise that we will not knowingly share your contact information with a college, university, educational institution, sponsor or advertiser without your permission or as may be provided in this Privacy Policy.

Because our services require us to collect some fairly detailed personal and/or financial information, we want you to have the information you need to make an informed decision about sharing information with us. This Privacy Policy will outline our practices and procedures we follow when handling information input through our Cappex Sites and the CappexConnect Service.

### 1\. Types of Information We Collect

Information is collected from our users at several different points during visits to a Cappex Site or attending a virtual online fair or other event hosted through the CappexConnect Service.

Registration \- Each user must register in order to use the Cappex Sites and CappexConnect Service.

During the registration process, you are required to provide certain information, such as name, address, e-mail address, a password, date of birth, gender, country of citizenship, educational background, grades, and extracurricular activities. In addition, you may choose to provide other information, such as intended major, career objectives, hobbies and other interests. This information may be updated and amended at any time after the initial registration. Cappex encourages its users to provide these fields of information so you may maximize the effectiveness of our college search and matching services. If you will be applying for financial assistance, certain financial and other information regarding you and your family will also need to be provided.

You may also elect to register for our service using an account you already have with certain third-party social networking sites ("SNS") (including, but not limited to, Facebook). For example, Cappex allows you to create an account and login to Cappex using your Facebook account credentials through Facebook Connect. If you are not currently registered as a user on Cappex and you click on "Sign Up Using Facebook," you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join Cappex.

During the registration process and certain other points when using a Cappex Site, you may be asked if you would like to receive information and/or marketing messages from third parties that have products or services which may be of interest to you. If you consent to receiving these messages, we may share your personally identifiable information with third parties to enable then to contact you for these purposes. At any time, you may prospectively [opt-out](https://web.archive.org/page/account/optout.jsp) of Cappex sharing your information with third parties for the third party products and services.

If your high school or community-based college access program provided your information to Cappex as part of a relationship between your high school or college access program, a connection may be automatically made between you and your assigned mentor(s) or guidance counselor(s). The information these connected individuals may have includes the personally-identifiable data such as name, address, phone number, email address, grades, schools that are interested in you, schools you are interested in, and other information you have provided to us or that we have collected.
