**Capitol Advantage Privacy Policy**

Capitol Advantage is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This document sets out our privacy policy and explains what we do with the personal information that we collect from our users. Please read this statement to understand our views and practices regarding personal information, and how they pertain to you as you use our CapWiz service. If we make any substantive changes to this policy, we'll post it on the site. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact the Capitol Advantage privacy coordinator at [privacy@capitoladvantage.com](mailto:privacy@capitoladvantage.com).

**What information does Capitol Advantage gather about you and how do we use it?**

When you send a message to a government official or media contact through Capitol Advantage, we ask for your name, address and e-mail address. We also collect the full text of the message you send through our service. We use this information to deliver your message and to identify you to the recipient.

If you sign-up for MegaVote, a weekly e-mail report of key Congressional votes, we ask for your ZIP code and e-mail address in order to identify your members of Congress and send you a weekly message about how they voted on key legislation.

If you use our Tell-a-Friend feature to e-mail a link to Capitol Advantage to a friend, you will need to provide us with both your email address as well as that of your friend. We will automatically send your message to this person, as well as invite them to visit the site. We use this information for the sole purpose of sending this e-mail.

If you click the Remember Me option, we will place a cookie in your browser to remember your personal information. This cookie is a file that contains your name, address, and e-mail address information as you entered it on the message form. The next time you send a message, Capitol Advantage will retrieve that information from the cookie and automatically enter it on the message form for you. A couple things to remember about cookies: Cookies are stored on your hard drive-not on our site. Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to refuse cookies or to notify you when you've received one. If you reject cookies, though, you will not be able to use the Remember Me feature.

We also collect IP addresses to help us understand how our visitors access our site, so we can make our site easier to find and to improve our users' overall experience when they visit Capitol Advantage.

**Will Capitol Advantage disclose any of your personal information?**

Capitol Advantage discloses your name, address, and e-mail address to the recipient of the message you send through our service. This information is required because most government officials and media contacts will not accept messages they receive from unidentified correspondents.

When you submit your message for inclusion in our online "Letters to Leaders" section, the text of your message and your city of residence will be displayed online. No personal information about you will be disclosed to the public as long as you do not include that information in the body of the message.

Capitol Advantage will not disclose any information about individual users, except as described in this Privacy Statement, or to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of Capitol Advantage.

We do not give, rent, lend, or sell individual information to any third parties other than as described above. We may occasionally disclose aggregate information in order to describe our service to prospective business partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. For example, we might tell them that there are 100,000 people in Gotham City who wrote a message to Congress, but we won't tell them that Batman is one of them, and we certainly won't tell them that his email address is "bwayne@batcave.com" or what he wrote in his messages. In this process, third parties never have access to any personal information about you.

**Will Capitol Advantage use your information for direct mailings?**

We will never send you offers or information about products or services of ours nor of any third party.

Capitol Advantage will contact you via e-mail for the following reasons:

* To send you a copy of a message you have sent through our service.  
* To send you a weekly MegaVote report, only if you have signed up for this service.

**What else should you know about your privacy?**

Keep in mind that your name, address, and e-mail address, as well as any information about yourself that you include in the messages you send through Capitol Advantage, will be read by the recipient of your message and/or his or her staff. That's really the point of our service - to enable you to communicate with your elected officials. Remember that whenever you disclose personal information in your messages you send to others, that information can be collected and used by the recipients and may even be forwarded to other parties.

Furthermore, while we do our best to protect your personal information, Capitol Advantage cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
