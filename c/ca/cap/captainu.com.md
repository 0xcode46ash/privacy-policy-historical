Welcome to CaptainU.com, a Web-based communication tool for high school and youth club soccer players, college soccer coaches, and high school and club soccer coaches, operated by CaptainU, LLC (“CaptainU”). To enrich our members' experience, we request and display some personal information to other members and visitors, which allows our Users to identify each other and expand their network. CaptainU members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other members and CaptainU communicate with them. 

CaptainU is committed to respecting the privacy of our Users. We strive to provide a safe, secure User experience. This Privacy Statement sets forth the online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply to CaptainU Tools and do not apply to information we collect in any other fashion.

**Collection and Use of Information by CaptainU.** In some areas of CaptainU, we request or may request that you provide personal information, including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, contact information, billing information and any other information from which your identity is discernible. In other areas, we collect or may collect demographic information that is not unique to you such as your ZIP code, age, preferences, gender, interests and favorites. Sometimes we collect or may collect a combination of the two types of information. 

We also collect certain information about your use of CaptainU, such as what areas of the website you visit and the hardware and software you use to access CaptainU. This information may include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring websites. This information is not linked to your personal information.

We may sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive, cultural, behavioral, preferential and/or life style information about yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Privacy Statement. 

We may also use a User's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding CaptainU. Users may choose not to receive email of this type by changing their "notification" setting in the User "Account Settings."

**User Content.** User Content (as defined in the CaptainU Terms of Use) is posted on CaptainU at your own risk. Although we limit access to certain pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content. 

Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on CaptainU is a violation of the CaptainU Terms of Use and should be reported to [info@captainu.com](mailto:info@captainu.com).

**User invitations.** If you use our Invite feature to tell a friend about CaptainU, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. CaptainU stores this information to send this one-time email, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the outcomes of User invitations. Your friend may contact us at [info@captainu.com](mailto:info@captainu.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

**Use of Cookies.** We use "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your experience on CaptainU. A cookie is a standard technology that is used by many websites. It is a small piece of data that is sent from a web server and stored on a User’s web browser. We use the information we obtain from cookies to improve the usability of the Website. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize CaptainU pages, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information. Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. When you return to CaptainU, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. We also use cookies to track click streams and for load balancing.

You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience with CaptainU.

**Posting to Public Areas of CaptainU.** Please remember that if you post any of your personal information in public areas of CaptainU, such as message boards, and other public forums, such information may be collected and used by others over whom we have no control. We are not responsible for the use made by third parties of information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of CaptainU.

All notification emails and CaptainU newsletters also include the above instructions for opting-out of those communications in the future.

**Sharing and Disclosure of Information CaptainU Collects.** Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement and the Terms of Use Agreement, CaptainU will not disclose personal information to any third party who is not a User unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by CaptainU, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the CaptainU Terms of Use Agreement or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and CaptainU Users. CaptainU reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of CaptainU or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest

**Security of the Personal Information.** We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. When you use CaptainU’s electronic commerce feature, your credit card information is protected through the use of Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") encryption. SSL makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted. We use a leading e-commerce service company to process all credit card transactions. 

**Third Party Advertising.** Advertisements that appear on our website may be delivered to Users by CaptainU or one of our advertising partners and may contain cookies. These cookies allow us to deliver targeted advertisements that we believe will be of most interest to you.
