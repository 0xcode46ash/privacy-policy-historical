# Data Protection and Privacy Policy | Capital Spreads

## Data Protection Act

LCG may process information relating to you (including personal data as defined under the Data Protection Act 1998), including holding such information in a manual format or electronic database, in order to satisfy any contractual, regulatory or statutory requirements we may have. Unless we receive specific written instructions to the contrary, by providing this information you agree that we may process this information in order to fulfill such obligations.

## Privacy Policy

**Introduction:**  
Protecting the security and privacy of your personal information is important to LCG and to the way it conducts its business in compliance with laws on privacy, data protection and data security. LCG hopes the policy outlined below will help you understand what information LCG may collect, how it uses and safeguards that information and with whom it may share it.

At LCG, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity in our business. In the course of our business, it is necessary to collect Personal Information about our potential clients. We take this activity seriously and seek to provide fair, secure and appropriate methods for the handling of Personal Information. All such activities are intended to be consistent with both generally accepted privacy ethics and standard business practices. Your Personal Information may be shared with a limited number of trusted partners and/or affiliates of LCG where such use is restricted to the management of your account and will not breach any elements of the UK Data Protection Act 1998.

If you have any questions or comments about LCG’s Privacy Policy, you can contact our Customer Support Team: [support@capitalspreads.com](mailto:support@capitalspreads.com ) or +44 (0)20 7456 7020 

**Personally Identifiable Information**  
Through its websites, LCG will not collect any personally identifiable information about you (e.g. your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address ("personal information")), unless you voluntarily choose to provide it (e.g. by registration, email enquiry, survey). If you do not want your personal information collected, please do not submit it. When you do provide personal information, LCG usually uses it to respond to your enquiry, or provide you access to specific account information, and to support its customer relationship with you.

LCG may store and process personal information and share it within the LCG group of companies to better understand your business needs and how LCG can improve its products and services; or LCG (or a third party on its behalf) may use Personal Information to contact you about a LCG offer in support of your business needs or to conduct online surveys to understand better its customers' needs and profiles.

If you choose not to have your personal information used to support its customer relationship programmes (especially direct-marketing or market-research), LCG will respect your choice. LCG do not now (and do not intend to in the future) sell, rent or otherwise market your personal information to third parties.

You may opt out of receiving marketing emails at any time by selecting the 'unsubscribe' link at the top of the emails or by emailing [support@capitalspreads.com](mailto:support@capitalspreads.com ) with your request.

**Children**  
No personal information should be submitted to LCG’s websites by children without the consent of their parent or guardian. LCG encourages all parents or guardians to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of their personal information while using the Internet. LCG will not knowingly collect or use any personal information collected from children for any purpose whatsoever, including disclosure to third parties.

**Non-Personal Information Collected Automatically**  
When you access its websites, LCG may automatically (i.e. not by registration) collect information that is not personally identifiable (e.g. type of Internet browser and computer operating system used; domain name of the website from which you came; number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed). LCG may use this information and share it within the LCG group to measure the use of its website and improve its content.

**Third Party Sites**  
This web site contains links to other web sites. Please be notified that LCG cannot be held responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage all visitors to be aware and read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

**Privacy Statement Changes**  
LCG may change this privacy statement at any time. You are advised to read this statement each and every time you access the site so that you are satisfied with the privacy conditions under which you provide LCG with your personal information.

**UK Data Protection Act 1998**  
The Government of the United Kingdom passed a Data Protection Act in 1998. LCG is bound to comply with the principles of good practice in the processing of personal data. Details of Data Protection registration may be found on their website [www.dpr.gov.uk](http://www.dpr.gov.uk/)

**Retention of records**  
We will keep Personal Information only as long as it is necessary, including for the purposes of updating the product or services or as required by law. When the Personal Information is no longer required, it will be destroyed either by shredding or other approved destruction methods to prevent unauthorised parties from gaining access to the information during and after the process.  
We will safeguard information in our custody.

**Security**  
LCG takes precautions to ensure the security of your personal information and strives to keep it accurate. LCG carefully protects your personal information from loss, destruction, falsification, manipulation, and unauthorised access or unauthorised disclosure and has developed and will maintain security procedures to safeguard Personal Information against loss, theft, copying, and unauthorised disclosure, use or modification. Access to Personal Information is restricted to employees and authorised service providers who need it to perform their work.
