# Privacy Policy | Capital New York

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available at the bottom of every regular page in our global footer.

  **The Information We Collect**    
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on capitalnewyork.com. On some pages, you can make comments, complete a user profile and register to receive newsletters and other digital messaging. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

Name  
Address  
Email address

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads and/or collect anonymous information when you visit our Web site. These companies may collect and use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third-party web beacon to collect this information. If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of this type of advertising, you can visit [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

 **The Way We Use Information**  
  We use the information you provide about yourself when interacting on the site only to provide you with the services you sign up for and, in some cases, to validate your preferred point of delivery. We do not share this information with third parties.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with third parties.

  You can register with our website if you would like to receive our newsletter, breaking news alerts, our weekly news summary newsletter,  as well as updates on our new products and services.

Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form.

  We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

 **Our Commitment To Data Security**  
To prevent unauthorized access and maintain data accuracy, the information we collect from users is stored on and retrieved over a secured, private network.

 **Our Commitment To Children's Privacy**  
  Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.  

 **How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information**  
You can access and correct all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging in and changing your user profile or by emailing us at info@capitalnewyork.com.  We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

 **How To Contact Us**  
  Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please send us an email at info@capitalnewyork.com.
