We also maintain a record of your product purchases. Whether or not to provide such information is completely your own choice. But if you choose not to provide the information we request, we may not be able to process your order or provide the services required. 

**Cookies**

No Personally Identifiable Information about your visits to our Website is collected during this process. However, if you do not wish to share this anonymous information you can opt-out by disabling or not allowing cookies in your browser.

**Using information**  
We use the personal information you provide for internal purposes only, to process and fulfill your order, to notify you of your order status, to fulfill or respond to your request, to inform you of new products, services and offers, to provide you with information about Cafe Britt and advertise diverse Café Britt promotions through the internet, to shape our recommendations about coffee or related items that might be of interest to you, and to analyze trends and statistics that will help us develop the design and layout of the website that will make your shopping experience a convenient and useful one. 

 Persons who provide us with their telephone numbers will only be contacted regarding orders or general Customer Service Purposes.

**Protecting Children**  
Cafe Britt takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of children. Our web site is a general audience site. Don’t forget, Cafe Britt is a great resource for all kinds of research projects on coffee. We’d love to hear from you and your children. Cafe Britt encourages children under 16 to get their parents permission before contacting us or submitting any information to us. Of course, there is nothing better than personal supervision of children while they surf the Internet.  

**Security**  
When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. All your personal information is encrypted before it is transmitted over the Internet. If you prefer not to enter your credit card online, you can call or fax in your credit information after you place your order online. Call us at 1-800-GO BRITT (1-800 462-7488) in the US and Canada; or fax us at 1-800-652-5679.  
Note: Most banks either cover all the charges that result from unauthorized use of your credit card or limit your liability to US$50, the maximum liability allowed under the Fair Credit Billing Act. You must notify your credit card provider of the unauthorized use in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures. 

**Disclosure to outside third parties**  
Cafe Britt respects your privacy. Any information you give us is held with the utmost care and security, and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented. However Cafe Britt may share non-personal aggregate, or summary, information regarding its customers with partners or other third parties, but Cafe Britt does not sell or share any information at the individual customer level. Cafe Britt cannot control and thus assumes no responsibility in relation with the use third parties may give to information they collect in contests run as co-promotions.
