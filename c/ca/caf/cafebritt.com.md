There may be times (such as when you purchase or order a product, subscribe to a service, or participate in contests, sweepstakes or promotions, etc.) at which we ask you to provide certain information about yourself, such as your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, email address and credit card information. We also maintain a record of your product purchases. Whether or not to provide such information is completely your own choice. But _if you choose not to provide the information we request, we may not be able to process your order_ or provide the services required.

### Protecting Children

Cafe Britt takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of children. Our web site is a [General Audience](https://www.truste.org/docs/How_to_Comply_with_COPPA.doc) site. Don't forget, Cafe Britt is a great resource for all kinds of research projects on coffee. We'd love to hear from you and your children. Cafe Britt encourages children under 16 to get their parents permission before contacting us or submitting any information to us. Of course, there is nothing better than personal supervision of children while they surf the Internet.

### Security

When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. All your personal information is encrypted before it is transmitted over the Internet.

You must notify your credit card provider of the unauthorized use in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.

### Disclosure to Outside Third Parties

**Cafe Britt respects your privacy**. Any information you give us is held with the utmost care and security, and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented. However Cafe Britt may share non-personal aggregate, or summary, information regarding its customers with partners or other third parties, but Cafe Britt does not sell or share any information at the individual customer level.
