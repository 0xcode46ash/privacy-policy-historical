This Privacy Policy explains Cafe.com's data collection and use practices generally and in connection with advertising and content and any related services offered on the Site (collectively, the "Services"). The Policy applies to the Site and to any other online or offline Cafe.com websites, including websites owned and controlled by Cafe.com.

The terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the visitor, customer and/or purchaser utilizing our Site. The terms “Cafe.com”, "Cafe", "we," "us," and "our" refer to Cafe.com and its subsidiaries and affiliates.

WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED? 

Personal Information  
"Personally Identifiable Information" is any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an e-mail address, phone number or other contact information, whether at work or at home. Cafe.com may request Personally Identifiable Information from you when you register to use our Site and Services and at various other locations on our Site, such as in online stores, message boards, personal pages, blogs and surveys. If you do not want your Personally Identifiable Information collected, please do not submit it to us. In certain areas, you may choose to allow other Cafe.com users to see the registration information you provide. In such cases, we will notify you during the registration process and allow you to determine the information you wish to be displayed. When you do provide us with Personally Identifiable Information, we may use that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and Services (as described in more detail below).If we ever send you information by e-mail concerning new products or Services that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future notices.

Non-Personal Information  
Non-personally identifiable information ("Non-Personal Information") is information that, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you use, demographic information (your age, gender, income, education, profession, zip code, etc.), the date and time you visited our Site, the pages you accessed, the name of the website from which you linked to our Site and other anonymous data involving your use of our Site. We use this information to analyze trends and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. For example, we collect information regarding your hardware configuration, including but not limited to OS version, type of coding for video, processor, memory size, explorer version, video card type and sound card type, so that we can confirm that the videogames are being installed in accordance with our End User License Agreement accessible at <http://www.cafe.com/BottomLinks/EULA.aspx> and to communicate you about updates or changes in policies and changes to our Services. This information is not linked to any Personally Identifiable Information.

HOW IS SUCH INFORMATION USED? 

We gather the information discussed above for purposes of providing and improving our Services. Personally Identifiable Information is used in order to register you as a user of the Site and Services, to set up your payment for the Services and to give us a sense of who our customers are and what are customers are looking for from our Site, Services and products.

IS THE INFORMATION SHARED OR DISCLOSED? 

Safeguarding your information is important to us, and we are not in the business of selling that information to others. Cafe.com shares your Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personal Information only as described in this Policy. Cafe.com reserves the right to share some of the information you provide with third parties. For example, from time to time, Cafe.com may disclose the information it collects to third parties it hires to assist it in serving you (e.g., fulfilling orders, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, providing customer service).Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, Cafe.com may disclose Personally Identifiable Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:  
(1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a current judicial proceeding, court order or legal process;  
(2) protect and defend the rights or property of Cafe.com; or   
(3) protect the personal safety of users of Cafe.com, its websites or the public.

ACCESS AND CHOICE.

You may update, correct, or amend your personal information by sending a registered letter to the web-publishing company at the address listed below or by sending an e-mail to [support@cafegames.zendesk.com](mailto:support@cafegames.zendesk.com). Please note that this e-mail address is not intended for and will not respond to customer inquiries; rather, customer inquiries should made on our contact page located at [](). Please be aware that this Privacy Policy and the choices you make on this Site will not necessarily apply to Personally Identifiable Information you may have provided to Cafe.com in the context of other, separately operated, Cafe.com products or Services. When contacting Cafe.com to change your information, please make sure to specify whether you would like to change your information for all Cafe.com products and Services, or only the information that you supplied when registering to use this Site.

THE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION. 

Cafe.com protects the security of your payment and financial information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software which encrypts the information you enter. In addition, access to customer data is restricted to Cafe.com employees with permission to access customer data for business and customer support purposes. Your e-mail address may be shared with third party e-mail carriers who assist us in sending e-mails from Cafe.com to our customers. To protect against credit card fraud, Cafe.com does not maintain credit card numbers on its system. Despite these practices, no security measures are completely fail-safe or impervious to circumvention. Your communications with us will travel through third party networks and we assume no responsibility for the security of such networks. Further, we are not responsible for events beyond our control, including without limitation, failure of security measures, the malicious acts or willful misconduct of hackers or any other person.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS. 

Cafe.com abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.

COPPA COMPLIANCE. 

Cafe.com complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"). COPPA protects the personal information of children under the age of 13. This applies to individually identifiable information about a child that is collected online, such as full name, home address, e-mail address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child. COPPA also covers other types of information—for example, hobbies, interests and information collected through cookies or other types of tracking mechanisms—when they are tied to individually identifiable information. It is important for you to understand this law; we encourage you to read more about COPPA.

Note to Parents:  
Cafe.com is committed to providing a safe, secure, and fun online experience for children who visit our Site. We are dedicated to safeguarding any personal information collected online and ensuring that COPPA rules are being followed in conjunction with all other activities conducted on our Site, helping parents and children have a positive experience on the Internet. Children can use the Site and view content without any Personally Identifiable Information being collected. However, in some areas of the Site, it is necessary to collect Personally Identifiable Information from children so that they can participate in an activity or download a videogame. Consistent with COPPA, we do not knowingly request or accept Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. In addition, Cafe.com will not condition a child's participation in an activity on the child providing more information than is reasonably necessary for the activity. A printable consent form is built into the registration process to help us secure parental consent and can also be obtained [here](http://www.cafe.com/BottomLinks/Cafe.com_parental_consent_form_v1.0.pdf). Parents will always have access to all personal information we have about their children. If your child has registered using a false age, please notify us and we will immediately close the account and nullify all Personally Identifiable Information collected from the child. Parents can revoke their consent and ask that information about their children be deleted from the Site by contacting us at [support@cafegames.zendesk.com](mailto:support@cafegames.zendesk.com) explaining that you want to deactivate your child's account. Parents may obtain any Personally Identifiable Information collected from their child by sending an e-mail to [support@cafegames.zendesk.com](mailto:support@cafegames.zendesk.com) requesting the Personally Identifiable Information. Cafe.com will obtain verifiable parental consent for the collection, use or disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information from a child.
