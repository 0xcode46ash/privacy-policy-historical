Analytic and Reporting Technologies.

**When Will CafePress.com Disclose My Information to Third Parties?**

Generally speaking, we do not intentionally disclose your information to third parties without your consent. In some instances, however, we reserve the right to do so because it is necessary to the operation and continued growth of our business or to protect the rights of others. These instances are discussed below: 

Disclosure to Successors.  We may disclose your Personal Information to any successor-in-interest of ours, such as a company that acquires us.

Disclosure to Unaffiliated Third Parties.  We may disclose your Personal Information to prevent an emergency, to protect or enforce our rights, to protect or enforce the rights of a third party, or as required or permitted by law (including, without limitation, to comply with a subpoena or court order). In particular, if you are a Shopkeeper, we may disclose your information to a third party that alleges that you have infringed their intellectual property rights through the products sold through your Shop. Similarly, if you allege that a Shopkeeper allegedly infringes your intellectual property rights, we may disclose your information to that Shopkeeper. 

Disclosure to Third-Party Service Providers.  We may contract with various third parties who help us provide and maintain the Web Site or the CafePress.com Services. For example, we use a third-party to process payments made to us, and may subcontract out manufacturing, fulfillment, or other operations. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such third parties from disclosing your Personal Information, except for the purpose of providing the services in question. However, we cannot guarantee that such third parties will not disclose your Personal Information. 

Disclosure to Shopkeepers.  If you purchase a product from a Shop, CafePress.com may provide your name, mailing address, and email address to the Shopkeeper. In the Shopkeeper Agreement, CafePress.com contractually obligates each Shopkeeper not to use or disclose this information for any purposes other than internal record keeping, to ship their Products, and for marketing their Shops, **only if you have opted in** to receive marketing material directly from the Shopkeeper. However, we cannot guarantee all Shopkeepers will comply with this obligation.

Disclosure of Non-Personal Information.  We will disclose Non-Personal Information, usually in aggregate form, to potential strategic partners, advertisers, investors, customers, and others. You may not "opt out" of the sharing of this information. However, it cannot be easily used to identify you personally.
