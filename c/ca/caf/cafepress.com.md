[Help Desk](https://web.archive.org/web/20011217191127id_/http%3A//www.cafepress.com/cp/info/help/index.aspx) : **Privacy Policy**

Cafe Press values the privacy of our partners and customers. We do not sell any personal information to other companies - we sell T-shirts, not data. In keeping to the highest Web standards, we would like to detail what information we use, and how we use it:

**Server Logs**  
The Web server does log your IP address in standard server logs. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site.

**Cookies**  
If you are a member, and log in to design your merchandise, our site uses cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you change Web pages. We may also use cookies to keep track of which shopping cart belongs to you. We do not belong to any groups that track users across Web sites.

**Contact and Personal Information** \- Revised May 10, 2001  
When you register for a store, we require personal information (like name, email address, and mailing address). We use this information to pay you your commissions.

We reserve the right to share a storeowners contact and personal information with individuals and/or entities for legitimate purposes such as copyright infringement claims brought against a store for the images found in it.

We would use this information only as necessary.

If we do use mailing lists for advertising or promotional purposes, we will always have a clear mechanism for you to remove yourself from future mailings.

We also require information for shipping and billing products. If we do use this information for promotional purposes, we would get explicit permission first. Without explicit permission, we will not use any addresses gathered through our store except for order processing.

**Other Sites**  
This site contains links to other sites. Cafe Press is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

Cafe Press also has "powered by" affiliate programs with other Web sites. We share the same information with our affiliates as we do with any of our normal members. We do not share any additional information gathered from our site. We do not control what information they gather before you arrive at our site.

**Public Forums**  
This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
