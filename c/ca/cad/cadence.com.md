The information we and our service providers may automatically collect includes, but is not limited to, your IP address, your browser type and operating system, the webpages you view on the Sites, clickstream data, the time and length of your visit to the Sites, the search terms you enter on the Sites, your domain name, your email address (to the extent it is automatically recognized by our servers), and information viewed and/or downloaded on the Sites. This information helps us to improve the content of the Sites, and customize the content or layout of the Sites.

##### Security of Your Information

While we strive to maintain reasonable physical, technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard the information that we collect, we cannot ensure the absolute security of your information. We also are not responsible for the security of information you transmit to the Sites over networks that we do not control, including the Internet and wireless networks.  


##### Children’s Privacy

The Sites are not directed to, nor do we knowingly collect information from, anyone under 13 years of age. If you become aware that your child has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us at the contact information listed below.  


##### Location of Your Information

Information covered by this Privacy Policy will be transferred to, stored at, and processed in and subject to the laws of the United States, which may not provide the same level of protection for your personal information as your home country. In addition, we may further transfer your information outside the United States to our affiliates and service providers located in other countries, or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law. By submitting any personal information or by using the Sites and without limitation to any other rights or obligations we have, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the United States and these other countries, and acknowledge that your information may be subject to access by law enforcement and other government entities, including courts and tribunals, in accordance with laws applicable in those jurisdictions.  


##### Your Choices

You have the right to request access to and to correct certain information that Cadence holds about you. Any access request may be subject to a fee, where permitted and in accordance with law, to meet our costs in providing you with the details of the information that we hold about you. Please send any requests for access to [privacy@cadence.com](mailto:privacy@cadence.com). In some countries, you also may have a right to oppose, for legitimate grounds, the processing of your data by the Sites; in those countries, if you exercise that right, understand that you may not be able to use the Sites and this may result in reduced functionality of the Sites. You may exercise your rights to access, update, rectify, and where the rights is provided by local law, oppose the processing of your information by contacting us at [privacy@cadence.com](mailto:privacy@cadence.com).

In some cases, we provide a means to create an account or a profile of information on the Sites. In such cases, you may access and correct certain information by accessing your account or profile.

You may opt-out from receiving promotional or marketing e-mails by notifying us at the address specified at the bottom of any unwanted e-mail. These opt-out procedures may not be available for transactional or relationship messages, such as e-mails that are necessary to provide you with confirmation of a completed transaction (such as a purchase, service request, or change in your user profile), to provide you with warranty information regarding a particular product you purchased, to provide notification of changes of terms of service, or to provide you with important information about the use of a product that you have purchased or software that you have downloaded.

We may send you periodic mailings or telephone you to inform you of new products, services, or events. If you do not wish to receive such calls, you may request to be removed from the call list at the time of the call.

You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You may also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some areas of the Sites may not function properly.
