Privacy Policy

Introduction  
Your privacy is important to Cadence Design Systems, Inc. ("Cadence"). The following privacy policy discloses the information practices for Cadence websites, including the type of information gathered, how the information is used internally and Cadence's policy regarding sharing information with others. 

We have implemented these practices for the Cadence Web Site (www.cadence.com) and we have instructed our web-masters to include information on these privacy practices wherever personal information is collected on a [Cadence website](https://web.archive.org/index.aspx). 

We encourage you to read this privacy policy and those of all the Cadence websites that you visit.

Collection and Use of Personal Information  
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to: a first and last name; email address; a home, postal or other physical address or other contact information; title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, or personal interests; and other information necessary to provide a service that you requested. 

Domain Name  
We make every effort to honor the preferences of our website users concerning the collection and use of our websites. You may visit our websites anonymously. As a general matter, we collect the domain names of our visitors in order to measure use, to improve the content of our sites or to customize the content or layout of the site for the individual consumer. We may also aggregate information relating to our visitors' traffic patterns. 

E-mail Address  
In some cases, we collect the e-mail addresses of our visitors to the extent that those addresses are automatically recognized by our servers. We always collect the e-mail addresses which are volunteered by the consumer through e-mail messages to our company, through messages on bulletin boards, through surveys and site registrations or through our training programs.

We may also use the e-mail lists for marketing purposes and to keep those interested in our products informed about events or other items of interest. Additionally, we may want to notify consumers about recent updates to our websites, to provide product news notification (such as patch releases) to our customers and to confirm registrations, purchases or service request submissions. Our customers also may receive e-mail messages to confirm fulfillment of an order.

You may opt-out from receiving the above promotional or marketing e-mails by notifying us at the address specified at the bottom of any unwanted e-mail. These opt-out procedures may not be available for e-mails which are necessary to provide confirmation of a completed transaction (such as a purchase, service request or change in the consumer's user profile).

Other Personal Information  
We may use a mailing address or phone number that a customer provides for a variety of Cadence-related reasons. We may send periodic mailings to customers or telephone them to inform them of new products, services or events. If you do not wish to receive such calls, you may request to be removed from the call list at the time of the call.

Your mailing address and telephone number may also be used to contact you about orders placed on-line, as a reminder about events for which you have registered, or to provide information which you have requested.

Personal Information is Not Released to Outside Parties  
Any information that you provide to us will be used for our purposes only. Your information will not be shared with individuals or other companies (such as direct mail organizations) unless required by law. However, we may need to provide your name and delivery address to third parties that we use for delivering specific services to you (such as support services or shipping).

Cookies  
Some of our sites use cookies to allow us to understand what areas of our Website are of interest to you so we can better serve you and provide you with tailored information upon your visit. A cookie is an element of data that a Website can send to your browser that may be stored on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some areas of some sites may not function properly.

Data Security  
Your Cadence account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. We safeguard the security of the data you send us with certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. In most areas, we use industry-standard-encryption to enhance the security of data transmissions. In other areas, we notify you with a pop-up screen when we transfer or receive certain types of sensitive information. There are also appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to prevent loss or unauthorized use of sensitive information.

While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. We suggest that you change your passwords often, that your passwords include a combination of letters and numbers, and that you are using a secure browser. Products and services are available which can help give you privacy protection while navigating the Web. See <http://www.privacyalliance.org/resources/> for an overview of many privacy-related tools.

Children's Privacy  
We do not structure our websites to attract children. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect personal information from anyone under 13 years of age.

Oversight and Questions  
We welcome comments and questions on this policy. As stated above, we are dedicated to protecting your privacy and we will make every reasonable effort to keep your information secure. Due to the rapidly evolving changes on the Internet, we may update this policy. All revisions will be posted to this site. Questions regarding our policy should be directed to the [Contact us form](https://web.archive.org/contact_us/contactus.aspx).
