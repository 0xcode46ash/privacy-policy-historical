### Privacy / Security

Cadence places the highest priority on the privacy and confidentiality of our customers and their financial relationship with our bank. Because of our commitment to providing the highest levels of security and privacy of our customers' personal financial information, Cadence has adopted the following privacy policy in order to continue in our total commitment to provide quality service to our customers.

Protecting Your Privacy Is Our Top Priority  
Protecting your privacy is very important to Cadence Financial Corporation and our employees. We value the trust and confidence you have placed with us and want you to understand what information we collect and how we use it. It is our goal to provide our customers with a broad range of financial and insurance products and services as effectively and conveniently as possible. In order to do this, we use technology to manage and maintain customer information. Our Privacy Policy serves as a standard for all our employees for collection, use, retention, and security of nonpublic personal information.

Our Security Procedures  
We take a variety of steps to safeguard customer information. We restrict access to your personal and account information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. In addition, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.

What Information We Collect  
We may collect "nonpublic personal information" about you from the following sources:

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other loan and account forms;
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others; and 
  * Information we receive from third parties such as credit reporting agencies. 



"Non-public personal information" is nonpublic information about you that we obtain in connection with providing a financial product or service to you. For example, nonpublic personal information includes information regarding your account balance, payment history, and overdraft history.

What Information We Disclose  
We are permitted under law to share information about our experiences or transactions with you or your account (such as your account balance and your payment history with us) with companies related to us by common control or ownership ("affiliates").

We also are permitted under law to disclose nonpublic personal information about you to "nonaffiliated third parties" (i.e., third parties that are not members of our corporate family) in certain circumstances. For example, we may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to such third parties to assist us in servicing your loan or account with us; to government entities in response to subpoenas; and to credit reporting agencies. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you to any other third parties, except as permitted by law.

We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements.

If you decide to close your account(s) or become an inactive customer, we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice.

### Security

This Internet Banking System brings together a combination of industry-approved security technologies to protect data for the bank and for you, our customer. It features password-controlled system entry, a VeriSign-issued Digital ID for the bank's server, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol for data encryption, and a routerÂ with a firewall to regulate the inflow and outflow of server traffic.

Secure Access and Verifying User Authenticity  
To begin a session with the bank's server the user must key in a Log-in ID and a password. Our system, the Internet Banking System, uses a "3 strikes and you're out" lock-out mechanism to deter users from repeated login attempts. After three unsuccessful login attempts, the system locks the user out, requiring either a designated wait period or a phone call to the bank to verify the password before re-entry into the system. Upon successful login, the Digital ID from VeriSign, the experts in digital identification certificates, authenticates the user's identity and establishes a secure session with that visitor.

Secure Data Transfer  
Once the server session is established, the user and the server are in a secured environment. Because the server has been certified as a 128-bit secure server by VeriSign, data traveling between the user and the server is encrypted with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. With SSL, data that travels between the bank and customer is encrypted and can only be decrypted with the public and private key pair. In short, the bank's server issues a public key to the end user's browser and creates a temporary private key. These two keys are the only combination possible for that session. When the session is complete, the keys expire and the whole process starts over when a new end user makes a server session.

Router and Firewall  
Requests must filter through a router and firewall before they are permitted to reach the server. A router, a piece of hardware, works in conjunction with the firewall, a piece of software, to block and direct traffic coming to the server. The configuration begins by disallowing ALL traffic and then opens holes only when necessary to process acceptable data requests, such as retrieving web pages or sending customer requests to the bank. Using the above technologies, your Internet banking transactions are secure.
