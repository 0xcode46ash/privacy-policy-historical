# Catalog Choice - Eliminate unwanted catalogs you receive in the mail

Catalog Choice does not sell, rent, exchange or otherwise disclose our mailing lists or information about our site visitors. Catalog Choice captures information about visits to our site, but we use this information to analyze general traffic patterns (e.g. what pages are most/least popular) and to perform routine system maintenance. 

Your personally identifiable information will only be used to remove you from specific catalog mailing lists. Catalog Choice’s website asks for specific information about you so that mail preference forms can be generated for you. This information will never be released without your explicit permission. We are designed to help you reduce unwanted catalogs.
