When you register with CSI or participate in a contest or promotion online through this Site you may choose to receive e-mails or postal mail from us regarding our company, corporate information, products, services, contests and promotions. From time to time, we may also send you e-mails to help us learn more about your online preferences. To find out how to remove yourself from our mailing list, [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20060617104641id_/http%3A//catherines.charmingshoppes.com/custsvc/Catherines/faq.asp#maillist).

how do we disclose or share information with unrelated third parties?

Unless you have opted out of the disclosure of sharing of information with third parties as set forth below, we may share information with unrelated third parties for a variety of reasons. For example, we may contract with unrelated third parties to assist us in maintaining and managing our customer and investor information, to fulfill orders and promotions, and to communicate with our customers and investors. We do not authorize any of those third parties to make any other use of your information. In addition, when we team up with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions, we and the other company may share our customer databases to identify common customers. We and the other company may also use that existing information to identify future promotional opportunities for you and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations arising from such promotions. We also may share your information with our other business partners. When we offer contests and promotions, or join with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information to participate. In addition to the sharing of such information with the other company as set forth above, that information may then be used by us and any company offering the contest or promotion to notify winners or to fulfill promotional and/or contractual obligations. If prior to participating in a contest or promotion you opted not to receive information from us, you may still receive information from or about CSI (and/or such other company participating in the contest or promotion) in connection with the specific contest or promotion if you choose to participate in it. You may opt not to participate in these contests or promotions if you do not want to receive information about CSI or share your information with us and the other companies sponsoring those contests or promotions. 

In the event that CSI’s, our parent’s or any of our affiliates’ or subsidiaries’ businesses or assets are sold, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 

We may share customer information with law enforcement agencies in the event of a criminal investigation or suspected illegal activity with or without requiring a court order or a subpoena. 

Finally, if we believe that an unrelated third party’s products or services may be of interest to you, we may share your personal information with or disclose such personal information to such outside company so that they can market their products or services directly to you. 

You may opt out of the sharing of information with unrelated third parties as provided below in the Section titled “How Do I Update My Personal Information or Opt Out of Third-Party Disclosure?”
