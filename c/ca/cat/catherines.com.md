**How Do We Use Your Information?**

Catherines collects information from you in an effort to fulfill your requests, and to communicate with you about our company and products. When you register with Catherines or participate in a contest or promotion online through this Site you may choose to receive e-mails from us regarding our company, our corporate information, services, contests, and promotions. From time to time, we may also send you e-mails to help us learn more about your online preferences. In addition, we may use information about your product interests and purchases to help us improve our Site design and your online experience.

We may combine information you provide with demographic information that is publicly available. We use this combined information to enhance and personalize your online experience with us, and to communicate with you by e-mail or otherwise about our company, products, services, contests, and promotions that may be of interest to you. We also may share your information with our affiliates and subsidiaries. In addition, we may share your information with unrelated third parties as set forth below in the Section titled **“How Do We Share Information With Unrelated Third Parties?”**.

**How Do We Protect Your Information?**

Because we are not collecting specific credit card data, the information collected is transmitted over an insecure server. Nevertheless, Catherines uses industry standard efforts, such as firewalls, to safeguard the confidentiality of your information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to reasonably safeguard and secure the information we collect online. If in the future we do collect sensitive data through this web site, Catherines will encrypt your personal information before it travels over the Internet using industry standards for secure online transactions.

**How Do We Share Information With Unrelated Third Parties?**

We may share information with unrelated third parties for a variety of reasons. For example, we may contract with unrelated third parties to assist us in maintaining and managing our customer information, to fulfill promotions, and to communicate with our customers. We do not authorize any of those third parties to make any other use of your information. In addition, when we team up with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions, we and the other company may share our customer databases to identify common customers. We and the other company may also use that existing information to identify future promotional opportunities for you and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations arising from such promotions. We also may share your information with our other business partners.

When we offer contests and promotions, or join with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information to participate. That information may then be used by us and any company offering the contest or promotion to notify winners or to fulfill promotional and/or contractual obligations. If prior to participating in a contest or promotion you opted not to receive information from us, you may still receive information from or about Catherines in connection with the specific contest or promotion if you choose to participate in it. You may opt not to participate in these contests or promotions if you do not want to receive information about Catherines or share your information with us and the other companies sponsoring those contests or promotions.

In the event that Catherines’ or any of our subsidiaries’ businesses or assets are sold, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

Finally, if we believe that an unrelated third party’s products or services may be of interest to you, we may share your personal information with or disclose such personal information to such outside company so that they can market their products or services directly to you. 

You may opt out of the sharing of information with unrelated third parties as provided below in the Section titled **“How Do I Change Or Delete My Personal Information Or Opt Out of Disclosure?”**.

**How Do I Change Or Delete My Personal Information Or Opt Out Of Disclosure?**

If at any time you would like us to update your personal information or remove you from our e-mail or postal mailing lists, feel free to contact us by either using the process set forth above or by writing to us at Catherines, Inc., 3742 Lamar Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee, 38118.
