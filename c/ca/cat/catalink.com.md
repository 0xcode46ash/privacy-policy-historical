**The Information Catalink Stores**  
Catalink stores the following information about its members:

  * Your Ip address
  * Time of your visit
  * Pages Visited
  * Registration information
  * Any other information submitted via our forms or by direct contact



This information is used to maximise the efficiency of the catalogue and brochure requesting to ensure that the duration of your visit to Catalink can be spent gathering information rather than giving it. In addition we use the information you have provided to keep you informed of new events, products and other topical items of interest from our portal activities.

Associated catalogue companies and related consumer affiliates are also eager to network with members to inform them of some of the benefits their organisations have to offer the increasingly satellite-based individuals they seek to service. As the twenty-first century progresses there is no doubt information exchange through remote networking is increasingly important with the internet providing the focal point of contact for us all. Any third parties who seek to network with our members are carefully veted by our administration team to ensure that only items which may be of particular interest to consumers are authorised. 

If you are a member of Catalink and specifically do not wish to receive such information you may advise us at any time by logging into your account and then clicking on your account profile page, where you will be given full instructions.

To ensure that the merchants represented on Catalink are able to provide you, their prospective customer, with the most desirable products and most efficient service, we follow up all requests with a short and simple feedback form to provide information on your level of satisfaction and also to identify areas which may need improvement. As a member you are automatically sent this feedback email 14 days after you first place your catalogue or brochure request.

**Your Membership**  
Your membership of the Catalink Network is highly valued not only as you represent a potential customer for our merchants who seek to serve you but also because of your valid opinions as a consumer. We hope you enjoy the Catalink experience and find useful catalogues and brochures for yourself and your family.

We would most respectively urge you to be discriminate when selecting catalogues and request only those of genuine interest. Catalogues although most willingly distributed to you free of charge, are expensive to produce and deliver. If you are in doubt as to the suitability of any catalogue or brochure Catalink provides a quick link directly through to the relative website. 

We are constantly updating Catalink with new and innovative catalogues and brochures, so please visit us regularly. We constantly aim to improve the features of Catalink and if you have any comments or suggestions to make, please complete our [contact us form](http://www.catalink.com/contact_us.php).
