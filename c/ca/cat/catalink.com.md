This information is used to maximise the efficiency of the catalogue requesting and product ordering process to ensure that the duration of your visit to the Catalink Network can be spent gathering information rather than giving it. In addition we use the information you have provided to keep you informed of new events, products and other topical items of interest from our portal activities.

If you are a member of Catalink and specifically do not wish to receive such information you may advise us now by logging into your account and returning to this page, where you will be given full instructions. Also, if at any time in the future you do not wish to receive this information, you will be given the option on each communication to advise us accordingly. 

Associated catalogue companies and related consumer affiliates are also eager to network with members to inform them of some of the benefits their organisations have to offer the increasingly satellite-based individuals they seek to service. As the twenty-first century progresses there is no doubt information exchange through remote networking is increasingly important with the internet providing the focal point of contact for us all. Any third parties who seek to network with our members are carefully veted by our administration team to ensure that only items which may be of particular interest to consumers are authorised.

To ensure that catalogue merchants represented on the Catalink Network are able to provide you, their prospective customer, with the most desirable products and most efficient service, we are often asked to conduct short surveys to provide not only this information but also to identify areas which may be lacking. As a member of the Catalink Network we may call upon you to seek your opinion of a particular catalogue, product range or other related information. All surveys are brief and simple and take no more than a few moments to complete.

**Your Membership:**  
Your membership of the Catalink Network is highly valued not only as you represent a potential customer for our catalogue merchants who seek to serve you but also because of your valid opinions as a consumer. We hope you enjoy the Catalink experience and find useful catalogues for yourself and your family. 

We would most respectively urge you to be discriminate when selecting catalogues and request only those of genuine interest. Catalogues although most willingly distributed to you free of charge, are expensive to produce and deliver. If you are in doubt as to the suitability of any catalogue the Catalink Network provides a quick link directly through to the relative website. By staying within the Catalink window, you can easily resume your catalogue search within the Catalink portal again. 

We are constantly updating the Catalink portal with new and innovative catalogues, so please visit us regularly. We constantly aim to improve the features of the Catalink Network and if you have any comments or suggestions to make, please contact us at [members@catalink.net](mailto:members@catalink.net). 

**Security**
