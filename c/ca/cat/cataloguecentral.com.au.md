Again, this would only ever relate to your designated preferences.

If you send an e-mail message that includes personally identifiable information, for example, in an e-mail message containing an inquiry, we will use that information to respond to your inquiry. Remember that e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. 

It is our policy to not sell, rent, or give away any nonpublic personal information unless required by law.
