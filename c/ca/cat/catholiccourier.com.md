# Privacy Policy - Catholic Courier

  
The _Catholic Courier_ is committed to safeguarding your personally identifiable information.

###### A. Types of Information We Collect.

  1. **Personally Identifiable Information:** "Personally identifiable information" may include your name, age bracket, gender, e-mail address, zip code, phone number and other information by which you can be personally identified. Many users of CatholicCouirer.com will never be asked to provide personally identifiable information. However, at times you may be required to provide personally identifiable information in order to participate in or acquire specific types of services available at the Web site. For example, we may need to gather your personally identifiable information to permit you to access certain features of the site, such as the the Diocesan Directory, or if you elect to fill out forms on the site to submit news/calendar items or letters to the editor, comment on our coverage, suggest stories, order copies of our print publications, change your address or request information from our staff. At times we may passively collect information from our Web site users such as e-mail addresses, Internet Service Provider address, access time and date, and click streams. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
  2. **Web Site Usage Information:** Our Web servers automatically collect Web Site Usage information from you when you visit our Web Site, including browser type, IP Address, and time of visit. Web Site Usage information describes how our Web site is used and navigated, including the number and frequency of visitors to each Web page, and the length of their stays. However, since it does not permit us to specifically identify you, it does not constitute "personally identifiable information."
  3. **Cookies:** Like most Web sites, CatholicCourier.com makes use of browser "cookies." Cookies are files written to a user's hard disk and read by our server or other computer programs. They allow our servers to determine how recently a browser has visited our site, and to retain some information about actions and selections on our site. We may use this technology in order to provide a more personal experience at our Web site. If you do not want to have cookies written to your hard drive, your Web browser software should contain a feature that allows you to accept or decline them. However, if you opt to decline our cookies, we cannot guarantee we will be able to provide the same user experience we would if you were to accept them or that you will be able to use or participate in all of our services.



###### B. How We Use Information We Collect.

We will not share personally identifiable information about you with third parties without your consent except as necessary to provide you with services or information that you specifically request. We may also use your personally identifiable information to invite you to subscribe to e-mail newsletters from us. If you receive such an invitation and decline to subscribe, we will not send the newsletters to you. In addition, we will share personally identifiable information with governmental authorities, will respond to subpoenas when legally required or authorized to do so, and will disclose information we collect about you under other circumstances as required by law. We may compile information about you and other users of our Web site in a way that does not permit anyone reviewing the information to personally identify you ("aggregate information"). We may provide this non-personally identifiable, aggregate information to third parties for market analysis and other purposes.

###### Â C. Security.

We use commercially reasonable efforts to keep your information secure. Access to servers that contain personal information is limited to those Catholic Courier employees and representatives who have a need to know such personal information in order to perform their customary duties. We maintain safeguards for the integrity of our Web site. However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personally identifiable information that you transmit to us. You transmit information at your own risk.

###### D. Links to Other Web Sites.

From time to time, we may make content from other Web sites available from links located on our Web site. Each content Web site to which our Web site links will have its own individual privacy policy that you should consult to determine how that Web site protects its visitors' privacy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those other sites.

###### E. Policy Modification.

We may change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the change on our Web site. We will note on the Web site the date on which this Policy was last changed. Please be assured that, if our Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personally identifiable information we previously gathered in a manner that is inconsistent with the Privacy Policy as in effect when we obtained that information.

###### F. Your consent.

Your use of CatholicCourier.com constitutes acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy in the form published on the Web site at the time of use and further constitutes your consent to the collection and use of this information by the _Catholic Courier_ in accordance with this policy.
