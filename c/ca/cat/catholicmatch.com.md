# Privacy Policy

###### **Last Updated On:** July 24th, 2013

The CatholicMatch Privacy Policy covers how CatholicMatch treats personal information that is obtained from its users. Personal information is defined as that which personally identifies you. Examples included, but are not limited to, your name, address, e-mail address, phone number and other information not readily available to the general public. This policy applies strictly to CatholicMatch and not to any other associated firm or person whom CatholicMatch does not control.

**1\. Information Collected By CatholicMatch**

CatholicMatch gathers two types of information: that which users submit to us and that which is not directly submitted by users

**2\. Information Submitted To CatholicMatch**

There are two types of user-submitted information we collect: Public & Private. We define Public information as personal information that may be displayed on the site, such as gender, age and height, but cannot be linked to a particular user. Private information is defined as any information that allows others to contact a user other than through CatholicMatch or allows the collection of information about the user other then what is displayed on the site.

a) Public: To accomplish our goal of bringing Catholic people together, we must gather personal information. This includes, but is not limited to: customer-specified CatholicMatch' username, gender, age, birth date, first name, ethnic background, appearance, religion, occupation, information and general geographic location. Some of this information is optional, and meant to be seen by members and visitors to the site, but cannot be used to identify a specific member by name, address, etc.

b) Private: This information is gathered from members and guests who apply for the various services our site offers. This information includes, but is not limited to: e-mail address, last name, credit card number for payment, a user-specified CatholicMatch password, mailing address, zip code and telephone number.

**3\. Information Not Directly Submitted to CatholicMatch**

a) Aggregate: This is information we collect that is not personally identifiable, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all users to the site.

**4\. Sharing of the Information this Website Gathers**

Except where you are expressly informed otherwise or as described immediately below, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information except to the financial institution that processes your credit card, unless required by law or for the protection of your membership.

If you register with CatholicMatch through one of our co-branded versions, your registration and profile information may be shared with the co-branding partner solely for the purpose of fulfilling the services provided by the co-branding site and any related promotional offers. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of the co-branded partner for questions about their use of your personally identifiable information and how you can modify or delete it.

In the event CatholicMatch is acquired or merged by another company, this privacy policy would lapse and be superseded by the policy of the new ownership. In the event of such a transaction, you are to be notified at the e-mail address registered with CatholicMatch.

**5\. Targeted Advertisements**

CatholicMatch may deliver targeted advertising based on personal information, however CatholicMatch does not provide personal information to the advertiser. By interacting with the vendor, however, the advertiser may assume you meet the targeting criteria and send you future advertisements based on this.

**6\. CatholicMatch Affiliate Partners**

Information submitted by the Partner is used for establishing and maintaining a business relationship. No personal or business information is shared outside the relationship between CatholicMatch and the Partner. Partners may not view or access private information on CatholicMatch' subscribers.

**7\. Use of Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. If a user does not enable cookies to be set on their browser, they will not be able to use our website. We occasionally use cookies to anonymously track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site to allow enhanced capabilities, such as chat. We do not and will not, use cookies to collect private information from any user.

Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to, or control over these cookies. We may also use a third-party advertising company to serve ads externally to the site on the behalf of CatholicMatch and our partners.

**8\. Editing & Deleting Your Account Information**

You can edit your CatholicMatch account information at any time. We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the CatholicMatch service, without allowing you to opt out of them. You can remove your CatholicMatch account by visiting our [unsubscribe page](https://web.archive.org/help/remove_account.html).

**9\. Changes To The Privacy Policy**

If we change our privacy policy, we will notify our members in some form. Our members are always made aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point, we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner, and we will then use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
