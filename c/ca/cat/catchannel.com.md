**Animal Network Privacy Policy**

This policy covers all sites produced by Animal Network, a division of Fancy Publications Inc. This policy does not cover information collected on sites linked from Animal Network sites.

Animal Network sites are committed to bringing you information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, to protecting your privacy. The following is a summary of the various ways we gather and disseminate the information you provide us while using our sites. We use the information we collect on the site to enhance your overall experience. Information on visitors collected on Animal Network's sites is used exclusively by the parent company, Fancy Publications Inc., and is not otherwise distributed, revealed, sold or used for any other purpose.

Animal Network only collects personally identifying information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you register for our services, enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey or subscribe to our magazines, you are asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name, or phone number. Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested.

Animal Network uses this information to provide you with the service you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to one of our magazines, we will use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your address to send you your magazine. Similarly, if you enter online contests, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. We may also use this information to send you regular e-mail newsletters, inform you about new features, products or services, or other changes to the services.

While your individual information is protected as outlined above, we reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a LoginID more than once, such as when entering one of our pet communities, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Links**

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Animal Network and its parent company, Fancy Publications Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Animal Network sites.

**Child Protection**

No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information or use our public discussion areas, forums, and chats. Minors under the age of 18 are prohibited from making purchases, including subscriptions, on our sites.

If your children disclose information about themselves in our public discussion areas, they may get unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, you should tell them not to do so.

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
