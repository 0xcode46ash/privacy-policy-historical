If you apply for a job at H101, you provide your email address, educational and employment background, and job interest data. You may chose to submit your name when registering or remain anonymous. H101 will not use personal data submitted as part of the job application process for any other purpose. 

**How we use it**

H101 uses your information to help us understand your needs and interests and provide you with better services. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction or order, to communicate with you, to provide service and support, to update you on services and benefits, to personalize promotional offers and to personalize some hospitality101.com web sites. Occasionally we may also use your information to contact you for market research regarding H101 products or services. We will give you the opportunity to opt-out of market research and customer surveys. Credit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention, and is not used for other purposes.

Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide through other sources such as product registration, call centers or public events such as trade shows or seminars. 

Anonymous (non-personal) data is aggregated for reporting about hospitality101.com web site usability, performance, and effectiveness. It is used to improve the customer experience, usability and site content. 

**Who we share it with**

H101 will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others. H101 will not share your personal information with a business partner or any unrelated third party company unless you give your permission. Your permission will be requested when you submit your information. H101 shares customer information across H101 business entities and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, within the usage limits described above in "How we use it". 

  
H101 contracts with third party service providers and suppliers to provide complete products, services and customer solutions described in "How we use it". These suppliers and service providers act on H101's behalf and are bound to the H101 Privacy Policy contractually through H101 confidentiality and personal data protection agreements. Suppliers and service providers are required to keep confidential the information received on behalf of H101 and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for H101. These service providers may change or we may contract with additional service providers in order to provide new services. H101 will not share personal information with any other third parties without your permission unless required by law enforcement action or subpoena.

**Choice **

You can subscribe to receive some product- and service-specific information and H101-wide marketing communications. H101-wide communications may include new product information, special offers or possibly an invitation to participate in market research. We give you a choice regarding H101-wide communications by postal mail, email and telephone. H101's online registration tool makes it easy to create or edit your privacy preferences. This option does not apply to communications for the purpose of administering order completion, contracts, support or driver updates. 

H101 will not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information to unrelated third party companies. Some H101 services are linked with those from other unrelated third party companies, some which offer you the option to share personal data you give with both H101 and the third party. Examples include the ability to register software products from multiple vendors from a single H101 web page, request communications from H101 marketing or solution partners or enable order completion through a reseller. We will not share your personal information with those third party companies unless you make that choice. Local country laws and policies are applied where they differ from those in the U.S.

Links provided on hospitality101.com to third party web sites are provided as a convenience and H101 does not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from ours. H101 does not endorse or make any representations about them. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information. The personal data you choose to give to unrelated third parties is covered by their privacy policies, not the H101 Privacy Policy. Some third-party companies may choose to share their personal data with H101; that sharing is governed by that third-party company's privacy policy. 

**Onward Transfer**

Personal data given to H101 may be transferred across state and country borders for the purposes of data consolidation, storage and simplified customer information management. The practices which govern this data movement are described in our commitments in the Choice and Security sections of this privacy statement. 

**Access & Accuracy **

H101 strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate. We have put in place managerial data standards review processes and technological tools to maintain customer data accuracy. We will provide you with access to view and change your information, including making every effort to provide you with online access. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as a password and user ID, before granting access to your data. Certain areas of H101's web sites may limit access to specific individuals through the use of passwords and other personal identifiers.

The most effective way to view and change your personal information is to return to the web page where you originally submitted your data and follow the instructions on that web page or send us an email message. Data access is also available upon request. 

  
**Security**

H101 is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of the information, H101 has in place appropriate physical, managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. 

We use SSL encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information. Credit card numbers are only used for processing payment and are not used for other purposes. Our efforts to protect credit card fraud help protect your financial data security. As part of real-time payment processing, H101 subscribes to a fraud management service. This service gives you and H101 an extra level of protection to guard against credit card fraud.
