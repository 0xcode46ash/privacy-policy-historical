 **Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of information about the user that a website can send to your web browser, which may then store it on your computer system. With the use of cookies, we can better serve you when you return to our site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in future.

 **Log Files**  
We may collect information regarding your IP address, browser type, domain name and access time. This information is used for our own research purposes and is separate from the Data. We do not link IP addresses to any personal information. In rare instances, IP addresses may be used to assist in deterring and/or preventing abusive or criminal activity on the website.  
  
 **Our Commitment to Data Security**  
   | To maintain the accuracy of the Data, as well as preventing from unauthorised access and ensuring the correct use of the Data, we have carried out appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure the Data we collect online.

We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol - an industry standard for encryption over the Internet, to protect the Data. When you type in sensitive information such as credit card details, it will be automatically converted into codes before being securely dispatched over the Internet.

The Data you provide us will be stored in a database for the length of your membership or registration validity, whichever is longer, after which they will be destroyed. The website has a firewall in place, which should protect the Data collected from you against unauthorised or accidental access. However, complete confidentiality and security is not yet possible over the Internet, and privacy cannot be assured in your communications to us. You acknowledge that personal information is disclosed at your own risk, and may be subject to unauthorised use by others. This may result in you receiving unsolicited messages from other parties. We are not responsibile in any manner for direct, indirect, special or consequential damages, howsoever caused arising out of the communication of information to us.
