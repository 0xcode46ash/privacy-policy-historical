Catchpoint Systems, Inc. (“Catchpoint”) provides web performance monitoring services that are used by our customers to measure, analyze and improve the speed, availability and reliability of their websites, web apps and web services (“Catchpoint Services”).

This Privacy Notice does not describe the activities of our customers’ websites, web apps or web services.

Catchpoint has prepared this Privacy Notice to describe our practices regarding the information we collect from: (i) visitors to our website located at www.catchpoint.com (the “Corporate Website”); (ii) individual users, typically representatives of Catchpoint’s customers, authorized to log into the Catchpoint Services user interface (“Platform Interface”); and (iii) visitors to our customers’ websites, web apps and web services on which the Catchpoint Services are deployed.

 **Information about visitors collected by the Corporate Website and Platform Interface  
**  
Our Corporate Website provides information about Catchpoint and the Catchpoint Services. The Corporate Website is also the portal used by Catchpoint Services customers to log into the Platform Interface.

The following information is collected about a visitor to the Corporate Website:

  * The Personally-Identifiable Information that is voluntarily submitted by a visitor, in connection with, for example, a request for more information about Catchpoint Services or for a free trial;
  * The information that is automatically provided by the visitor’s computer browser (“Browser Information”), such as the computer operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (from which we can infer a visitor’s location), time and day of access, browser type and language, and the website the consumer visited before visiting the Corporate Website;
  * The username and password that is entered by an authorized individual user (“Catchpoint Services User”) to gain access to the Platform Interface; and
  * The name, email address, and company affiliation (i.e., the Personally-Identifiable Information) of each Catchpoint Services User logged into the Platform Interface.



 **How information about visitors is collected by the Corporate Website and Platform Interface  
**  
The Corporate Website and Platform Interface use cookies and similar technologies, such as embedded scripts and web beacons (also known as tags or pixels), to collect the information described above.

 _Cookies_ are used to respond, by way of example, to a visitor’s request for more information about the Catchpoint Services or for a free trial. Cookies also authenticate the username and password of a Catchpoint Services User. Some cookies are set by the Corporate Website and the Platform Interface to permit our service providers to perform services on our behalf.

 _Embedded_ scripts are used to measure the pages and features of the Corporate Website used by visitors. Embedded scripts are also used by Catchpoint’s service provider to collect the name, email address and company affiliation of Catchpoint Services Users.

 _Web beacons_ (or tags or pixels) are used to transfer information between a visitor’s browser and the computers of Catchpoint’s service providers in order to power some features of the Corporate Website (for example, to automate requests for further information, and to enable web analytics) on Catchpoint’s behalf.

 **How Catchpoint uses the information it collects from the Corporate Website and Platform Interface  
**  
Catchpoint uses the information collected from the Corporate Website for its business purposes. Depending on the context, Catchpoint can use the information collected to respond to a visitor’s request, to communicate with visitors about Catchpoint and the Catchpoint Services, or to otherwise operate, manage, and improve Catchpoint, the Corporate Website, and the Catchpoint Services.

Catchpoint uses the information collected from the Platform Interface to provide the Catchpoint Services to its customers. For example, the information is used to allow Catchpoint Services Users to log into the Platform Interface, to provide support, training and other services related to the Catchpoint Services, to optimize the user experience on the Platform Interface, to understand how a Catchpoint Services User interacts with the pages and features of the Platform Interface, and otherwise to operate, manage, and improve Catchpoint, the Platform Interface, and the Catchpoint Services.

Catchpoint does not sell, rent or lease the Personally Identifiable Information that it collects on the Corporate Website and Platform Interface to third parties. The Personally Identifiable Information collected from the Corporate Website and Platform Interface may be shared with Catchpoint’s affiliates, and with the service providers that work on Catchpoint’s behalf. Such information may also be disclosed by Catchpoint as required by law, valid court order, or other request from a governmental authority.

 **Information collected by the Catchpoint Services about consumers**

The Catchpoint Services measure the performance of our customers’ websites, web apps and web services (each, a “Web Property”) by testing speed, reliability and availability. The Catchpoint Services run tests that model a consumer’s experience on a customer’s Web Property using equipment located worldwide that is managed by Catchpoint Systems. In addition, the Catchpoint Service known as “Glimpse” (the “Glimpse Service”) is used by Catchpoint’s customers to measure a consumer’s actual experience of a Web Property. The Glimpse Service measures how fast a web page and its components load on a consumer’s browser to provide web developers with information to improve speed and reliability, and to detect and fix errors. With the exception of the Glimpse Service, the Catchpoint Services do not measure or collect information about actual consumer visits.

In connection with providing the Glimpse Service to a customer, Catchpoint collects the following information about a consumer from a customer’s Web Property:

  * Browser Information; and
  * Information about a consumer’s usage of the Web Property that our customer asks Catchpoint to collect, which can include, for example, factors such as the number of visits, the number of page views per visit, whether the visit results in a purchase or other transaction, and whether the Web Property produced any errors during the visit.



 **  
How the Catchpoint Services collect information about consumers**

Catchpoint Services use cookies and similar technologies, such as embedded scripts and web beacons (also known as tags or pixels), to collect the information described above. Cookies are used to associate a consumer’s web browser with the information our customers specify. Embedded scripts are used to measure how a consumer uses a Web Property. Web beacons are used to transfer information between the cookies and Catchpoint computers.

In addition, Catchpoint Services is authorized by its customers to set a Catchpoint cookie on our customers’ Web Properties in connection with providing the Glimpse Service. These cookies are used by the Glimpse Service to recognize a returning visitor, and to determine the number of unique visitors to a Web Property.

 **  
How Catchpoint uses the consumer information collected by the Catchpoint Services**

The information collected by the Catchpoint Services on our customer’s behalf is owned by that customer, and our ability to use that information is limited by Catchpoint’s contract with our customer. Catchpoint is permitted to use that information to provide reporting and analysis services for our customer’s benefit. Catchpoint is also permitted to share “aggregated” information collected from many companies with our customers, prospective customers, and partners in order to improve our products and services, to provide reports and market research, and to understand market trends. Aggregated information does not identify individuals or our customers or website URLs. This aggregated information may be transferred to a successor in interest to Catchpoint, such as a company that acquires Catchpoint or the Catchpoint Services. Catchpoint is also permitted to disclose information as required by law, valid court order, or other request from a governmental authority.

 **  
How Catchpoint’s customers use the information collected by Catchpoint**

Our customers use the reports, analytics and metrics compiled by the Catchpoint Services to operate, identify issues on, improve and optimize their Web Properties. The Catchpoint Services help our customers to provide a better user experience to the people who use their Web Properties. To learn more about how a particular company or Web Property uses the information that Catchpoint collects on its behalf, please consult the privacy notice for that Web Property or company.

Some of the Catchpoint Services use cookies to help collect the information described above. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to block all cookies or to block just those set by companies other than the one whose website you are visiting (often called “Third-Party Cookies”). Please consult the instructions specific to your browser to change your cookie settings.

Your options with respect to a Web Property’s cookies (“First-Party Cookies”) are explained in that Web Property’s or company’s privacy policy. Please consult the privacy policy for that Web Property or company for more information.

Catchpoint employs robust security measures to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of information collected by the Corporate Website and Catchpoint Services. Of course, data transmission over the Internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the Internet.

Catchpoint may update this Privacy Notice to reflect changes to our practices. If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post those changes to this Privacy Notice. We will post any Privacy Notice changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice.
