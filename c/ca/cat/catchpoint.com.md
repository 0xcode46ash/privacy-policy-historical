## Corporate Website

### Information collected by the Corporate Website about visitors

Our Corporate Website provides information about Catchpoint and the Catchpoint Services. It is also the portal used by our customers to log into the Catchpoint Services user interface.  
The Corporate Website collects the following information about a visitor:

  * The Personally-Identifiable Information that is voluntarily submitted by a visitor, in connection with, for example, a request for more information about Catchpoint Services or for a free trial;
  * The username and password that is entered by a Catchpoint customer to log into the Catchpoint Services user interface; and
  * The information that is automatically provided by the visitor’s computer browser (“Browser Information”), such as the computer operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (from which we can infer a visitor’s location), time and day of access, browser type and language, and the website the consumer visited before visiting the Web Property.



### How the Corporate Website collects information about visitors

The Corporate Website uses cookies and similar technologies, such as embedded scripts and web beacons (also known as tags or pixels), to collect the information described above. Cookies are used to authenticate a Catchpoint customer’s username and password when logging into the Catchpoint Services user interface, and to respond, by way of example, to a visitor’s request for more information or for a free trial. Some of these are set by the Corporate Website to permit our service providers to perform services on the Corporate Website on our behalf. Embedded scripts are used to measure how a consumer uses a Web Property. Web beacons are used to transfer information between a visitor’s browser and the computers of Catchpoint’s service providers in order to power some features of the Corporate Website (for example, to automate requests for further information, and to enable web analytics) on Catchpoint’s behalf.

### How Catchpoint uses the information it collects from the Corporate Website

Catchpoint uses the information it collects from the Corporate Website for its business purposes. Depending on the context, Catchpoint can use the information collected to respond to a visitor’s request, to communicate with visitors about Catchpoint and the Catchpoint Services, to allow its customers to log into the Corporate Website, or to otherwise operate, manage, and improve Catchpoint and the Catchpoint Services.  
Catchpoint does not sell, rent or lease the Personally Identifiable Information that it collects on the Corporate Website to third parties. The Personally Identifiable Information collected from the Corporate Website may be shared with Catchpoint’s affiliates, and with the service providers that work on Catchpoint’s behalf. Such information may also be disclosed by Catchpoint as required by law, valid court order, or other request from a governmental authority.

## Catchpoint Services

### Information collected by the Catchpoint Services about consumers

The Catchpoint Services measure the performance of our customers’ websites, web apps and web services (the “Web Properties”) by testing speed, reliability and availability. The Catchpoint Services run tests that model a consumer’s experience on a customer’s Digital Property using equipment located worldwide that is managed by Catchpoint Systems. In addition, the Catchpoint Service known as “Glimpse” (the “Glimpse Service”) is used by Catchpoint’s customers to measure a consumer’s actual experience of a Web Property. The Glimpse Service measures how fast a web page and its components load on a consumer’s browser to provide web developers with information to improve speed and reliability, and to detect and fix errors. With the exception of the Glimpse Service, the Catchpoint Services do not measure or collect information about actual consumer visits.

In connection with providing the Glimpse Service to a customer, Catchpoint collects the following information about a consumer from a customer’s Web Property:

  * Browser Information; and
  * Information about a consumer’s usage of the Web Property that our customer asks Catchpoint to collect, which can include, for example, factors such as the number of visits, the number of page views per visit, whether the visit results in a purchase or other transaction, and whether the Web Property produced any errors during the visit.



### How the Catchpoint Services collect information about consumers

Catchpoint Services use cookies and similar technologies, such as embedded scripts and web beacons (also known as tags or pixels), to collect the information described above. Cookies are used to associate a consumer’s web browser with the information our customers specify. Embedded scripts are used to measure how a consumer uses a Web Property. Web beacons are used to transfer information between the cookies and Catchpoint computers.

In addition, Catchpoint Services is authorized by its customers to set a Catchpoint Cookie on our customers’ Web Properties in connection with providing the Glimpse Service. These cookies are used by the Glimpse Service to recognize a returning visitor, and to determine the number of unique visitors to a Web Property.

### How Catchpoint uses the information it collects

The information collected by the Catchpoint Services on our customer’s behalf is owned by that customer, and our ability to use that information is limited by Catchpoint’s contract with our customer. Catchpoint is permitted to use that information to provide reporting and analysis services for our customer’s benefit.Catchpoint is also permitted to share “aggregated” information collected from many companies with our customers, prospective customers, and partners in order to improve our products and services, to provide reports and market research, and to understand market trends. Aggregated information does not identify individuals or our customers or website URLs. This aggregated information may be transferred to a successor in interest to Catchpoint, such as a company that acquires Catchpoint or the Catchpoint Services. Catchpoint is also permitted to disclose information as required by law, valid court order, or other request from a governmental authority.

### How Catchpoint’s customers use the information collected by Catchpoint

Our customers use the reports, analytics and metrics compiled by the Catchpoint Services to operate, identify issues on, improve and optimize their Web Properties. The Catchpoint Services help our customers to provide a better user experience to the people who use their Web Properties. To learn more about how a particular company or Web Property uses the information that Catchpoint collects on its behalf, please consult the privacy notice for that Web Property or company.

## Managing Cookie Settings

Some of the Catchpoint Services use cookies to help collect the information described above.

Please consult the instructions specific to your browser to change your cookie settings.

Your options with respect to a Web Property’s cookies (“first party cookies”) are explained in that Web Property’s or company’s privacy policy. Please consult the privacy policy for that Web Property or company for more information.
