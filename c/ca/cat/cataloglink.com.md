**Information Collection and Use**  
Altura International, Inc., the owner and operator of CatalogLink, is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. CatalogLink collects information from our users at several different points on our website. Information is collected when you: 

  * Register 
  * Place an order 
  * Make changes or additions to your account settings 
  * Use our Shopping/Gift Services such as Gift Registry and Catalog Requests 
  * Enter site contests, such as sweepstakes 
  * Participate in a site survey 
  * Use our customer service and feedback links to communicate with us 



**Registration**  
To make a purchase, request a catalog, redeem a gift certificate or coupon, send or redeem an eGift or create a gift registry on our site, you must first register with us. When filling out our registration form you are required to give your contact information (such as name, street address, phone number and email address). Your registration information becomes part of your personal account, which you can access by selecting the My Account tab at the top of our site.

During registration, you are given the opportunity to receive offers from different sources:

  * CatalogLink 
  * catalogs that you order from or request. 
  * CatalogLink marketing partners 

Selecting to receive offers from CatalogLink lets us know that you would like to occasionally receive email updates about new features on our site and special offers we think will interest you. Selecting to receive offers from "catalogs that I ordered from or request" tells us that it's okay for these catalogs to put you on their catalog mailing list. Selecting to receive offers from our marketing partners tells us that it's okay to share your contact information with third-party marketing partners. For more information on our sharing policies, please see **Sharing** below.

**Placing an Order**  
We request information from you in our checkout area when you place orders with any of the catalogs on our site. During checkout you must provide your credit card number and shipping address information if it's different than your default account. You also have the option to have your credit card information securely stored in your My Account for future use (see **My Account** below). After the checkout process is complete, your purchase information is securely forwarded to the catalog merchant you have made the purchase with. They will use this information so they can fulfill your order and contact you if they have questions regarding your order. In addition to your purchasing data, we forward all of your privacy settings to the catalog merchant. If you selected to receive offers from catalogs when you registered, or in your My Account privacy settings, then the catalog merchant may use your contact information to mail you catalogs, and/or send you special offers and email promotions.

**My Account**  
The personal information you enter during registration and/or during checkout is stored in your personal account area, also known as My Account. You can access My Account to add or change information, including changing your privacy settings, by entering the email address you used when you registered and the password you created. You also have the ability to add new credit card or shipping information to your My Account when placing an order. If you have elected to store your credit cards with us, we only display the last five digits of your credit card number in your account area. The full credit card information is stored on secure offline servers. For more information on how we protect your credit card information, please see our **Security** section below.

**Address Book**  
Your Address Book is the area in My Account where the billing address you enter during registration is stored. After registration, you also have the option to add shipping addresses. You can do this by going directly to My Account, or by entering a new shipping address when placing an order. Shipping addresses are used solely for the purpose of fulfilling your orders, and will not be used for any marketing purposes either by CatalogLink or the catalog merchant you have made the purchase with.

**Shopping/Gift Services**  
CatalogLink provides you with a number of Shopping and Gift services. Some of these require personal information in order to carry out the given task. For example, to create a Gift Registry you may want to provide us with the name of a second recipient other than yourself, or a shipping address if different than that in your address book. With services like eGifts, E-Cards, and "send this product to a friend" we will need to know the recipient's email address so that we can send the requested communication to them via email. If you choose to purchase a Gift Certificate, you will need to provide us with the recipient's name and email address or street address, depending on how you wish the certificate to be sent. These services only require the minimal amount of information necessary to carry out the task at hand and nothing more. Although we do store this information in our database for tracking purposes, we make no other use of it beyond which it was intended.

**Contests**  
In order to participate in CatalogLink sponsored contests or sweepstakes you will be required to provide us some information. Participation in these contests is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. You also have the option not to have the information you give us distributed to other third parties not specifically involved with the promotion. Information requested may include contact information (such as name, email address and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Contests may be managed by a third party and this third party is not allowed to use the information you supply us for any other purpose except to manage the contest. Prizes are provided directly from CatalogLink unless the contest is being sponsored by a catalog merchant or other specified third party. In this case, the prize will be awarded by the catalog merchant or third party and the information you provide will be shared with them.

**Surveys**  
From time to time our site requests information from you via surveys. Participation in a survey is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and customer satisfaction of our site.

**Customer Service / Feedback Links**  
CatalogLink uses an email link located on the Customer Service page to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have. We read every message and do our best to reply within 24 hours. The information you provide in these emails is used to respond directly to your questions or comments you may have.

We also have an email link located on our "Tell Us What You Think" page. This link allows you to give us feedback about our site and make suggestions on what we can do to improve it. We read every message sent in. We may file your comments to improve the site, or review and discard the information. We do not use the email address you supply us for any marketing purposes.

**Sharing**  
If you have agreed to receive offers from our catalog merchants, we will provide them your contact information when we forward your order or catalog request to them. They will then include you on their catalog mailing list.

If you have agreed to receive offers from third-party marketing partners, the personal information you have provided us and information about your order may be shared with third parties. This information may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from our records and other sources to make their future marketing efforts more effective. It may also be used by them to bring you offers of interest. If you prefer that your name and address not be shared with these third parties, do not select these options when you create your account and we will not share your information without your prior consent.

**Postal Address Info**  
If you have agreed to receive offers from CatalogLink we occasionally provide your name and postal address (but not your email address) to a select group of companies whose products you may find of interest. If you do not want us to share this information with these companies, we can add your name to our "do-not-share" list. Please email us at [donotshare@altura.com](mailto:donotshare@altura.com) with your name and postal address if you do not want us to share this information.

**Opt Out**  
CatalogLink gives you the option to opt out from receiving offers from us and the catalogs that you've made purchases from on our site. You can opt out by de-selecting "Yes, send me offers from CatalogLink" and "Yes, send me offers from catalogs that I order from or request." You can do this during the registration process or by going to the privacy settings in your account area (My Account) after you've registered. You can also opt out by e-mailing us, phoning us or writing us, using the contact information provided above. If you do not wish to receive offers from our marketing partners, simply leave that checkbox unchecked. Additionally, if you have previously agreed to receive offers from our catalog merchants and marketing partners, and would like to discontinue receiving these offers, you can do so by following the simple opt out procedures they provide in the email or contacting them directly.

**Security**  
Our website takes every precaution to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information, that information is protected both online and offline. Website security is reviewed regularly to ensure we are up to date with industry standards and technology.

Whether you're ordering a catalog or making a purchase, we want you to feel safe and secure while visiting CatalogLink. You can feel confident making purchases from established catalogs that have been in business for many years. To ensure that your credit card information is even more secure, use our secure transmission (SSL) when you give us your credit card information. We encrypt all credit card information and store it on a server that isn't accessible on the Internet. Once we store that information, it cannot be displayed anywhere on CatalogLink.

Internally, CatalogLink takes extra caution to limit access to customers' information. Only a few individuals within the company are given degrees of access to customers' personal information according to job function and necessity. Access is granted to these employees through special passwords. All employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure guarded environment.

**Cookies**  
CatalogLink uses cookies only for customer convenience. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We keep track of your CatalogLink ID and your name in the cookies we set on your browser. If you set your browser to reject cookies, usage of our site will be limited. For example, you will not be able to see the catalogs you have requested, your favorite catalogs, address book and your shopping cart without having to log in each time you visit CatalogLink. These cookie-based settings also allow us to welcome you back by name each time you return.

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

**Third Party Advertising**  
Some of our advertising is served by third party advertising companies which deliver a cookie to you so the ads you see can be tracked and ensures that you are not shown the same ad too many times. Since the third party advertising company only tags your computer with a number, they have no personal information about you. FreeShop.com does not provide these third party advertising companies with any personally identifiable information. However, these companies may use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the Altura Network and other sites in order to provide advertisements on our sites and other sites about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy).

**Log Files**  
CatalogLink uses our Web server log files to help track the performance of our site. We do not tie the IP addresses within the log files to your personally identifiable information.

**Legal Disclaimer**  
We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on our website.

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Privacy Policy page so you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point CatalogLink decides to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will take commercially reasonable measures to obtain email consent from you. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. We will still use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

**Links**  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, CatalogLink, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.
