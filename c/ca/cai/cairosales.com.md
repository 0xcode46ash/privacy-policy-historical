### Technical Methodologies

#### Log Files

As with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. Such information includes length of visit, pages visited, geographical location of visitor by IP address and other website browsing behavior. We use this information to improve our website and make it more responsive to the needs of visitors. 

#### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on our sites. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. We set a persistent cookie to store the contents of Shoppers' shopping carts so that if a Shopper closes his or her browser, the contents of the cart will be saved for a finite period of time, usually 1 hour. If you reject cookies, you may still use our sites, but you would not be able to benefit from that capability.

#### Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

For e-mail marketing communications, our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs). Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly in e-mails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

In the event Cairosales.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.
