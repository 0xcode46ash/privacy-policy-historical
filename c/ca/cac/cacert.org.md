Being a non-profit organisation, CAcert Inc. has yet to obtain any industry certification. We are trying to obtain funding for certification, as it is an expensive process. However, we wish to inform and assure all users of:

  * The type of information we gather from users of our service.
  * The ways in which we use this information.
  * The facilities we make available for you to check and correct any of the information we hold on you, including the facility to remove your data at any time.
  * Without giving away any secrets, the physical and logical security mechanisms we employ to protect your data.



### Introduction

Users of the Internet are becoming more aware of the need to protect private information about themselves. This applies when transmitting information across the Internet, but is even more important when giving private information to others, for whatever purpose.

CAcert Inc. is committed to providing a service in accordance with the [Cacert Inc. Mission Statement](http://www.cacert.org/index.php?id=2). We do our best to protect the privacy rights of our users at all times.

If you obtain services from CAcert, we will ask you for information about yourself that may be considered private. This information is only ever used for the specific purpose for which it was originally collected. This purpose will only be to identify you when you require access to our web site, or to create certificates, or to provide the service you require. We do not provide this information to any other party for any other purpose. We do not sell your information to anybody. We work very hard to protect this information from unauthorised access while it is in our possession.

Within the CAcert web site, there are links to other web sites that carry relevant information of services. CAcert does not make any statements about the privacy policies of these organisations and can not guarantee the protection of any information you may provide to these sites. We urge you to satisfy yourself of the suitability of privacy policies on these sites before providing any information.

### Privacy policy enforcement

CAcert Inc. relies on online users to report violations of posted privacy statements or specific privacy concerns. If there is a suspicion of non-conformance to the principles set out in this document, we will investigate. This document is provided to give some assurances that you can rely on our representations in this Privacy Statement.

If you feel that we are violating this Privacy Statement, please contact us at [support@cacert.org](mailto:support@cacert.org?Subject=/index.php?id=1&PHPSESSID=1dde8bf3277d884a7d4054c0bec5b1e0).

### What information do we collect?

#### Visitors

If you are just visiting the CAcert web site, we do not collect any personal information about you. We will only collect information about you if you join CAcert.

#### On joining CAcert

If you choose to 'join' CAcert to obtain one of our services, we will request certain information from you. Your email address is used as an account to identify you, and this email address, together with a password of your choosing, are the credentials used to gain access to certain areas of the CAcert web site. We will not send any unsolicited email for announcement or advertising purposes. We will, however, send critical security announcements to you if we feel your privacy or security might have been compromised.

During the enrolment process you will be asked to provide your first and last name, date of birth, nationality and an identification number from a photo ID or official identifying document. This information will only be used by 'Assurers' you contact during the [Reassurance](https://secure.cacert.org/assure.php?id=1) process to identify you and confirm your identity through your official identification papers. There is also a process where five questions and answers are recorded. These are only used by you in the event of a forgotten password.

#### Email certificate requests

On requesting a new email certificate, CAcert will require the email address to be associated with this certificate. If you have obtained enough points through the [Reassurance](https://secure.cacert.org/assure.php?id=1) program, thereby proving your identity, you can choose to include your name in the certificate. This enables you to use an email certificate to prove you were the originator of the email. Anyone checking an email signed with this certificate will see your email address in the certificate details. This may be the email address used when joining CAcert, or a new email address for which you later requested a certificate. At no time will CAcert send unsolicited email to either the joining email address or any secondary email addresses you supply to CACert, unless we feel your privacy or security may have been compromised.

#### Server certificate requests

On requesting a new server certificate, CAcert will require the domain name the server resides in, and the host name of the server the certificate is to be issued for. This process also requires you to create a certificate signing request (CSR). A CSR contains details about the server and the organisation it belongs to. These certificate details come under headings such as Organisation Name, Organisational Unit, Common Name, Country, State and City. This information is never used by CAcert for any purpose, other than to create the certificate.

#### Statistical information about your visit

When you visit our site, our computers may automatically collect statistics about your visit. This information does not identify you personally, but rather about a visit to our site. We may monitor statistics such as how many people visit our site, the user's IP address, which pages people visit on our site, from which domains visitors reach our site, and which browsers visitors use. We use these statistics about your visit for aggregation purposes only. These statistics are used to help us improve the performance of our Web site.

### Use of cookies

We don't use cookies.

### Requirement of disclosure

If we are required by law to disclose certain information to local, state, federal, national or international law enforcement authorities, we will do so.

### Updating or correcting your information

Any details you have submitted to CAcert can be modified by emailing [support@cacert.org](mailto:support@cacert.org?Subject=/index.php?id=1&PHPSESSID=1dde8bf3277d884a7d4054c0bec5b1e0).

You can also email [support@cacert.org](mailto:support@cacert.org?Subject=/index.php?id=1&PHPSESSID=1dde8bf3277d884a7d4054c0bec5b1e0?Subject=Privacy%23updco2) to update or correct any information in our records that is not contained in your digital certificate.

### Revoking (deactivating) your digital certificate

When a third party wants to rely on a digital certificate, it is important for them to know its status (for example, whether it is valid, suspended, or revoked). Third parties may do this by querying the status of a digital certificate via our web site. We do not generally delete digital certificates (and their content) from our on-line repository, because a third party might not then be able to check its status. You may, however, revoke (deactivate) your digital certificate. A revoked digital certificate will still appear in our repository, with an indication that it has been revoked.

### Your private key

The private key for digital encryption and signing is generated on your machine, and is not sent to CAcert. Its security therefore depends entirely on your system. We only receive the public key and identification information in the certificate request.

### Changes to this Privacy Statement

If a material change is made to this Privacy Statement, and/or the way we use our customers' personally identifiable information, prominent notice of the nature of the change will be posted on the first page of this Privacy Statement and on our home page.

### Mailing list

To stay informed about changes and suggestions, and to exchange ideas with other users, you can opt-in to our mailing list. A separate policy applies. Please see [lists.cacert.org](http://lists.cacert.org/mailman/listinfo/cacert) for more details.

### P3P

We are currently developing a P3P policy in XML to reflect this Privacy Statement. You can read more about the P3P protocol at [p3ptoolbox.org](http://www.p3ptoolbox.org/) or [cpsr.org](http://www.cpsr.org/).
