# Welcome to CAcert.org

### Privacy Policy

This policy discloses what information we gather about you when you visit any of our Web site. It describes how we use that information and how you can control it.

We collect two kinds of information about users: 1) data that users volunteer by signing up to our website or when you send us an email via our contact form; and 2) aggregated tracking data we collect when users interact with our site.

#### Personal information

When you post to the contact form, you must provide your name and email address. When you sign up to the website, you must provide your name, email address date of birth and some lost pass phrase question and answers.

We do not share your information with any other organisation.

#### Aggregated tracking information

We analyse visitors' use of our sites by tracking information such as page views, traffic flow, search terms, and click through. We use this information to improve our sites. We also share this anonymous traffic and demographic information in aggregate form with advertisers and other business partners. We do not share any information with advertisers that can identify an individual user.

#### Cookies

Some of our advertisers use a third-party ad server to display ads. These ads may contain cookies. The ad server receives these cookies, and we don't have access to them.

We don't use cookies to store personal information, we do use sessions, and if cookies are enabled, the session will be stored in a cookie, and we do not look for cookies, apart from the session id. However if cookies are disabled then no information will be stored on or looked for on your computer.

#### Notification of changes

If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on www.CAcert.org. If we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users via email. Users will be able to opt out of any new use of their personal information.
