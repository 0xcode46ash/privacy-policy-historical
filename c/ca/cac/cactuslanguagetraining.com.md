We Cactus Worldwide Ltd. are incorporated in England carrying on business as suppliers of language training and we are committed to protecting any data that we collect concerning you.  By using our services you agree to the use of the data that we collect in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**We are committed to protecting your privacy**

We collect the minimum amount of information about you that is commensurate with providing you with a satisfactory service.  This Policy indicates the type of processes that may result in data being collected about you.  Your use of this website gives us the right to collect that information.

**Information collected**

All personal information provided will be securely held on our database confidentially. Unless permission is given, we will not pass information such as your name, address, telephone number, fax number or email address to third parties unless deemed necessary in order to gather needed data to complete your booking, as indicated on the website. Where payment is processed via credit card, credit card numbers are not retained on our database.

[Data in relation to credit card payments is processed by HSBC plc. on a secure website linked to ours and they have their own privacy policy.]

**Information use**

We use the information collected primarily to process the task for which you visited the website.  Data collected in the UK is held in accordance with the Data Protection Act.  All reasonable precautions are taken to prevent unauthorised access to this information.  This safeguard may require you to provide additional forms of identity should you wish to obtain information about your account details.

**Cookies**

Your Internet browser has the in-built facility for storing small files – “cookies” – that hold information which allows a website to recognise your account.  Our website takes advantage of this facility to enhance your experience.  You have the ability to prevent your computer from accepting cookies but, if you do, certain functionality on the website may be impaired.

**Disclosing information**

We do not disclose any personal information obtained about you from this website to third parties except when we need to do so in order to complete the transaction – e.g. when arranging for a courier company to deliver goods that you have ordered.  We may also use the information to keep in contact with you and inform you of developments associated with our business.  You will be given the opportunity to remove yourself from any mailing list or similar device.  If at any time in the future we should wish to disclose information collected on this website to any third party, it would only be with your knowledge and consent.

We may from time to time provide information of a general nature to third parties, for example, the number of individuals visiting our website or completing a registration form, but we will not use any information that could identify those individuals.

**Changes to this Policy**

Any changes to our Privacy Policy will be placed here and will supersede this version of our Policy.  We will take reasonable steps to draw your attention to any changes in our Policy if you are on our mailing list. However, you should read this document each time you use the website to ensure that it meets with your approval.
