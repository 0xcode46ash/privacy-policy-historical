Protect Your Privacy Tips
We recognize the importance of our responsibility in
protecting your privacy. To assist you, we are providing the
following tips:
   • Use extreme caution, when disclosing your account
      number(s), social security number, etc., to others.
   • If someone calls you and explains that the call is on
      behalf of the Credit Union and asks for your account
      number, you should NOT disclose it. Our employees have
      access to your information and will not need to ask.
   • Keep all account numbers, card numbers, passwords
      and Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) in a
      protected place and separate from the card it offers
      access to (i.e., ATM, credit card or debit card). If the
      card is lost or stolen, the PIN could provide access to
      your card.
   • Maintain current information with the Credit Union
      (i.e., address and phone number). In case of fraudulent
      activity, this enables us to contact you immediately.
If you have comments or questions regarding this privacy
disclosure, please contact the Credit Union.
