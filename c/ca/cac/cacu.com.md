Protect Your Privacy Tips
We recognize the importance of our responsibility in
protecting your privacy. To assist you, we are providing the
following tips:
   • Use extreme caution, when disclosing your account
     number(s), social security number, etc., to others.
   • If someone calls you and explains that the call is on
     behalf of the Credit Union and asks for your account
     number, you should NOT disclose it. Our employees
     have access to your information and will not need to
     ask.
   • Keep all account numbers, card numbers, passwords
     and Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) in a
     protected place and separate from the card it offers
     access to (i.e., ATM, credit card or debit card). If the
     card is lost or stolen, the PIN could provide access to
     your card.
   • Maintain current information with the Credit Union
     (i.e., address and phone number). In case of
     fraudulent activity, this enables us to contact you
     immediately.
If you have comments or questions regarding this privacy
disclosure, please contact the Credit Union.
