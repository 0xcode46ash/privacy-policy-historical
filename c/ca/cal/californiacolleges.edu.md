**CALIFORNIACOLLEGES.EDU PRIVACY POLICY AND ITS EXCEPTIONS**  
Except as set forth below, the personally identifiable data you submit to CaliforniaColleges.edu is not made available or distributed to third parties, except with your express consent and at your direction. In particular, CaliforniaColleges.edu and Xap Corporation (Xap, the company that operates CaliforniaColleges.edu on behalf of CaliforniaColleges.edu) will not give, sell or provide access to your personal information to any company, individual or organization for its use in marketing or commercial solicitation or for any other purpose, except as is necessary for the operation of this site. 

**Exceptions to the Privacy Policy**  
There are limited exceptions to the CaliforniaColleges.edu privacy policy. When required by law to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, regulation or court order, CaliforniaColleges.edu or Xap will supply such information contained in your CaliforniaColleges.edu account as that organization reasonably determines, based on the advice of counsel, it is legally required to supply. In addition, CaliforniaColleges.edu or Xap may release specific information relevant to special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others or an attempted breach of security on the CaliforniaColleges.edu site.

**THE PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WE COLLECT**  
CaliforniaColleges.edu collects personal identifying information from you including your name, date of birth, address, e-mail address, telephone number, grade level and such additional information as you are required to provide by the college and financial aid applications that you choose to complete. 

**REASONS WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION**  
CaliforniaColleges.edu collects personal information from you for two reasons. The first reason is to enable CaliforniaColleges.edu to respond to your questions or contact you when necessary in connection with the functioning of CaliforniaColleges.edu. The second reason is to perform a task, such as filling out a college application, requested by you. When the effective functioning of a CaliforniaColleges.edu module does not require personal information, none is collected, and any such module can be accessed without opening an account or providing any personal data. 

When you log on to CaliforniaColleges.edu, your browser will automatically transmit to CaliforniaColleges.edu's server the IP address of your computer and type of browser you are using. Although your browser transmits the IP address of your computer, CaliforniaColleges.edu does not associate this IP address with any personally identifiable information regarding you. CaliforniaColleges.edu does not collect any personally identifiable information other than what users submit and their browsers transmit.

**MINIMUM AGE OF 13 REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AN ACCOUNT**  
CaliforniaColleges.edu will not collect any information from persons who are not yet 13 years old. If you are under 13 years of age, you will not be permitted to create an account on CaliforniaColleges.edu.

If you are 13 years of age or older, you are encouraged to create an account on CaliforniaColleges.edu and to utilize all of CaliforniaColleges.edu, which will help you plan, prepare and pay for your future education.

**WAYS IN WHICH PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION MAY BE USED**  
CaliforniaColleges.edu will use your personal identifying information to automatically fill out the following forms and surveys upon your instructions to do so:

  * Applications for admission 
  * Financial aid applications 
  * Freshman and transfer planners, which can assist you in selecting courses and otherwise planning to meet admission requirements 
  * Requests for information or material from colleges or other institutions you specify 

Your personal identifying information may also be used for the following purposes:  


  * We may use your identifying information to help diagnose problems with CaliforniaColleges.edu's server and to administer the CaliforniaColleges.edu website. 
  * Summary data representing a compilation of aggregate data representing CaliforniaColleges.edu users may be collected by Xap and provided to CaliforniaColleges.edu, which may provide such data to various colleges and other educational institutions represented on CaliforniaColleges.edu. No personal identifying information is made available as part of these summary reports. Some examples of summary data are the number of monthly visitors to the site, the number of admission applications submitted over CaliforniaColleges.edu, and the CaliforniaColleges.edu functions utilized by students in specified age ranges. 

**WITH WHOM PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED**  
In each of the circumstances described below, data specifically required to perform a task you request will be made available to a recipient you designate:  


  * If you submit an application for admission to a college or other educational institution, the personal data required to complete that application will be provided on your behalf to the admissions office of the institution to which you are applying. 
  * If you start an application for admission to a college or other educational institution, your name and other data entered on that application may be provided to the admissions office of that institution, even though you have not yet submitted that application to that institution. 
  * If you request that your data be transferred to FAFSA-on-the-Web to help you fill out your federal financial aid application, data relevant to that application will be provided to a processor specified and authorized to process your financial aid applications (FAFSA) by the U.S. Department of Education. 
  * If you request that a college or other educational institution send you material, your contact information will be provided to that institution. 

**SECURITY MEASURES TO PREVENT MISUSE OF INFORMATION ENTRUSTED TO CALIFORNIACOLLEGES.EDU**  
CaliforniaColleges.edu enables the data you input to be encrypted when in route between your browser and the CaliforniaColleges.edu server and when in route between the CaliforniaColleges.edu server and some other browser or server. This practice helps prevent unauthorized third parties from intercepting and gaining access to your private data during transmission over the Internet. CaliforniaColleges.edu uses 40-bit, Secure Socket Layer encryption supported by both Netscape's and Microsoft's browsers. 

Data residing on the CaliforniaColleges.edu server is password protected, and access is provided only to those employees of Xap who require such access to administer and maintain the CaliforniaColleges.edu system or to provide requested customer support to users of CaliforniaColleges.edu. Each Xap employee who has access to the data residing on the CaliforniaColleges.edu server has agreed in writing to respect the privacy of all such personal data. 

**COOKIES**  
A cookie is a small file that a website transfers to a user's computer, which may then be stored on its hard drive. CaliforniaColleges.edu uses cookies to remember you and personalize your web-viewing experience by keeping track of your session when logged on to CaliforniaColleges.edu. Cookies enable you to maintain continuity as you move from page to page on CaliforniaColleges.edu and to avoid the nuisance of being asked to provide the same information repeatedly. Cookies also allow us to make sure that only your browser can exchange information regarding your account with our servers. Cookies cannot be used to steal personal information or to gain access to information that you did not directly provide. The cookies we use are set when you log on to CaliforniaColleges.edu and are erased when you log off CaliforniaColleges.edu or completely close your browser. 

Don't want cookies?  
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you don't want cookies, you can set your browser to disable or refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being used. You should note, however, that various CaliforniaColleges.edu services might not function properly when cookies are not utilized. 

**LINKS**  
CaliforniaColleges.edu hosts links to other sites having privacy policies that may differ from those of CaliforniaColleges.edu. CaliforniaColleges.edu and Xap are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any websites to which CaliforniaColleges.edu links. 

**MODIFYING AND DELETING YOUR INFORMATION**  
You may update, otherwise modify or delete from the data stored on CaliforniaColleges.edu any personal information you previously provided. To modify personal information, (i) log on to CaliforniaColleges.edu, (ii) access either your user profile or an application containing the information you want to change, and (iii) modify that information using standard word-processing techniques. To delete personal information, (i) log on to CaliforniaColleges.edu, (ii) access your user profile, and (iii) delete the information you want to remove from CaliforniaColleges.edu using standard word-processing techniques. Please recognize that if you delete information, it will no longer be available on CaliforniaColleges.edu so that, for example, if a college to which you previously submitted an application were to attempt to retrieve that application from CaliforniaColleges.edu after you made the deletion the deleted information would no longer be accessible. Similarly, when accessed over CaliforniaColleges.edu information that has been updated or otherwise modified will appear in its then most current form, rather than in the form in which it may have been submitted at some earlier time.
