## 1\. **What kinds of information does Callaway Golf collect?**

Callaway Golf websites can collect information about you in a number of ways. One way we do this is by directly requesting information from you (such as on a product order form when you make a purchase, during customer service communications, as part of a sweepstakes or contest entry form, on registration pages, in response to a survey or on similar web pages where you are able to enter information into data fields and then send this information back to Callaway Golf). You may be asked to provide us with your name, address, credit card number, credit card expiration date, password reminders (such as your mother’s maiden name or the name of your favorite pet), phone number, fax number, email address, shipping address and similar information about you as an individual. We may also ask you questions about your golf game, your buying preferences or your lifestyle. We refer to all of this information as your " **Personal Information**."

Another way we collect information is by automatically recording information about your visit to our websites. For example, we might collect data regarding your activity while on our websites or record the web pages that you have chosen to visit. This is a common practice for many websites on the Internet. The information collected does not personally identify you, but may be helpful to us for marketing purposes or improving the services we offer. We refer to this type of information as " **General Data**." For example, we automatically log visitors' domain and IP addresses (a unique string of numbers that identifies a computer on the Internet). At times, this General Data may be combined with the Personal Information that you have provided. As described below, we also use cookies to enable the website to personalize your future visits and to help you navigate.

From time to time, you may also be given the opportunity to give us feedback about our products or services or to post messages for others to read. Sometimes this is done anonymously. Other times your name or other identifying features may be attached. This process will always be voluntary and we will explain to you how the information will be used whenever we ask for it.

Callaway Golf intends to give you as much control as possible over your Personal Information. In general, you can visit Callaway Golf on the Internet without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need your Personal Information in order to do such things as process an order, respond to your information requests or to allow you to participate in online promotions.

If you choose to give Callaway Golf Personal Information via the Internet, it is also our intent to let you know how we will use such information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this Personal Information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. For more information, you can call us at 800-200-4726 or 512-247-7617. You can also email [support@callawaygolfpreowned.com](mailto:support@callawaygolfpreowned.com) for more information or you can write to us by addressing requests to Internet Customer Service Representative, Callaway Golf Pre-Owned & Outlet, 9013 Tuscany Way, Building 1, Suite 110, Austin, Texas 78754.

You elect to receive these future contacts by “ **opting in** ” in the designated check box. Once you opt-in, you are granting us permission to use the Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy, including transferring and storing your Personal Information at one or more locations within the United States of America. Your election to opt-in also is your agreement that we may share your Personal Information with selected business partners and affiliates. The opt-in process further means that Callaway Golf and the entities that we share your Personal Information with (as described below) may contact you directly in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Whenever we share Personal Information pursuant to this Privacy Policy, we will inform the party receiving it that the Personal Information may only be used for a specific, limited purpose in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as agreed upon in advance by Callaway Golf.

If you provide us with your mailing address, telephone number or facsimile number, and tell us that we may contact you, we may also get in touch with you by one of these methods.

## 5\. **What happens when I make an online purchase at a Callaway Golf website?**

Callaway Golf collects and stores Personal Information that you provide to us when you make an online purchase, conduct certain online transactions or communicate offline with our customer service department. When you place an order, open an account or make certain inquiries, you will be asked to provide various Personal Information that we will collect, use and store as described in this Privacy Policy. Among other things, this Personal Information will be used to facilitate your online transactions (including the processing and shipping of your orders), send you order-related confirmations and provide you with customer service support. This Personal Information also may be used to contact you about sales, special offers and new site features, unless you have elected not to receive promotional communications in connection with this website.

In some instances, your Personal Information will be shared with and stored by third parties who perform services and carry out functions on our behalf and/or in connection with an order. These include, among others, third party payment and order processors, our network of fulfillment entities (such as local retailers and other product distributors), package delivery services, data management and analysis companies, marketing professionals, fraud protection services, website evaluators and the like.

For example, we may disclose Personal Information that we collect about you to third parties who we use to provide order processing, fulfillment, financial, marketing or other services on our behalf or as otherwise permitted or required by law. In some cases, we use these companies or individuals to service, process and fulfill transactions, to protect against fraud, for institutional risk control, to respond to judicial process or to perform other duties on our behalf. 

We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources, to enable us to update and correct the Personal Information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations and special offers that we think will interest you.

## 6\. **Where does Callaway Golf store this information and is it secure?**

Callaway Golf operates in many countries throughout the world. To enable us to offer consistent service to our customers, wherever they may live, we manage most of our Internet sites from within the United States. Information may be collected outside of the U.S. and transferred to the U.S. in certain instances. Information that we collect may also be transferred to and stored by third parties who perform services and carry out functions on our behalf and/or in connection with an order. These include, among others, third party payment and order processors, our network of fulfillment entities (such as local retailers and other product distributors), package delivery services, data management and analysis companies, marketing professionals, fraud protection services, website evaluators and the like. 

Callaway Golf takes precautions to protect your Personal Information, including our policy of allowing access to this Personal Information to only to those individuals and entities with a need to know. We also use available technology and encryption, when legally required or when appropriate for your protection, to provide a more secure environment and to reduce the chance of unauthorized access.

Personal Information is stored in a secure environment protected by a combination of physical and technical measures. The information may be kept in separate locations or it may be aggregated into reports, lists or databanks. There is no general public access to this information. In some cases, the Personal Information may be encrypted before you conduct your transaction, using appropriate secure technology. If you send us correspondence such as email or postal mail, or contact us by phone, we may collect such information in a file specific to you. These files will also be stored in secure locations.

Always keep in mind, however, that the Internet is not a secure system and you should be cautious about the information you disclose while you are online. Although we take steps to protect your Personal Information against loss, misuse and alteration, as is the case with all computer networks linked to the Internet, we cannot absolutely guarantee the security of your Personal Information provided over the Internet and we will not be responsible for loss, misuse or alteration of the Personal Information.

Otherwise, the information will be stored in a secure and protected environment for as long as we believe it necessary to serve you and to carry out the other purposes for which we collected the Personal Information and General Data.

## 8\. **Does Callaway Golf share this information with anyone?**

We understand that your privacy is important to you. It is our policy not to disclose Personal Information about our website visitors without your explicit consent.

(References in this Privacy Policy to "Callaway Golf," "our," "we" or "us" mean all of the Callaway Golf Companies.

**Marketing, Advertising and Website Hosting Companies:** Occasionally, the Callaway Golf Companies utilize the services of outside agencies, companies or individuals to run marketing campaigns, respond to information requests, coordinate contests, sweepstakes and promotions or to host or operate websites and web pages that are connected with our business. We may also contract with third parties to help us better understand your web usage preferences or to analyze data that we collect on our websites and elsewhere. To the extent that Personal Information is shared with these third parties, we will inform them that the Personal Information may only be used for a specific, limited purpose in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as agreed upon in advance by Callaway Golf. 

**Consultants and Corporate Service Providers:** The Callaway Golf Companies may use third parties to help us operate various aspects of our business. This might include people or companies that we bring in to help us understand how to more efficiently operate our business. It also might include third parties that we may use to outsource or help facilitate one or more aspects of our business (e.g. order fulfillment, customer service, co-branding issues, manufacturing, payment processing, etc.).

We are not responsible for the policies and practices of other companies.

Any Personal Information that Callaway Golf receives from third parties is subject to the privacy polices of those entities. We are not responsible for the policies and practices of other companies.

For example, some companies may require you to opt-out of their information exchange programs. In those instances, Callaway Golf may receive and/or use information gathered by these outside companies or agencies, and the handling and processing of your data will be governed by such third parties’ policies and not by this Callaway Golf policy.

## 12\. **What about the privacy of children?**

Protecting the privacy of children is important. Our website is not directed at children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly solicit or collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13.

We do not sell or ship any items ordered through this website to anyone who we know to be under the age of 18.

If you choose not to provide Personal Information, you will still, in most cases, be able to use many of the website features. However you will not be able to access areas that require registration or participate over the Internet in contests, sweepstakes or similar promotions, nor will you be able to make purchases.

Even if you do not provide Personal Information, we will sometimes collect anonymous information about how you have used the website. This is information that does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing or improving the services we offer.
