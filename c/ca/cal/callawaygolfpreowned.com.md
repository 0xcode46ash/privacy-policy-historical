At Callaway Golf Pre-Owned, a subsidiary of Trade Up Commerce, Inc. we are committed to respecting your privacy. The following sets forth our information gathering and usage practices for information collected at this Web site.

## Information Gathered At This Web Site

Callaway Golf Pre-Owned automatically collects anonymous information about usage of this Web site. For instance, when you visit this Web site, it recognizes the type of browser you are using, the address of the internet service provider you are using, the addresses you visit at the site, and similar information. None of this information identifies you personally.

Callaway Golf Pre-Owned may collect certain anonymous information from users of this Web site by using "cookies." A cookie is a small file that your browser stores on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. Cookies help visitors move more quickly through our Web site. When you sign on to the Callaway Golf Pre-Owned Web site, we may pass cookies on to your computer. If you do not want to accept cookies, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie from this Web site, some parts of this Web site may perform less efficiently. The Callaway Golf Pre-Owned Web site may contain links to third-party Web sites which also may use cookies. Please review the third-party Web sites for their specific privacy policies.

On certain pages such as the "Send This Page to a Friend" page, you may voluntarily provide us with names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, and similar information. Callaway Golf Pre-Owned takes precautions to protect your personal information, including allowing access only to those Callaway Golf Pre-Owned employees with a need to know and using available technology and encryption to provide a secure environment and to prevent unauthorized access.

## Internal Use of Information

We store on our server the information you provide us, as well as the anonymous information that is automatically collected.

We may use the anonymous information to understand better how this Web site is being used.

We may use personal information that you have voluntarily provided to provide the goods or services that you have requested, to adjust this Web site to your personal preferences, to send to you via email or postal mail newsletters, new product announcements or other information that we feel may be of value to you, and for other similar business purposes.

## Contests and Sweepstakes

We attempt to create sweepstakes, contests and content which require a very minimal amount of information from our users. The sweepstakes and contests conducted on our Web site sometimes ask users for contact information (like their email addresses) or information about their hobbies, interests or products that they use. This information is used for internal purposes and for use in the marketing of our products and services and will not be shared with any party except as set forth in this Privacy Policy and in our Terms and Conditions. See our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.callawaygolfpreowned.com/terms.html) for further information.

## Sharing of Information With Third Parties

Callaway Golf Pre-Owned may share the information collected at this Web site with its subsidiaries and affiliates for use as described in the "Internal Use Of Information" section above. Callaway Golf Pre-Owned does not share any of this information with third parties except marketing companies engaged by Callaway Golf Pre-Owned to conduct marketing campaigns or promotions under the direction and control of Callaway Golf Pre-Owned. Callaway Golf Pre-Owned maintains ownership and control of this information.

## Opting Out

You may at any time opt out of receiving further communications via email. When you receive an email from us, you will be given the option of replying with an instruction to delete your name from our email list. Please note, however, that you may be added again to our email list if you subsequently participate in other promotions or submit further personal information at this Web site.

If you would like to opt out of receiving further communications, please send a blank unsubscribe email to the unsubscribe address located at the bottom of every email message we send you, or contact our [Consumer Service Department](mailto:%20support@callawaygolfpreowned.com).

## Corrections and Updates

You can change or modify any information you have previously provided to us by contacting our [Consumer Service Department](mailto:%20support@callawaygolfpreowned.com).

## Security

The security of the information regarding your order is very important to us. We use the 128-bit Secure Socket Layer protocol to protect the security of your online order information. SSL technology encrypts your order information to protect it from being decoded by anyone other than Callaway Golf Pre-Owned.

Once you enter the checkout page your computer will begin communicating with a server in secure mode. You can tell that you are in secure mode by the following:

  * The "http" in the web address will be replaced by "https"
  * Depending on the browser, you will see either a padlock (Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, Netscape Communicator) or a solid key (Netscape Navigator) in the lower section of the browser window.



Only browsers that use the 128-bit Secure Socket Layer protocol are able to order through the Callaway Golf Pre-Owned web site. If your browser does not support SSL, you can get an upgrade at Microsoft's or Netscape's home page.

## Modifications of Our Policy

From time to time, we may modify our Privacy Policy. Such modifications will be effective on the date that we post the modified Policy on our Web site.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or about this Web site in general, please contact our [Consumer Service Department](mailto:%20support@callawaygolfpreowned.com).
