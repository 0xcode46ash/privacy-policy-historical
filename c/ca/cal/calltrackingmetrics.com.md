Also, for clarification, this Privacy Policy applies if you are a visitor to the CallTrackingMetrics Site or if you purchase the Services. If you use a third party application or service that is integrated with CallTrackingMetrics, then such third party's privacy policy will govern the use, storage and disclosure of your data in connection with such application or service. CallTrackingMetrics may receive orders, subpoenas or other legal demands for Personally Identifiable Data that has been collected on behalf of such third party providers through the use of their applications or services. In such cases, CallTrackingMetrics refers the party requesting the Personally Identifiable Data to the applicable third party provider. That provider will respond in accordance with its own policies and may disclose your Personally Identifiable Data in response to such subpoena or other demand for information. Please remember that CallTrackingMetrics is not responsible for the policies and practices of such third party providers. If you have questions about any such disclosures, you should contact the applicable provider directly. CallTrackingMetrics will have no liability in connection with any act or omission of any such provider with respect to your data or information or otherwise. 

CallTrackingMetrics takes reasonable precautions such as policy-based access control to protect Data in our possession from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access. CallTrackingMetrics follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the Data, both during transmission and once received by CallTrackingMetrics. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While CallTrackingMetrics strives to protect your Data, CallTrackingMetrics does not guarantee its security.
