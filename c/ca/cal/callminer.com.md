> 
> Personal Information
> 
> CallMiner.com may ask you to register and provide information that personally identifies you, such as name, e-mail address, mailing address or phone number ("Personal Information"). This will occur in certain circumstances, including for example, when you download trial software or purchase software among others. We use your Personal Information for three primary purposes:  
> 
> 
> | **a)** | To enable you to find or gain access to information, software or services on our web site.   
>   
> ---|---  
> **b)** | To register your license and rights, if any, to technical support.   
>

>   
> CallMiner, Inc. ("CallMiner") will not provide your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, or any other Personal Information to any third parties except for Authorized Resellers. We may, from time to time, select other companies with pertinent information or products we think might be appropriate for you, and send you that information on behalf of that third party. To accomplish that, we would not disclose your Personal Information to them.  
>  If you do not desire us to send you information on third party products, please let us know by sending us e-mail with your Personal Information. Similarly, if you don't want CallMiner to send you e-mail or postal mail regarding CallMinerâ€™s products, services, or special offers, let us know by sending us an e-mail to [ sales@callminer.com](mailto:sales@callminer.com).
> 
> Online Registration
> 
> When you register a product, whether purchased online directly from CallMiner or otherwise, we store the Personal Information you give us on a secure server. That information is treated in the same manner as any Personal Information 
> 
> In some countries, CallMiner is represented by an exclusive reseller who provides marketing, sales, and support services on behalf of CallMiner in the interest of providing better service to customers residing in that country. When you submit your Personal Information to CallMiner, you understand and agree that if you reside in a country where an Exclusive Reseller represents CallMiner, CallMiner may forward your customer profile to that Reseller. Your personal information will not be leased, sold, rented or otherwise made available to any other third party except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws, police investigations, or in legal proceedings where such information is relevant.
