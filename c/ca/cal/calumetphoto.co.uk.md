# Privacy Policy - CALUMET

**We believe in keeping your personal information private**

»  **Personal Information:**  
Any information you provide online will only be used to enhance your online experience at calumetphoto.com. Unless you specifically indicate otherwise, your email address will never be sold or shared with any other company. That's our guarantee. 

»  **Your Mailing Address:**  
When you register on our site, you will be asked for your name and address information. We ask for this information because without it we can't determine freight prices accurately for your shopping cart. If, when you register, you prefer not to receive catalogs, just indicate that on the registration form. You can always change your preference at a later date. 

»  **Email Addresses:**  
We occasionally send HTML emails with special offers, events, discounts, and news to registered users. We respect your privacy, and your email address will never be sold or shared with other organizations. You have the option, during registration, or at any time thereafter, to opt-out of this free service.
