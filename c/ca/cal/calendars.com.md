Privacy Policy - Revised 9/20/12   
  
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting Calendars.com or DogBreedStore.com, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. 

  **Information Collection**

When you visit the site, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes the pages visited and the types of products purchased. We then aggregate this information with thousands of other pieces of information to improve our site and make your shopping time on the site as valuable and efficient as possible.

  We are not in the business of selling customer information to others. We share customer information only as described below and with affiliates of Calendars.com L.L.C. that either are subject to this privacy policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this privacy policy. 

  
 

  * **Third-Party Service Providers:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
  * **Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in this privacy policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Calendars.com L.L.C., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 
  * **Protection of Calendars.com and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Calendars.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this privacy policy. 
  * **With Your Consent:** Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 



 

  **Information We Need**

When you order, we need to know your name, email address, shipping address, billing address, phone number, and credit card number with expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. We ask for your phone number in the event that our customer service representatives or delivery services need to contact you about your order. To simply create an account, we will only need your name, email address, and a password. 

  We may maintain information that you explicitly provide to us in the course of placing orders or creating personalized products.

  Any engagement with social media sites, such as Facebook, is governed by the privacy policies of those entities.

  **Saved Information**

We save the information about products you purchased to provide you with the best possible customer service and the most up-to-date information about your order. You can view your past and current orders online by logging into the My Account section with your private password. 

    **Changing Your Information**

If at any time you would like to change any information in your account, just go to the My Account link in the upper right-hand corner of each page. Here you can change or update your email address and password, billing address, payment options, shipping options, address book, and email preferences. Be sure to click Save My Changes when you have updated your account. If you forget your password, we will require verification of your identify before making any changes. 

  **To remove your name** from our special email bulletins, please click on the link located at the bottom of each promotional email or edit your email option in [your account](https://www.calendars.com/user/login.jsp)[.](https://www.calendars.com/user/login.jsp)

  Our policy is intended to provide you with the safest and most secure shopping experience possible. Since the law, offerings and technologies change, we reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of our privacy policy at any time without prior notice. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact our [Customer Service](http://www.fuzeqna.com/calendars/consumer/question.asp?catid=36) team.
