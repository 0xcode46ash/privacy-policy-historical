# Privacy Policy | California Academy of Sciences

This is the official privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") of the California Academy of Sciences ("Academy" or "we", "us" or "our") and describes how we handle Personal Information (as defined below) you provide to us or that we collect from you through the use of our Website, which is located at www.calacademy.org, and any replacement, substitute or backup websites and web pages that are associated with our website, including the Academy Store. 

_Personal Information_

You can browse our Website without being required to divulge any Personal Information to us. Although we collect and maintain aggregate anonymous information about usage and visitors browsing our Website, no Personal Information is collected as part of this process. 

When we use the term "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we mean information such as your first/middle initial or name, last name, e-mail address, street address, mailing address if different, town or city, state, zip code, telephone number, date of birth, credit card information, and any other information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you. We may collect Personal Information about you when you purchase an Academy membership, purchase Academy tickets online, make a donation to the Academy online, register for an Academy event or participate in an Academy contest or sweepstakes. Personal Information also includes information collected and maintained through the use of our Website about your personal preferences, survey responses and your relationship with us (for example, if you are a subscriber to Academy eNews). 

The Academy may use the Personal Information that you provide in order to send you Academy eNews, provide you with information regarding the Academy and Academy services and opportunities by means of, but not limited to web, email, mail, and text, process Academy memberships, or to administer and maintain our Website and, if applicable, your subscription to Academy eNews. When you provide us with this Personal Information, you are consenting to receive each issue of our Academy eNews and any related emails. You may subscribe or unsubscribe to Academy communications at any time by following the links provided or by visiting our Website at [www.calacademy.org/enews/](https://web.archive.org/enews/) and submitting your subscription preferences along with your registered email address in the space provided. Any credit card information you provide in connection with a transaction will be used only as needed to process that transaction. 

If you are a Subscriber, you must give us current, complete and accurate information and keep the information you provide to us up to date. We cannot and shall not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us current, accurate, truthful or complete information or you fail to update the information you give us. 

The Academy does not share, sell, rent or lease any Personal Information that you provide with any unaffiliated third parties unless you authorize us to do so by opting-in. The term "unaffiliated third parties" or "third parties" does not include any subsidiaries or affiliates of the Academy. The exception to this policy is that we may share your personal information with other Bay Area cultural organizations through mailing list exchanges, for which you will have the ability to opt out. 

_Children_

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children or knowingly allow children to purchase goods or memberships through our website. Visitors 12 years of age and younger must obtain an adult's permission before submitting any personal information to this or any other website. In the event that we learn that we have received any personal information from a visitor 12 years of age or younger, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have information from or about a child 12 years of age or younger, please contact us at [webservices@calacademy.org](mailto:webservices@calacademy.org). 

_Unaffiliated Third Parties_

Unless authorized by you through your opt-in, or as provided above, we will make your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties only in the following circumstances: 

  * If we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process); 
  * If we believe your actions violate a law, regulation, this Privacy Policy or any applicable Website terms of use, or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of us, our Website, any other users or third party; 
  * If, in our sole discretion, we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect our assets, to defend our interests or comply with our legal and regulatory obligations; or 
  * If there is a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving the Academy.



_Use of Outside Vendors_

We may from time to time retain qualified third-party vendors to help us manage the Website and allow us to better serve Academy visitors. These may include third-party vendors we engage to analyze the information we collect on the Academy Website, for marketing or similar purposes. We require all vendors to maintain the security of all information to which they are provided access, and restricts the vendors from using the information in any way not authorized by the Academy.

In addition, the Website may provide links to resources we believe may be useful. These links will lead you to websites operated by third parties that operate under different privacy policies. We encourage you to review those privacy policies, as the Academy Privacy Policy does not apply to such sites, and we have no control over information you may submit to those third parties or how they may use the information you provide to them.
