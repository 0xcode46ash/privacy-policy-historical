# California Coast Credit Union - Privacy Policy

Online Privacy Policy

California Coast Credit Union (“Credit Union”) is a member-owned financial cooperative overseen by a Board of Directors you elect. At California Coast Credit Union, our members’ privacy is a top priority. Protecting personal information and using it in a manner consistent with your expectations is also a top priority for us and everyone associated with us. **You do not need to “Opt Out” of any Information Sharing**. We do not sell your personal financial information to telemarketers, direct-mail vendors, or other marketing agencies and we do not disclose personal financial information about you to third parties unless it is done to conduct the business of the Credit Union, or as permitted or required by law.

This document outlines our Privacy Policy for visitors to our website (“site”), as well as for members who apply for or obtain services from us. Visitors to our site remain anonymous, unless they register for a service or otherwise elect to disclose their identity to us. Although we do not collect personally identifiable information (“personal information”) about persons who simply visit our site, we may collect certain limited information about visitors, such as their IP address. We reserve the right to change this Online Privacy Policy, along with related procedures, at any time. This Policy will inform you of:

We may use cookies to gather information about your preferences and interests in our products and services. Any information gathered in this way will be used to tailor your experience on our site and to provide content that we think might interest you. We also use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements within the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personal information.

We may keep personal information you provide to us, along with information we collect from outside sources, so that we can offer you accounts and services tailored to meet your financial needs. The information you provide to us through online surveys and promotions on the site will be used for internal marketing purposes, as well as for the development of new services and information on the site. This information will remain confidential and will not be shared or sold to third parties.

We provide online tools and calculators on the site to assist visitors in making financial decisions. We do not capture the personal information you provide when using these tools.

**We Limit the Sharing of Information**  
We will disclose information you have provided or that we or our affiliates have obtained about your accounts and the transactions associated with your accounts to third parties, agents, and other representatives in the following instances: 

  * To conduct the business activities of the Credit Union which includes printing statements, ordering checks, receiving check items from the Federal Reserve Bank, reporting to credit bureaus and mailing marketing materials and monthly statements;
  * With your consent; and
  * As permitted or required by law which includes sharing with law enforcement and regulatory agencies to comply with subpoenas and reporting for money laundering and other criminal activity



To protect our members’ privacy, we only work with companies that agree to maintain strong confidentiality protections and limit the use of information we provide. We do not permit these companies to share the member information we provide with other third parties.

If you terminate your membership or become an inactive member, we will not share information we have collected about you, except as permitted or required by law.

**We Protect Your Information**  
We maintain strong security policies and controls to ensure that information in our files and computers is protected. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards. This includes up-to-date security technology to safeguard your information from unauthorized access. Electronic connections (such as Cal Coast ONLINE and Bank-by Phone) are communicated in a secure mode, encrypting information before it is transmitted so that unauthorized access will not compromise your information. 

E-mails that you may send without logging in to Cal Coast ONLINE may not be secure. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as social security or account numbers to us through an unsecured email.

We provide a number of additional security features for Cal Coast ONLINE. After logging in, Cal Coast ONLINE will “timeout” after 15 minutes of inactivity. If you enter your password incorrectly more than 6 times, your access to Cal Coast ONLINE will be locked until you contact us to reactivate it. We monitor and record invalid login attempts to detect any suspicious activity, such as someone trying to guess your password.

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.

**Information About Former Members**  
We will not share information collected about former members or non-members, except as may be permitted or required by law.

**Children’s Privacy**  
We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children on our site. See our online privacy disclosure titled “Privacy Policy for Googolplex: The Credit Union Guide for Student Moneymakers” for details.
