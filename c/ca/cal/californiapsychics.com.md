I Introduction 

> In order to operate the California Psychics service and to reduce the risk of fraud, Outlook Amusements, Inc. (“California Psychics ,” "californiapsychics.com" or “we”) must ask you to provide us information about yourself and your credit card and/or bank account. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect and how we use that information. California Psychics takes the privacy of your personal information very seriously and will use your information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information or a list of our customers to third parties. However, as described in more detail below, there are limited circumstances in which some of your information will be shared with third parties, under strict restrictions, so it is important for you to review this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all services that are hosted on the californiapsychics.com web site, whether the services are offered by Outlook Amusements, Inc. or by its subsidiaries. 
> 
> If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [help@californiapsychics.com ](mailto:help@californiapsychics.com)or 1.800.573.5718.   
>  **  
> Notification of Changes**  
>  This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the California Psychics service or as we incorporate suggestions from our customers. If we are going to use or disclose your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected the information, you will have a choice as to whether or not we use or disclose your information in this new manner. Any material changes will be effective only after we provide you by email with at least 30 days' notice of the amended Privacy Policy (if you have closed your account, you will not be contacted to notify you of the amended Policy and your personal information will not be used or disclosed in this new manner). 
> 
> We will post the amended Privacy Policy prominently on our web site so that you can always review what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Please check the californiapsychics.com web site at [www.californiapsychics.com](http://www.californiapsychics.com/) at any time for the most current version of our Privacy Policy. 
> 
> Californiapsychics.com may include links to third party Web sites. These sites are governed by their own privacy statements, and Outlook Amusements is not responsible for their operations, including but not limited to their information practices. Users submitting information to or through these third party Web sites should review the privacy statement of these sites before providing them with personally identifiable information. 

II Information We Collect 

> **Required Information**  
>  To register for our site, you must provide your name, email address and date of birth. In order to make payments through californiapsychics.com, you must also provide valid credit card or debit card information as well as your billing address and phone number. 
> 
> Information About You From Third Parties In order to protect all our customers against potential fraud, we verify with third parties the information you provide. In the course of such verification, we receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you register a credit card or debit card with californiapsychics.com, we will use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen. 
> 
> **Web Site Traffic Information**  
>  Because of the way that World Wide Web communication standards work, when you arrive at or leave the californiapsychics.com web site, we automatically receive the web address of the site that you came from or are going to. We also collect information on which pages of our site you visit while you are on the californiapsychics.com site, the type of browser you use and the times you access our web site. We use this information only to try to understand our customers' preferences better and to manage the load on our servers, so as to improve our service and your experience with californiapsychics.com. We do not track the Web sites that you visit before or after you leave the californiapsychics.com site. 
> 
> **Our Use of “Cookies”**  
>  ”Cookies” are small files of data that we send to your computer to allow us to recognize you as a California Psychics customer if you return to the californiapsychics.coim site using the same computer and browser. 
> 
> We also use cookies to occasionally display your email address on our sign-in form, so that you don't have to retype the email address each time when you log in to your account. 
> 
> **Customer Service Correspondence**  
>  If you send us correspondence, including emails, we retain such information as well as customer service correspondence and other correspondence from California Psychics to you. We retain these records in order to measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate potential fraud and violations of our Terms of Service. We may, over time, delete these records if permitted by law. 

III Our Use and Disclosure of Information 

> **Internal Uses**  
>  We use the information we collect about you in order 1) to provide our services and process your transactions, 2) to provide customer service, 3) to determine your eligibility to receive offers for special features or products, and 4) to improve our products and services. At your option, we use the information you provide to access specific third party services on your behalf and perform the actions that you request us to perform, such as invoicing winning bidders on behalf of auction sellers. 
> 
> We give access to individually identifiable information about our users only to those employees who require it to fulfill customer service requests. 
> 
> **Disclosure to Third Parties**  
>  Outlook Amusements will not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to third parties. We will not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described below, or with your express permission. These third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information is shared. 
> 
> We share information with companies that help us process the transactions you request and protect our customers' transactions from fraud, such as sharing your credit card number with a service that screens for lost and stolen card numbers. See “Information About You From Third Parties” above. Additionally, if you go into a negative balance and owe us money, we may share information with processing companies including collection agencies. 
> 
> We disclose the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. These companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit using the information except to market the specified products or services, unless you have affirmatively agreed or given your prior permission for other uses. 
> 
> We disclose information that we in good faith believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Service. Specifically, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information (but not bank account or credit card information) to victims who request it. 
> 
> We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. When a user signs up for a co-branded version of californiapsychics.com or through links on our partner's website, we will share with the co-branded partner that user's name and email address in order to provide enhanced integration between our services and the services of our partner. 
> 
> We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users live in California . However, this aggregated information is not tied to personally identifiable information. 
> 
> We may offer products and services provided by various partners. In the event that a user accepts any of these various offers, the users information may be transferred to the partner to facilitate the transaction. At such a point, the user may also become a customer of that partner, and subject to that partner's privacy policy, which may differ materially from ours. 
> 
> As with any other business, it is possible that californiapsychics.com in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by Outlook Amusements, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described above. 
> 
> 

> 
> **Our Contact with Customers**  
>  We communicate with users on a regular basis via email to provide requested services, and we also communicate by phone to resolve customer complaints or investigate suspicious transactions. We use your email address to confirm your opening of a California Psychics account, to send you notice of transactions through californiapsychics.com site, to send information about important changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures required by law. Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional. 
> 
> We may also use your email address to send you other types of communications that you can control, including horoscopes newsletters, special offers and notice of special third-party promotions. You can choose whether to receive some, all or none of these communications. 

IV Information Security 

> Outlook Amusements is committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security. Your credit card and bank account information are stored only in encrypted form on computers that are not connected to the Internet. We restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information. We test our security systems regularly and also contract with outside companies to audit our security systems and processes. 
> 
> **Internet Address Information**  
>  We use IP addresses, browser types and access times to analyze trends, administer the site, improve site performance and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
