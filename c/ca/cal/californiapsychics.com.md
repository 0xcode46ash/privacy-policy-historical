You may be able to talk to a psychic, enter contests, participate in surveys, subscribe to a service (like our horoscopes), take quizzes, post to message boards, or participate in a chat room. The types of personally identifiable information (i.e. information that can directly identify you or indicate where you might be contacted) that may be collected on these pages includes: name, address, age, date of birth, sex, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various services. We do not ask for, access, or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile services. 

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information (i.e. generic information that does not identify you personally) when you visit any of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox), your IP address, the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows or Mac) and the domain name of your Internet service provider. 

**How We Use the Information.**  
We will use the personal information you provide online for the purpose(s) you have submitted. Examples of using your personal information for the purpose(s) submitted include if you sign up for horoscopes, we will send an e-mail with your horoscope for the day or, if you have won a contest, we will send you an email notification that you have won. In addition, we may send you an e-mail offering products or services which we think you may be interested in or to ask you to participate in a survey. If you want us to stop using the personal information you provided in these ways, please contact us at [Privacy@californiapsychics.com](mailto:Privacy@californiapsychics.com). 

**Use of Anonymous Information.**  
We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze how our site is used, as well as to offer you products, programs or services. We may also share aggregate information with others, including affiliated companies and non-affiliated companies. 

**How We Share Your Personal Information.**  
We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We will not share the personal information you provide except: 

(a) if it is for the purpose(s) you provided it; (b) with your consent; (c) as may be required by law or as we think necessary to protect our company or others from injury (for example, in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request, when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or property of another, or when we believe that someone has violated our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.californiapsychics.com/about/Terms-of-Service.aspx)); (d) with other persons or companies with whom we contract to carry out internal site operations or our business activities (for example, third party contractors - see below); and/or (e) notifying you when we make changes to one of our subscriber agreements or this policy. 

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). The personal information you provide is considered a company asset and may be included among transferred assets if California Psychics, any or all of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any of their assets, is ever acquired by a third party. 

**Sharing with Service Providers**

Our operations and maintenance contractors sometimes have limited access to your personally identifiable information in the course of providing products or services to California Psychics. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with credit card processing, e-mail distribution technology, services, and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our Web site. Access to your personally identifiable information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the contractor to perform its limited function for California Psychics. We also contractually require that our operations and maintenance contractors 1) protect the privacy of your personally identifiable information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and 2) not use or disclose your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than providing us with products and services as required by law. 

**Our Psychics/Your Privacy**

**Note that our psychics are independent contractors and not employed directly by California Psychics. We contractually require that our psychics protect the privacy of your personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy and not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than providing you with the services you request through the Web site or by phone. You should also take care to protect your personal information and privacy. There is no reason that you should provide any of our psychics with personal contact information, specific financial information including but not limited to account numbers, or other confidential information related to your identity. It is a violation of our[Terms of Use](http://www.californiapsychics.com/about/Terms-of-Service.aspx) for you to be in direct contact with any of our psychics outside the online service – if you do so, California Psychics bears no liability for any resulting actions, and your ability to use our services may be revoked.**

**How You Can Access or Correct Your Personal Information.**  
If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, or remove it by making the change on our [member account page](http://www.californiapsychics.com/) or by emailing our Customer Support at [Privacy@californiapsychics.com](mailto:Privacy@californiapsychics.com) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

**Information Security**

CaliforniaPsychics.com® is committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security. We are VeriSign secured and we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations and generally accepted standards to guard your nonpublic personal information, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Cookies**

To enhance your online experience with us, many of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files placed on your hard disk by our web server to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us. However, once you choose to provide the personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.  
We use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, to understand how our site is used, and to improve the content and offerings on our site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages or recall your specific information on subsequent visits (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our site). You can opt to have your browser reject cookies without any effect on your use of our site. If you do that, you may need to re-register with us every time you visit our site in order to participate in certain promotions. You should also know that companies that advertise on our web site (and their agents) might use their own cookies. This policy does not cover how these companies use their cookies.

Some of our Web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there to help us determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. 

**Clickstream Data.**  
As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to CaliforniaPsychics.com®. We may use clickstream data as a form of non-personally identifiable information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of CaliforniaPsychics.com®, how visitors navigate throughout the site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will only be used to improve our site. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregate. 

**Behavioral Targeting**

We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp), or visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

**YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

California Psychics collects various types of personal information about you, both online and offline, during the course of our business relationship. Under California law, if you are a resident of California, you may make a written request to California Psychics for information about how we have shared your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the prior calendar year, as well as a list of categories of information shared. For purposes of this California Privacy Rights notice, third parties include companies within our “family” of companies, such as those companies we own, that own us, or under common control with us. 

Under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its [Privacy Policy](http://www.californiapsychics.com/about/privacy-policy.aspx#top)) a policy of not disclosing customer personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and by providing a cost-free means to exercise that right. 

As stated in our [Privacy Policy](http://www.californiapsychics.com/about/privacy-policy.aspx#top), we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically by opting in to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask us to share your information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information. 

California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing [Privacy@californiapsychics.com](mailto:Privacy@californiapsychics.com). Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.
