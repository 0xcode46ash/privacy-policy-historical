# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Calculate Stuff we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.



### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Calculate Stuff collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Calculate Stuff’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Calculate Stuff’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Calculate Stuff may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Calculate Stuff also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Calculate Stuff only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Calculate Stuff’s websites choose to interact with Calculate Stuff in ways that require Calculate Stuff to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Calculate Stuff gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a widget to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with Calculate Stuff – by purchasing Pro Subscriptions, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Calculate Stuff collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Calculate Stuff. Calculate Stuff does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Calculate Stuff may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Calculate Stuff may monitor the most popular widgets. Calculate Stuff may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Calculate Stuff does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Calculate Stuff discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Calculate Stuff’s behalf or to provide services available at Calculate Stuff’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Calculate Stuff’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Calculate Stuff will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Calculate Stuff discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Calculate Stuff believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Calculate Stuff, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Calculate Stuff website and have supplied your email address, Calculate Stuff may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Calculate Stuff and our products. We primarily use our news section or social media accounts to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Calculate Stuff takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Calculate Stuff uses cookies to help Calculate Stuff identify and track visitors, their usage of Calculate Stuff website, and their website access preferences. Calculate Stuff visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Calculate Stuff’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Calculate Stuff’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Business Transfers

If Calculate Stuff, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Calculate Stuff goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Calculate Stuff may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

### Ads

Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Calculate Stuff and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Calculate Stuff may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Calculate Stuff’s sole discretion. Calculate Stuff encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
