# CA Privacy Notice

CA is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy and wants you to feel secure when visiting our site and providing information to us. In order to provide you with relevant information, respond to your requests, and increase the benefits you receive from our website, we sometimes request that you provide us with information about yourself.

We have prepared this Privacy Notice to inform you of the information we gather and how it is used. This Notice applies to all CA websites that display or link to this Privacy Notice. You should also note that CA maintains the same privacy practices with respect to data that is collected off-line and this notice may be relied upon with respect to those methods of data collection and use.

For personal information of individuals that CA receives from the European Economic Area (EEA), CA has committed to handling such personal information in accordance with the US Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Principles for transfer of personal information outside of the EEA. CA's Safe Harbor certification can be found at <http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webpages/safe+harbor+list>

 **What information do we gather?**  
In general, you may visit this website without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. CA collects domain information from your visit to customize and improve your experience on our website.

This website may collect certain information from your visit, including the date and time of your access, the pages you have accessed, the name of the Internet Service Provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address by which you are accessing the Internet, and the Internet address from which you linked to our site, if applicable. We use this information to better understand how our website is being used so that we can improve its quality and make it more beneficial to our users.

Some portions of this website may request that you give us information about yourself, from which we are able to identify you, such as your name, email or other address. Some of the ways in which we may collect information from you are:

  * Event registrations for webcasts, seminars, conferences, etc.
  * Product support registration
  * Education registration
  * Subscription to newsletters or other CA content-related notifications
  * Product purchases or trials
  * White paper or other downloads
  * Sweepstakes or contests



 **How do we use the information we gather?  
** When we collect information about you, it is our intention to tell you why we are asking for the information and what we intend to do with it. You will have the option of not providing the information, in which case you may still be able to access other portions of this website, although you may not be able to access certain programs or services. In certain areas of our website, we may, where appropriate, enable you to "opt out" of certain uses of your information, or elect not to receive future communications or services.

The information we collect about you or your computer will be used to operate our website and to provide customer support, respond to your requests or process any transactions you have authorized. It may also be used to verify your identity, send you information or contact you in relation to a CA product or service that you are using or that we believe may be of interest to you.

 **Will we share this information with third parties?  
** In certain instances, we may make your information available to third parties with whom we have a relationship where that third party is providing services on our behalf. We will only provide those third parties with information that is necessary for them to perform the services and we take measures to protect your information.

We may also disclose the information to our business partners, for marketing and other purposes which we believe may be beneficial to you.

CA is a global company with customers and partners in over 140 countries worldwide. Accordingly, the information we collect may be used, stored and processed in the United States or in any other country in which CA does business. By providing the information via the website, you are consenting to the transfer of the information outside of your country to any country (including countries which may not have adequate levels of protection).

CA may disclose information it has collected about you on the website if required to do so by law or when necessary in order to protect the rights of CA or its employees.

 **What about data security?**  
CA's intent is to strictly protect the security of your personal information; honor your choice for its intended use; and carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We have taken appropriate steps to safeguard and secure information we collect online, including the use of encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information.

However, you should always take into consideration that the internet is an open forum and that data may flow across networks with little or no security measures, and therefore such information may be accessed by people other than those you intended to access it.

 **Can you update and/or amend the personal information you have provided?  
** You are entitled to know whether we hold information about you and, if we do (subject to certain limitations), to have access to that information and have it corrected if it is inaccurate or out of date.

 **Business Relationships**  
This website contains links to other websites. CA is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

CA uses pixels, transparent GIF files and other methods to help manage online advertising. The GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With this technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. Visit [DoubleClick](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy) for more information, including information about how to opt out of these technologies.

 **Cookies and Web Beacons**  
CA uses third party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These third party companies employ cookie and web beacon (also referred to as 1x1 pixel.gifs or action tags) technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. Cookies are also used to help us track usage patterns in order to improve or manage our site, to ensure the integrity of the registration process, and to help provide personalized service and deliver content specific to your interests. A "cookie" is a small amount of data transferred to your browser and read by the Web server that placed it there. It works as a sort of identification card, recording your preferences and previously entered information. By using cookies, the information you previously provided can be retrieved on your next visit to the website so that your navigation time is reduced and your use of the website is simplified. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie. Web beacons may be used to deliver the cookie and to compile statistics about our website, such as how many people visited a particular page or clicked on certain links. While your particular use of the site will not be revealed and no personally identifying information will be collected, this anonymous information may be used for online preference marketing purposes, and CA's third party advertising companies may use the information about your visit to the website(s) in order to provide ads about goods and services of interest to you. This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown, related cookie, and the first three octets of the IP address. CA may share aggregated statistics about the use of the website with third parties.

You can set your browser to decline cookies if you prefer. If you do so, you may not be able to get the benefit of some of the features of this website or other websites that you visit.

 **Public Forums**  
Portions of this website make chat rooms, forums, blogs, message boards, and/or news groups available to visitors. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information.
