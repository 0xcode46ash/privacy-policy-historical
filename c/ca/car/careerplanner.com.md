# Privacy Policy and Credit Card Security

CareerPlanner.com promises to keep all information about our clients totally private. We have been doing business on the Web since 1998, and we have **never** sold our Email lists, nor any other client information. 

We hate SPAM as much as anyone and we value personal privacy. You can count on us to keep your information private.

This means that information about your education, your career, your test results, hobbies, phone numbers, Email address, postal address, and interests will be kept totally confidential.

We are here to help people plan, change or re-invent their careers. Our mission is to help people. It's that simple. 

## Information We Collect While You Are Visiting Our Site 

We collect normal "Web Statistics" as people visit our site. This is something almost all web sites do to improve the sites usability and reliability. Keeping a large web site running is a lot of work. 

This means that while you are on our site we will record this information into what is called log files:

  * The pages you visit
  * The time you spend on each page
  * The time and date you visited a page 
  * Your IP address
  * The URL of the site you were visiting before you came to us
  * The web browser you use



## Other Personal Information We May Collect

We collect different personal information, depending on what product or service you use.

#### **If you use our Career Interest Tests, we collect your:**

  * Email address
  * Billing address

  * 


#### Why Do We Collect Age / Date of Birth when you take tests and purchase reports? 

As of 2009, CareerPlanner.com has developed new technology that allows us to provide better career advice based on one's age. This is pretty amazing stuff that will really help our clients who are approaching 40 years of age and those approaching 50 and over.

## We Do Not Collect The Following Type Of Information 

We will not ask you for any of the following information which you might use elsewhere to protect your security on the web:

  * Social security number
  * Mother's maiden name 
  * City you were born in
  * Name of favorite pet



## Interest Based Advertising From Google and Others 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our web site. 

These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/pdfs/NAI_principles.pdf](http://www.networkadvertising.org/pdfs/NAI_principles.pdf)

**Regarding Google Ads on our site:**

  * Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site. 
  * Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet. 
  * Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 



Your credit card number is sent in encrypted form to our credit card processor. 

This means humans can not read it. It also means that if someone is intercepting your internet traffic the card number is scrambled. No one can read it except our credit card processing company. 

We use secure servers (SSL) and extra strong encryption.  On our site when you see the URL change from "http://" to "https:// "  all data transmission is encrypted so that other people snooping around the net can not read the data. 

We also employ a special security service which attempts to hack into our web site. They do this several times each day. If they find a new weakness they warn us and we are required to improve our security within 48 hours. 

Thus using your credit card on our site is very safe. In fact it is more safe than using your credit card at a restaurant or store where someone can easily write down all the information from your card. 

We have been accepting credit cards over the internet for more than 10 years. The only time a customer thought there was a problem was when someone else in their family made the purchase without telling them. 

As a final comfort, most credit card companies will drop a credit card charge if you tell them you never made the charge. They have to do this to stay in business.
