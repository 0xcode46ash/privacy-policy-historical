# Cartoon Network Australia | Free Games and Online Video from Ben 10, Gumball and Adventure Time!

Last updated: 9 June 2014

Thank you for visiting us. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this Privacy Policy, which sets out our online information handling practices and explains the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected and used by us. 

Turner Broadcasting System Asia Pacific, Inc. and its subsidiaries, affiliates and associated companies in Asia Pacific are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Cartoon Network," "we" or "us."

This Privacy Policy applies to personal information we collect on this website and other websites owned and operated by us from time to time, which as at the date of this Privacy Policy includes the websites listed [[here](https://web.archive.org/web/20141022182302id_/http%3A//www.cartoonnetwork.com.au/parents/ASPAC_Kids_websites.pdf)]( collectively, the "Sites"). It also applies to the personal information we collect from products and services we make available on various mobile devices or other platforms ("Apps"). This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other personal information collected by us through any other means. 

We are committed to providing fun, safe and secure Sites and Apps for people of all ages. Because many visitors to the Sites are children, we make efforts to minimise the chances of children accessing content that is not appropriate for them. In addition, we employ additional measures to help protect the privacy of children while online. We do not ask anyone to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in a particular activity. Also, in certain circumstances, you may be able to deal with us without identifying yourself (ie anonymously or by using a pseudonym), such as if you contact us by phone with a general enquiry. If you wish to do so, please contact us to find out if this is practicable in your circumstances

You do not have to provide us with your personal information. However, if you do not provide us with the information we require, we may not provide you with our products or services, including allowing you to leave comments on our forums or providing you with newsletters you request. 

By visiting our Sites, using our Apps or providing us with your personal information you agree to your personal information being collected, held, used and disclosed as set out in this Privacy Policy. 

**1\. The information we collect, how we collect it and why**

We collect your personal information in various ways directly from you (eg via our Sites or Apps) or from third parties (eg when your child or friend provides us with your information). We only use your personal information for the purpose for which it was provided to us (which is obvious at the time you provide it to us), other related purposes and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The types of personal information we usually collect and the reasons for our collection are explained in more detail below. 

You must not provide us with personal information about another person unless you have clear consent from that person to do so and you let them know about this Privacy Policy and where they can find it.

**Our Sites**

At Cartoon Network, we do not collect personally identifiable information on our Sites unless you voluntarily provide it to us when you visit our Sites, including when you participate in activities on our Sites (as described below) and when you provide information to our customer service representatives.

  1. For online polls or surveys: we may ask visitors to provide information that is not likely to personally identify you. This might include first name only, city or state of residence, age, gender, or a favorite cartoon character. 
  2. For sweepstakes and competitions: we may ask visitors to provide a first name and e-mail address. We do not continue to retain or use any personal information we obtain through a contest or sweepstakes after we have successfully selected a winner(s), awarded the prize(s), and administered the contest or sweepstakes, except to the extent it is necessary to keep winner's details for record keeping purposes. 
  3. For e-mail newsletters, postcards and special offers: we may collect and use personal information (such as name and e-mail address) to send e-mail newsletters and e-mail or direct mail notification of special offers, sale events, or birthday reminders, but only if you have requested to receive them. We will only provide our newsletters and marketing information to a child under 14 years of age with consent from their parent or guardian. These communications include instructions for subscription removal via return e-mail. We may also ask for personal information about other people for activities such as sending an electronic postcard or e-mail to a friend. This is usually limited to a first name and e-mail address. E-mail addresses collected to send an electronic postcard or e-mail to a friend are deleted immediately when the requested postcard or e-mail is transmitted. 
  4. For campaigns or offers for parents/adults: we may ask a parent or adult to provide their name, address, e-mail, telephone and fax number and/or information about their interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. 
  5. For customer service and improving our Sites and products: we may ask visitors to provide a first name, email address and limited information that is relevant to a customer service inquiry in order to provide appropriate customer service support or improve our Sites or products.
  6. For ordering merchandise or virtual items and participating in certain interactive features: we may ask visitors to provide their full name, billing and mailing addresses, e-mail , telephone number, and the recipient's name and mailing address (if they are not the visitor). Purchases are managed by external payment providers who will ask for credit card information (which is never passed on to Cartoon Network). 
  7. For notification of parents re collection from children under the age of 14: When a child under the age of 14 participates in an activity on a Site that requires provision of personal information, we will ask for the child's e-mail address, which will not be stored in a retrievable form but instead using a "hash" or unique code generated from the e-mail address that will allow us on a one-time basis, for example, to respond to an inquiry from the child regarding a lost user name or password. We will also ask for a parent's e-mail address to notify them that we have received personal information from their child and allow them to remove their child's name from our lists. If you are a parent or guardian that has become aware that your child has provided Cartoon Network with any personally identifiable information your consent, please contact us at privacyasiapac@turner.com so we can delete such information.
  8. For specific one time requests: we may ask visitors to provide their e-mail addresses, which are collected and used only in connection with the specific one-time request. For example, for sweepstakes and contests, e-mail addresses are collected for the purpose of conducting the online sweepstakes or contest and notifying the winners on a one-time basis. 
  9. For activities requiring registration: we may ask users to provide certain information that is not personally identifiable such as city or state of residence, date of birth and gender. For individuals who are the age of 14 and over, we may also collect and store an e-mail address to use in the case of forgotten passwords. For children under the age of 14, please see section 1(g) above.
  10. For non-personally identifiable information: during your visit to our Sites, we also may collect some non-personally identifiable information such as the current Internet protocol address and the type of computer operating system you are using (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), the type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the domain name of the Internet service provider (e.g., Hotmail, Yahoo), your activities while visiting our Sites, your activities while playing games or utilizing services on our Sites (e.g., which of our Web pages you viewed or which games you played), and the advertisements you have been shown.



**Our Apps**

Cartoon Network does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 14 in our Apps. The data collected in an App may vary by App but will include any information a user provides once the user downloads and uses the App. For example, some Apps may require you to register by creating an account with us before you can use it so we may ask for information such as you user name, password, or email address. Other Apps may require additional information from you, such as transaction-related information (e.g. when you make purchases, respond to any offers). We may also use information you provide us to reach you when you contact us for help. If you interact with third-party social media sites and applications, we may have access to certain information from your social media account such as your user name, profile picture, information about friends and followers, and content posted or viewed through the social media. When you use social media networking platforms and plugins, you share your information with them and their use of your information will be subject to that social media site's privacy practices. To help improve the design, functionality, performance and content of our Apps, we usually collect certain information when you use the App on your mobile device, such as usage, viewing and technical data including the type of mobile device you use, your unique device ID, your device's IP address, your mobile operator and operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use the App. Our Apps usually do not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device and only would do so if you are specifically prompted to provide your consent to do so. You can always manage your location preferences at any time by adjusting the settings on your device. 

**Aggregating information**

We may on occasion combine information we collect through our Sites and Apps with information that we collect from other sources in a way that is no longer capable of personally identifying an individual. We sometimes use this non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our Sites and Apps and to improve our visitors' experience on the Sites and Apps. We also may aggregate, use and share this non-personally identifiable information with third parties to analyze Site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services.

**2\. How we disclose the information we collect**

The personal information you provide to us may be shared, if appropriate, with any of our related entities, affiliates, agents and third parties who provide services on our behalf. These include:

  * Any of the companies within our group and our other subsidiaries, affiliates and associated companies around the world. 
  * Our agents or contractors to provide services on our behalf, such as helping us conduct a sweepstakes, sending prizes to winners, shipping customer orders made on the Sites, processing payments, or providing customer service related to activities on the Sites. We require our agents and contractors to keep the personal information we provide to them confidential and to use it only for the specific services they are performing for us. 
  * Our third party information technology, infrastructure and operations service providers (eg cloud storage providers), consultants and advisers. 
  * Organisations and government agencies if required in response to legal process (for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena) or a law enforcement agency's request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Sites and Apps and applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. 
  * If we or one of our business units are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another entity, to that entity and their advisers.
  * Any other entities notified to you at the time we collect your personal information.



We will not use or disclose personally identifiable information in ways that are materially different from the ones described above without notifying you and, if required, obtaining your consent. If you are under the age of 14, we will also provide parental notification of any material changes to our practices.

**3\. Cookies and web beacons**

To enhance your online experience, our Sites use a software technology called "cookies" or similar technologies. Cookies are small text files placed in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. We do not use cookies in connection with personal information with one exception: for some activities, we use session cookies to ensure that visitors under the age of 14 provide a parental email address. We do use cookies to determine how many visitors we have and how often they visit various sections of our Sites and to improve or customize the content, offerings and/or advertisements on our Sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Sites (e.g., to recognize you by your user name when you return to a Site), and to enable use of shopping carts on our Sites.

We, our third party service providers and/or our partners also may use cookies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Sites and Apps. This also helps us, our service providers and partners provide more relevant advertising. For more information regarding third-party ad servers, see "Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites," below.

"Web beacons" or clear .gifs or similar technologies are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We, our third party service providers and/or our partners may use web beacons on our Sites or Apps from time to time for this and other purposes.

You can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies. Blocking all cookies may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered at our Sites. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information.

**4\. Collection of information by third-party sites, ad servers and sponsors**

Our Sites and Apps contain links to other Web sites, including those of sponsors and advertisers, whose information practices may be different from ours. Sometimes these third party Web sites might conduct contests or sweepstakes that are promoted on our Sites. Visitors should consult those other third party Web sites' privacy notices, since those Web sites are not covered by our Privacy Policy and may follow different procedures.

Additionally, we and our advertisers may use third parties to serve or present the ads that appear on our Site and Apps and to conduct research about the advertisements. These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third party service providers and/or partners may also place cookies, web beacons, clear .gifs or similar technologies and collect data to help present such advertisements on our Sites and our Apps, and to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. For more information about third-party ad servers and your ability to opt-out of targeted advertising from such third party ad servers generally, please see <http://www.networkadvertising.org/>.

**5\. International Transfer**

Turner operates globally so it may be necessary to transfer any information provided to these Sites or Apps internationally. In particular, the information provided will likely be disclosed to, processed, stored and maintained by our affiliates or third party partners in Hong Kong, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom where many of our central databases and third party partners operate. The data protection and other laws of other countries may not be as comprehensive as those in your country. 

Please be assured that we take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. However, if you are in Australia, you acknowledge that, by agreeing to the disclosure of your personal information to these entities outside of Australia, we will no longer be required to take reasonable steps to ensure the overseas recipient's compliance with the Australian privacy law and will not be liable to you for any breach of the Australian privacy law by these overseas recipients. On this basis, by using our Sites and our Apps, you consent to your information being disclosed to overseas recipients as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

**6\. Security**

We have put in place reasonable physical and electronic security measures and managerial procedures in an effort to safeguard the personal information we hold and help protect your personal information from misuse, interference and loss and from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.

However, data protection and security measures are never completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. You must take care to protect your personal information (for example, by protecting any usernames and passwords) and notify us as soon as possible if you become aware of any security breaches.

Please note that some or all of your personal information may be required in order for a Site or App to function properly, and we may be required to retain certain information by law.
