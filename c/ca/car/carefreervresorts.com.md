# Privacy Statement

Thank you for visiting the Sun Communities website. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used on this website.

## The Information We Collect

You may express an opinion, contact us online to ask for a brochure or to obtain more information. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address and telephone number.

## How We Use the Information

We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our resorts, and to respond to your inquiries.

We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when we have fulfilled an online request, or to contact you about resort information.

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.

Finally, Sun Communities will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.

### Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors

The website may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

## Cookies

Although we don't use "cookies" to personally identify you, we may use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites.

Cookies are text files that may be placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information.
