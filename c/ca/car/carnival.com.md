**Affiliate Marketing Opt Out**  
Federal law gives you the right to limit some but not all marketing from Carnival. Federal law also requires us to give you this notice to tell you about your choice to limit marketing from Carnival. 

You may limit our affiliates, including our sister cruise lines in the Carnival Corporation, from marketing their products or services to you based on personal information Carnival provides them. This information includes your name, your address, and your cruising history.

Your choice to limit marketing offers will apply for 5 years from when you tell us your choice. Once that period expires, you may receive a renewal notice which will allow you to limit marketing offers for another 5 years. If you have already made a choice to limit marketing offers from us, you do not need to act again until you receive the renewal notice. To limit affiliate marketing offers, please email: [privacypolicy@carnival.com](mailto:privacypolicy@carnival.com) or contact us toll free at **1-888-CARNIVAL.**

**Your California Privacy Rights**  
Carnival may disclose your personal information to our affiliates or other third parties for their use in the marketing of their products or services (as opposed to Carnival products or services) to you unless you tell us not to.

**Transportation Security Administration Secure Flight Notice**

If you book commercial air travel within, into or out of the United States in conjunction with your voyage we will request this information from you and forward it to the TSA as required by law.

**Security Procedures to Protect Information**  
Security of personal information is extremely important to us. Carnival employs security measures consistent with standard industry practice to prevent unauthorized access to your personal information collected on and used by Carnival at this site. Our site uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) security technology to encrypt information you provide to us through the Site, but any information you provide us by email is unencrypted. SSL is an industry-standard protocol for encryption over the internet. Data transmission over the internet is never 100% secure.

While we take steps to protect your personal information and keep it secure, you also play a role in protecting your information. You can help to maintain the security of your online transactions by not sharing your booking number or password with anyone. Carnival cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our site, and therefore you use our site at your own risk.

Carnival's site may contain links to other sites such as our affiliates and third parties. This Privacy Policy only addresses Carnival's use and disclosure of your information collected on this site, if any. While we try to link only to sites that share our standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of our affiliates or any other third parties or the content of linked sites, although we do encourage you to read the applicable privacy policies and terms and conditions of such parties or web sites.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**  
We will occasionally amend this Privacy Policy to reflect company and customer feedback and we reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. The use of your information is subject to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use in effect at the time of use. The provisions contained in this Privacy Policy supersede all previous notices or policies regarding our privacy practices with respect to this site. We post the effective date of our Privacy Policy on our site. We encourage you to check our site frequently to see the current Privacy Policy to be informed of how Carnival is committed to protecting your information and providing you with improved content on our website in order to enhance your online cruise planning experience. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy we will post the revised Privacy Policy and the revised effective date on this site.
