# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how Cardinal Health, Inc. (“Cardinal Health”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects and uses your information.

Our Privacy Policy applies to all who visit and use our website, CardinalHealth.com, and online services as well as the websites and online services offered by our affiliates, including Cordis.com (collectively the “Site”). Affiliates are those entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Cardinal Health, or that are controlled by or under common control with Cardinal Health.

This Privacy Policy excludes those websites and online services operated by Cardinal Health or our affiliates that have separate privacy policies and do not incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference or otherwise. Different privacy policies may also apply to other parts of Cardinal Health’s web presence – for example, password protected areas or web pages for online recruitment. Please note that our Privacy Policy applies only to activities we engage in on the Site and does not apply to activities that are "offline" or unrelated to the Site. 

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/en/support/terms-and-conditions-english.html), which also apply when you use our Site.  By using the Site, you agree to the terms in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the practices described in this Privacy Policy, please do not provide us with your personal information or otherwise interact with the Site. 

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will provide notice on this Site prior to the changes becoming effective. You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the date it was “last updated” above. 

We encourage you to periodically review the privacy policy for any modifications.

**Information Collection:  **We may collect some or all of the following information from you when you visit and interact with our Site:

  * _Personal Information that you voluntarily provide to us_. “Personal Information” is information about you that specifically identifies you or, when combined with other information we have, can be used to identify you. It includes such things as name, address, company name, occupational role, telephone number, fax number, email address, date of birth, and purchase and ordering history.
  * _Non-identifying information we collect when you use the Site_. “Non-identifying information” is information that alone cannot identify you and has not been associated with you.  It includes such things as data from cookies or pixel tags, or data about the device you use to access, use, or interact with our Site, such as your IP address or the type of browser you are using.

Any information we receive through third party social media services may be used as described in this policy.

We may use cookies, web beacons/pixel tags, and other technology (collectively “cookies”) to collect anonymous, non-identifying information about you when you visit our Site or interact with our emails. “Cookies” are small bits of data cached or stored on your computer based on Internet activity.  These cookies may be delivered in a first party or third party context. For example, we may collect information about your browser type and version, operating system, user language, ISP, viewed web pages, links that are clicked, IP address, the presence or absence of “flash” plugs-ins, screen resolution, connection type, sites visited before and after visiting our Site, details about items purchased, and emails we send that you open, forward, or click through to our Site.

It is possible that one or more of our websites that link to the Privacy Policy utilize Flash cookies, otherwise known as local shared objects, to store your preferences or display personalized content based upon what you view on our Site. “Flash cookies” use technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than your browser and are not disabled from your normal browser settings. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. Please see the last section under Cookies and Tracking for information on how to disable Flash cookies.

By collecting this non-identifying information we can better understand how you interact with our Site; give you a more personal and optimized online experience by tracking your preferences; improve our Site; fulfill contracts with our business partners; help confirm receipt of and response to our emails; and provide more effective customer service. We also use this information for the same purpose as your Personal Information.

Access to your Personal Information is limited by need. Only a restricted number of Cardinal Health employees, and individuals and entities with whom Cardinal Health contracts to carry out business will have access to your Personal Information for the purposes described above. 

We do not provide your Personal Information to any third party for their own direct marketing purposes. Our third party advertising partners may, however, may use cookies to collect non-identifying information about your visit to our Site and other sites. These advertisers collect non-identifying information in order to, among other things, deliver ads that are targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visits to our Site and other websites tracked by these third parties. This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection methods or use of the information collected by third party advertisers, and Cardinal Health is not responsible for cookies in third party ads. We encourage you to review the privacy policies or statements of these third party advertising companies to learn more about their use of cookies and other similar technologies.

However, our Site may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us, such as social networking sites, interactive maps that provide directions to retailers that carry our products or services, and links to retailers’ sites and e-commerce sites that sell our products or services. The Privacy Policy does not address nor do we control or have responsibility for the policies or practices of any third parties or any third-party sites to which this Site links. If you provide any information to such third parties, different rules regarding the collection and use of your personal information may apply.  We strongly suggest you review such third party's privacy policies before providing any data to them. These other sites may send their own cookies or clear GIFs to users, collect data or solicit personal information.  We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these entities directly if you have any questions about their privacy practices.

Cardinal Health takes appropriate steps to manage the privacy of your Personal Information and the security of the Site. We have implemented commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls that are designed to safeguard Personal Information.  Still, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
