## About the figures and diagrams in our job information

We consider:

  * Careers New Zealand research, including interviews with people involved with training, industry bodies, and employers.

Most job numbers are estimates only. 

Unless indicated in source information, data is based on detailed employment estimates developed by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, using information from Statistics New Zealand’s:

  * Linked Employer-Employee Data
  * Household Labour Force Survey. 



If we have used another source, this is shown below the job numbers.

#### "Current vacancies" information and job vacancies map
