###  About the figures and diagrams in our job information 

### Pay information

Pay information is provided as a guide only. People's individual pay rates may vary according to their skills, experience and qualifications and their employer.

Sources we use may include:

  * published data on pay rates, such as Multi-Employer Collective Agreements
  * Statistics New Zealand’s population Census data
  * minimum pay rates published by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment
  * surveys carried out within occupations or by recruitment firms
  * pay information in job advertisements on job vacancy websites
  * interviews with people involved with training, industry bodies, and employers.



Pay ranges based on Census information use the lower and upper quartile earnings for the occupation.

### Information in the "Job opportunities" section

#### Chances gauge

The chances gauge shows our estimate of the demand for staff in a particular occupation, as at the last updated date (indicated by the information in the outlook sources section).

We consider:

  * whether job numbers are growing or shrinking
  * how much staff turnover there is in an occupation
  * whether the occupation is on a skills shortage list
  * how the supply of graduates or trainees compares with the demand for workers
  * Careers New Zealand research, including interviews with people involved with training, industry bodies, and employers.



#### "How many people are doing this job?" infographic numbers

Most job numbers are estimates only. 

Unless indicated in source information, data is based on detailed employment estimates developed by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, using information from Statistics New Zealand’s:

  * Linked Employer-Employee Data
  * Household Labour Force Survey. 



If we have used another source, this is shown below the job numbers.

#### "Current vacancies" information and job vacancies map

Information in the "Current vacancies" section, and the "Job vacancies by region" map is drawn from Trade Me Jobs.

A number of jobs, such as some medical jobs, are only advertised on specialist job vacancy sites.

We value your comments and opinions. If you have comments, questions or complaints about any of our services or website policies please contact Careers New Zealand.
