By installing, accessing or using the Services, You expressly consent to the collection, processing and use of Your personal information according to this Privacy Policy. 

### HOW CARBONITE USES INFORMATION

**Personal Information.** Carbonite collects personal information relevant to Your subscription with Carbonite, including Your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information and certain non-personally identifiable information from Your computer that reflects Your use and configuration of Carbonite, including, without limitation, statistics relating to how often backups are started and completed, performance metrics and configuration settings. This information collected will be sent to Carbonite and may be used by Carbonite without restriction.

**Cookies and Other Technologies.** Carbonite uses “cookies” and other technologies to collect data that enables us to better understand and improve the usability, performance and effectiveness of our website. Cookies are files sent to Your browser and stored on Your computer. If You do not want Carbonite to send cookies to Your browser, You can set Your browser options to reject cookies or notify You when a website tries to put a cookie into Your browser. Rejecting cookies may affect Your ability to use some features of the Services. 

Carbonite gathers general information about visits to our website, the files You have marked for backup, the configuration of Your computer and Your computer’s interaction with Carbonite. Carbonite uses this information to provide the Services, understand traffic and downloads on our website, provide You with technical support, improve the website and provide the best online experience possible for our customers. 

**Use of Your Personal Information.** Carbonite will not sell Your personal information to third parties. Carbonite may, from time to time, share with You information about other services that we think You may find to be of interest. If You wish to change the types of communications You receive from us, You may do so by clicking on the appropriate “Manage Communications” link in Carbonite’s e-mail communications to You or by e-mailing Your request to Carbonite at [customersupport@carbonite.com](mailto:customersupport@carbonite.com).

Carbonite will not view the contents of Your Account. Carbonite may view Your file system information (file folder names, file extensions, sizes etc., but not Your file contents) to provide incremental backups and file comparisons, quality control and technical support. Carbonite will not disclose Your personal information, including the contents of Your Account, to third parties unless disclosure is necessary to comply with the law.
