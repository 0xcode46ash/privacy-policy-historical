# Privacy Policy | Carbonite

This Privacy Policy is subject to and incorporated into the End User License Agreement (the "Terms") between you and Carbonite. You may access The Terms by navigating to the "Terms" link to the left or by clicking [Terms](https://web.archive.org/en/terms-of-use/terms). Capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy without definition have the meaning given to them in the Terms. By agreeing to the Terms and using, installing, or accessing the Carbonite Products, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy and the terms contained herein.

This Privacy Policy applies to Carbonite's collection and use of personally identifying information that Carbonite may gather when you contact us, visit our web site, or purchase, license, or use the Carbonite Products. By installing, accessing, or using the Carbonite Products, you expressly consent to the collection, processing and use of your personal information according to this Privacy Policy. 

### How Carbonite Uses Information

**Personal Information.** Carbonite collects personal information relevant to your transaction with Carbonite, including your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information and certain non-personally identifiable information from your computer that reflects your use and configuration of Carbonite, including, without limitation, statistics relating to how often backups are started and completed, performance metrics relating to the Software, and configuration settings. This information collected will be sent to Carbonite and may be used by Carbonite without restriction. 

**Cookies and Other Technologies.** Carbonite uses "cookies" and other technologies to collect data that enables us to better understand and improve the usability, performance and effectiveness of our web site. Cookies are files sent to your browser and stored on your computer. If you do not want Carbonite to send cookies to your browser, you can set your browser options to reject cookies or notify you when a web site tries to put a cookie into your browser software. Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use some features of the Carbonite Products. 

Carbonite gathers general information about visits to our web site, the files you have marked for backup, the configuration of your computer and your computer's interaction with Carbonite. Carbonite uses this information to provide the service, understand traffic and downloads on our web site, provide you with technical support, improve the web site, and provide the best online experience possible for our customers. 

**Use of Your Personal Information.** Carbonite will not sell your personal information to third parties. Carbonite may, from time to time, share with you information about other products and services that we think you may find to be of interest. If you wish to change the types of communications you receive from us, you may do so by clicking on the appropriate "Manage Communications" link in Carbonite's email communications to you or by emailing your request to Carbonite at [customersupport@carbonite.com](mailto:customersupport@carbonite.com). Please note that opting-out of receiving promotional email will not affect receipt of service-related, transactional, or legal communication via email in accordance with the [Terms](https://web.archive.org/en/terms-of-use/terms).

Carbonite will not view the contents of your backed-up files. Carbonite may view your file system information (file and/or folder names, file extensions, sizes etc. but not your file contents) to provide incremental backups and file comparisons, quality control, and technical support. Carbonite will not disclose your personal information, including the contents of your backed-up data with Carbonite, to third parties unless disclosure is necessary to comply with law.

**How You Can Access Or Correct Your Personal Information.** You can update your personal information by accessing the password-protected, web-based Carbonite administrative console by supplying your valid login credentials or emailing Carbonite at [privacy@carbonite.com](mailto:privacy@carbonite.com).

Carbonite does not intend to collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13 years old or knowingly distribute such information. Children under 13 are not permitted to use Carbonite's web site, and we request that children under 13 not submit any personally identifiable information to Carbonite. If a child under 13 has provided Carbonite with personally identifiable information, the parent or guardian of that child should contact Carbonite immediately at [privacy@carbonite.com](mailto:privacy@carbonite.com) to delete this information from our files.
