##### Security for Your Personal Information

Carbonite has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your Personal Information in our customer database. Personal Information provided to Carbonite is stored in secure facilities with access restricted to authorized personnel only. Although we make good faith efforts to store the Personal Information we collect in a secure operating environment that is not accessible to unauthorized users, we cannot guarantee complete security.

To provide secure credit card processing when ordering from us, orders placed on our Website are processed through a payment gateway which operates under its own privacy policy. If you choose to purchase or license Carbonite Products or Services online using a credit card, the credit card information is sent to Carbonite using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, an industry-standard method for protecting data as it travels over the Internet, or a similar encryption technology that may become accepted as an industry standard or better encryption method, in the future ("Transmission Encryption"). To learn more about our credit card processing vendors and their respective privacy and other policies (which are incorporated by reference into the Carbonite Privacy Policy and Terms or Use by reference) email us at [customersupport@carbonite.com](mailto:customersupport@carbonite.com "customersupport@carbonite.com").

Carbonite encrypts the files that we process before they leave your computer. Carbonite uses SSL or similar Transmission Encryption technology before sending your files to our data centers. Your encrypted backup files transmitted to our servers are stored in facilities with access restricted to authorized personnel only. Carbonite does not encrypt the file names or file type information.

By Using the Carbonite Product that permits you to download your backed up files to any computer that has a connection to the Internet you understand that Carbonite will be decrypting these files before they leave Carbonite's servers and that once decrypted these files can be reviewed by anyone who may be able to access them.

Carbonite will not decrypt your files unless i) it reasonably believes that it must do so to troubleshoot problems with the Carbonite Products or Services or ii) it reasonably believes it must do so in order to comply with a law, subpoena, warrant, order, or a certification requirement, such as the requirements of 18 U.S.C. ยง 2703. 

However, if you elect to Use Carbonite Products or Services that permit you to access Backup Data from an Internet enabled computer other than by using Carbonite Software on your registered computer, then your Backup Data will be decrypted by Carbonite in its data center and sent to you in a decrypted form via public infrastructure. You election to use such products or services may make the contents of these files to accessible to individuals or entities other than you and those you intend. By using such products and services, you knowingly accept this risk.

Where Carbonite collects Personal Information directly from individuals in the EEA, we will inform them about the purposes for which we collect and use their Personal Information, the types of non-agent third parties to which Carbonite may disclose that information, and the choices and means, if any, Carbonite offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information to Carbonite, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before Carbonite uses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected. 

2\. **CHOICE**. Where Carbonite collects Personal Information directly from individuals in the EEA, Carbonite will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their Personal Information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For Sensitive Personal Information, Carbonite will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Carbonite will provide individuals with commercially reasonable mechanisms to exercise their choices. 

3\. **ONWARD TRANSFERS TO AGENTS**. Carbonite will obtain assurances from its agents that they will safeguard Personal Information through measures consistent with this Privacy Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, the agent registering to participate in the Safe Harbor mechanism, or another method of assurance deemed adequate by the European Commission. Where Carbonite has knowledge that an agent is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner contrary to this Privacy Policy, Carbonite will take commercially reasonable steps to prevent or stop the unauthorized use or disclosure. 

4\. **SECURITY**. Carbonite will take commercially reasonable steps to protect Personal Information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. 

5\. **DATA INTEGRITY**. Carbonite will use Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Carbonite will take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current to the extent appropriate for its intended use. 

6\. **ACCESS**. Upon request, Carbonite will grant individuals commercially reasonable access to Personal Information that it holds about them. In addition, Carbonite will take commercially reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. 

7\. **ENFORCEMENT**. Carbonite will conduct compliance audits of its practices to verify adherence to this Privacy Policy. Any employee that Carbonite determines is in violation of this Privacy Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of Personal Information should be directed to Carbonite at the address given below. Carbonite will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with the principles contained in this Privacy Policy.

##### Severability

This Privacy Policy shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. If for any reason any provision of this Privacy Policy is held to be invalid or unenforceable to any extent under applicable law, then (i) such provision will be interpreted, construed, or reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable, and consistent with the original intent underlying such provision and (ii) such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Privacy Policy and all such provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
