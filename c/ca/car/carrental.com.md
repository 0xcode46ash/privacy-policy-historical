What Personally Identifiable Information Avis Collects and How it is Collected

When you make a reservation, rent a car and/or join one of Avis' programs, we need to collect certain information about you in order to provide and improve our services. The service that you chose will determine what information we collect from you. This information may include, but not be limited to: 

Name

Email Address

Home and/or Business Address

Telephone Numbers at which we can contact you

Your Date of Birth

Method of Payments (credit card and expiration date)

Driver's License and Province/Country of Issuance 


When you rent a vehicle, we will also record information that details your rental (e.g. where you rented the vehicle, where and when you returned the vehicle, payment arrangements, insurance preferences, gas consumption, mileage and other information related to the vehicle).

We may also need certain information from you when you request any of the following services or equipment: Special Needs/Optional Equipment; Special Offers/Discounts; Partner Member Numbers; use of an Avis Worldwide Discount Number and other car preferences. For example, if you wish to use a discount that Avis provides to members of an association/affiliate to which you belong, we may collect information about your membership to verify and provide you with the correct discount for our services.

How we collect this information will depend on how you use our services. We may collect this information directly from you by telephone, fax, email, at the counter, upon completion of an application or enrollment form, or through your use of our Site or the Internet. To the extent you use our Site, we may also collect information about your use of our Site, transactional and account information, e-mail and other information related to communications to our Site. We may also collect information about you indirectly through a travel agent, an account program in which you or your employer participates or through one of our partner programs when you deal with us through those means. Additionally, our affiliates and third parties may provide us with information about you.

You may choose not to provide some of your PII to us, but this may prevent us from providing our services to you, or limit our ability to provide you with the level of service that you would otherwise expect from us.

How Personally Identifiable Information is Used and Disclosed by Avis

_Usage_

We strive to ensure that we give you a stress-free rental experience and are dedicated to building a rewarding and lasting relationship with every customer. In order to provide the level of service we believe you expect from us, we may use your PII for the following purposes: 

To provide the services and offerings that you request, and to communicate with you regarding such services and offerings;

To do all things necessary to administer those services;

To research, develop, manage, protect and improve our Site and services;

To maintain and develop our service-oriented software and other business systems; and

To analyze data, or to have a third party do so on our behalf. 


We also use your PII information or some discrete part such as your email address for other purposes. For example, such information may be used to process and track your transactions and to send you information about our and our affiliates' and business partners' products and services and other information and materials that may be of interest to you. If you use our Site, information may also be used to evaluate what portions of our Site are visited more often than others, determine where visitors came from, where they go, and how long they stay on a particular page, or on our Site in general.

We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including, for example, information collected online and offline, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including third parties. To do this, it is often necessary to share this information with carefully selected vendors and business partners we work with, such as companies that manage accounts, offer affinity, frequent-user, and reward programs, and companies that perform marketing services and other business operations for us. See below under Disclosing.

_Disclosing_

We may disclose your PII to affiliated and non-affiliated organizations including, for example: 

To your company or organization if you use our services under a corporate or other commercial account;

To one of our program partners (e.g. if you are a member of a frequent traveler program and you have asked us to send details of your rental agreement with us to obtain your benefits from that program);

To entities that provide services on our behalf;

To your credit card issuer;

To credit reporting and fraud checking agencies;

To debt collection agencies, if you fail to pay monies owed to us;

To government or private organizations responsible for the processing or handling of traffic or parking related violations;

To driver licensing authorities, directly or through intermediary organizations, when needed to verify compliance with Avis' safe driver criteria for qualified drivers and/or to verify license information; and

To government, regulatory and law enforcement agencies where the disclosure is required or authorized by law, and otherwise as we believe is necessary or appropriate to satisfy any law, regulation or other governmental request, to operate our Site properly, or to protect or defend our rights or the rights or well-being of our employees, users or others or if you are involved (or are suspected by governmental authorities or our security functions to be involved) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order. 


We may also disclose your information to our affiliates and non-affiliated business partners for their use both on our behalf and for their own business purposes. For example, our affiliates and business partners may use such information to send you information about their products and services and other information and materials that may be of interest to you. You may opt-out of us disclosing your PII for these purposes through one of the methods described in this policy.

We may also share your information with other non-affiliated third parties, such as entities that provide services for or through our Site or for our business (e.g., advertisers, ad servers, content providers, services providers, credit card processors, fulfillment services providers, e-mail list hosting companies and distribution companies) that use such information on our behalf consistent with this Privacy Policy. These types of third parties are not permitted to use your information for any secondary purposes.

We may also transfer or assign your information to third parties as a result of or in connection with a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of assets, reorganization or liquidation. For more information see our sections below on changes in the use of your PII.

Licensees

Some Avis locations are owned and operated by an independent licensee that is neither owned nor controlled by Avis Budget Group, Avis or any other Avis Budget Group subsidiary. Each licensee collects PII and uses the PII for its own purposes. Avis does not control the use of this information or access to the information by the licensee and its associates. The licensee is the merchant who collects and processes credit card information and receives payment for the car rental services. The licensee is subject to the merchant rules of the credit card processors it selects, which establish its card security rules and procedures. This policy does not apply to a licensee's web site. Licensees may also use email campaigns and other methods of telephone, electronic, and direct mail solicitation without our consent or knowledge and are solely responsible for their content and methods of identifying and contacting addressees.

Web Site and Internet Privacy

If you use our Site or otherwise interact with us via the Internet, the following privacy-related policies also apply:

Web Site Tracking and the Use of Cookies and Other Technologies

If you use our Site, certain PII may be collected in the course of your use of our Site. As with many web sites, we may use both session based and persistent "cookies" and/or other technology (e.g., web bugs, e-mail bugs, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracker GIFs and :clickstream" data logs) in our Site and other web sites, or in our electronic communications with you, to enhance the functionality of our Site and services and to make your transactions and other activities more convenient and efficient. These technologies may vary, but in many cases may involve a small file stored locally on the computer used to access our Site (commonly referred to as a 'cookie'), and may be used to store and collect information relating to your viewing and use of our Site and our correspondences with you. We use cookies to track web site trends and patterns. This helps us understand our users needs better and improve areas of our Site. We store information we collect through cookies to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information we keep on individual users that details their travel preferences, rental history and behavioral activity, and to minimize the need for you to re-enter information on our Site. Consequently, collected information is tied to a user's PII to provide offers and improve our services and content within our Site.

Most cookies expire after a defined period of time, or you can delete your cookie file at any time. Most web browser software is initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser software to refuse cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some parts of our Site will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences, and/or may have difficulty completing transactions.

We may collect your computer's IP (Internet Protocol) address and domain name address, the identity of your Internet service or access provider, the type of web browsing software you use, your computer's operating system, the URL of the web page from which you came to visit our Site and the language you selected for your web browsing software (collectively referred to herein as "clickstream data"). We use these technologies, for example, to identify our users, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer and promote our and our affiliates' and business partners' web sites and services.

Third parties (including, but not limited to, software vendors, advertisers, ad servers, content providers and services providers) may also use similar technologies by or through our Site or third party web sites. In connection therewith, such entities may collect information about you and your usage activity on this and other web sites. We have no responsibility with respect to what information such third parties track or collect, or for any tracking, data collection or other activities of such third parties. Please check their terms of use and privacy policies for such information.

We may use third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, or similar technology which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

Web Beacons

Web pages may contain an electronic file called a web beacon that allows a web site to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies. We are partnering with Yahoo! who utilizes web beacons in the following ways: 

  * Yahoo! uses web beacons to conduct research on behalf of certain partners on their web sites and also for auditing purposes.
  * Information recorded through these web beacons is used to report aggregate information about Yahoo! users to our partners. This aggregate information may include demographic and usage information. No personally identifiable information about you is shared with partners from this research.
  * When conducting research, Yahoo!'s practice is to require our partners to disclose the presence of these web beacons on their pages in their privacy policies and state what choices are available to users regarding the collection and use of this information. You may choose to [opt-out of Yahoo!](http://pclick.yahoo.com/p?optout) using this information for this research.

Note: This opt-out applies to a specific browser rather than a specific user. Therefore you will have to opt-out separately from each computer or browser that you use. Links to Other Web Sites

Our Site may contain links or references to other web sites outside of our control, and the privacy policies of these sites may differ from our own. Please be aware that we have no control over such web sites and our privacy policy does not apply to such web sites. We advise you to check the privacy policies of such sites before disclosing any PII via such sites.

Framing

Occasionally when linking to another site from avis.com, you may still see Avis' logo or an avis.com frame. The reason for this is, to provide you with a seamless experience when visiting our web site. In these cases, you are no longer on avis.com but will now be on a different web site, not owned or controlled by Avis and therefore the information collection practices of the third party's site may differ from Avis'. The privacy policy of a third party site will govern how information collected from you is used by the owner of the site. You can always know what site you are on by checking the location bar within your browser.

How We Protect the Security of Personally Identifiable Information

The security of your PII is an important concern to us. We exercise reasonable care in implementing generally accepted standards of technology security in order to protect information collected via our Site from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption for some of your more sensitive PII.

Unfortunately, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, and no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee that any information stored on our servers, or transmitted to or from a user, will be free from unauthorized access. For example, and in particular, unencrypted e-mail is not a "secure" means of communicating with us, since e-mail may be intercepted by a third party in the course of its delivery. By using our Site and corresponding with us, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.

You are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, membership numbers and pin numbers, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use of our Site by you or any person or entity using a password provided to you, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee, relative or agent. You agree to (a) immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password, account or membership number, or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. It is your sole responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your account and membership number, and notify us when you desire to cancel your account on our Site. We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.

We will never request that you send us any sensitive PII, such as your credit card number, password, membership number or pin number, in an e-mail or into a web site that is not located at the avis.com domain name. If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any such information via e-mail or to a web site that is not on such domain name, please do not provide such information, and report such request to our privacy officer at [Avisprivacy@avis.com](mailto:Avisprivacy@avis.com).

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your PII in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.

How to Correct or Update Personally Identifiable Information that Avis Maintains Or Opt Out of Receiving Marketing Materials from Avis

You can opt-out of our use and disclosure of your PII for marketing purposes and customer satisfaction surveys, and/or withdraw your prior consent for same, by the methods provided below.
