## Here are the types of information we gather. 

Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. When you request a quote or purchase a policy on this site we ask for your personally identifiable information such as your name, phone number, address, e-mail address and social security number. 

Transaction Information: This is information directly relating to the services you acquire using our services. It includes services provided to you and associated costs, payment history, insurance claims history, and information necessary for ongoing service, billing and payment. 

Consumer Report Information: In order to provide you with a quote our service providers may order consumer reports relating to your credit, driving record and loss history. If you request they will provide you with the name and address of the consumer reporting agency from whom the reports were ordered. By obtaining quotes or applying for services on our site, you are consenting to the ordering of such reports. 

Automatic Information: We receive this information from your computer when you visit our Web site, including the Web site you visited before ours, your browser, screen resolution, and operating system. We also store "cookies" on your computer to save information entered during the quoting and comparative rate process, and collect technical data, such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, and session ID. 

Information from Other Sources: We will receive information from those referring you to us. We will keep and update information necessary to provide comparative quotes and to service policies. We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. 

## Here is how we use the information you provide.

 We use your personal information to create your quote. We transmit this information to participating service providers to quote and ultimately provide you with the services you select. 

We may share aggregated statistical information from our database with our participating service providers or business partners (for example, the percentage of customers who purchased services relative to those who got a quote). When doing this type of reporting we will not disclose your personally identifiable information. 

All information you give us on this Web site is stored on our computer servers. You may, for example, retrieve this information to get an updated quote. 

Our business changes constantly. This Privacy policy will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time of use. We invite customers to visit the website occasionally to check for program changes and the latest Privacy Statement. Please note that this Privacy Policy only governs the data held by CarInsurance.com and does not apply to the participating service provider once you purchase their services. We encourage you to read their policies. 

We use your e-mail address to confirm your purchases and to provide you reminders about our products and services. You can opt out of receiving future e-mail reminders from CarInsurance.com by indicating that desire [ here](http://www.carinsurance.com/optout.aspx). 

You can always choose not to provide personal information, even though it might be needed to obtain a quote or obtain service. 

At any point while completing the quote questionnaire you can navigate to previous pages and make any necessary changes. When you save your quote information you can return at any time to change the information. Simply log in on the site, select Review or Purchase. To change the information displayed, type the new data in the form and click the Continue button found on the page. 

If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, you may indicate this. Such an indication would include notices we might send out regarding changes in policies, such as changes to this Privacy Policy. The change will still govern, and it is your responsibility to review these policies for changes. You can choose not to receive this information by:

  * Using our [online opt out form](http://www.carinsurance.com/optout.aspx). 
  * Sending an e-mail to CustomerService@CarInsurance.com; or 
  * Calling 1-877-327-8728 
  * The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you will not be able to easily retrieve your quote if you do not allow cookies. 



## Here is how we safeguard your information.

Our systems are configured to provide privacy, integrity, and authentication in Internet communications. The security measures we have taken help ensure that your data is secure and encrypted, so that a third party cannot capture, read or access the information while it is in transit between your computer and our system. Some of the key features are outlined below. 

We use a secure server implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to interact with you when you provide personal information during the purchase and payment processes;  
Your information is encrypted using 128 bit encryption. AOL, Netscape Navigator 4.06 or higher and Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher are capable of 128-bit browsers. You can tell when you are visiting a secure area in our site by looking at the symbol on the bottom of your browser screen. If you are using Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see either a lock or a key. When the symbol appears unbroken or the padlock is in the locked position, your session connection is taking place via a secure server. 

Our data security architecture provides for extraordinarily limited access to your credit card or checking account information, though we do transmit the entire number to the appropriate service provider when you purchase a service; and 

We limit internal access to our servers and require that our people adhere to high standards of ethics and integrity in performing their jobs and conducting business. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, CarInsurance.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or any information provided by our on-line products or services, and you do so at your own risk. CarInsurance.com will not be liable for disclosures of your personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. However, once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to close all browser applications when finished using a shared computer. 

## With whom we share this information.

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We disclose information about you to the following people: 

The service providers who may be providing comparative rates to you. They may in turn disclose this information to others to complete a quote, complete a transaction, and service you after that transaction. The information sought may include credit reports, motor vehicle reports, previous claims activity and other relevant information. The parties providing this information include affiliated insurance underwriting companies, claims representatives, independent contractors, insurance support organizations, insurance agents and brokers, and courts and government agencies. 

We may also disclose quote information and transaction information about you and our former customers to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to third parties with whom we have joint marketing agreements, and to companies that have referred you to us or that have a relationship with you. 

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other companies or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that CarInsurance.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 

Aggregate Information: CarInsurance.com shares the information you provided in aggregate form, to serve ads and to provide on-line and off-line promotions. When we say that we will share such information in "aggregate" form, we mean that we will not disclose individual names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, or other personally identifiable information unless we have your permission. 

We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We may also share information with other third parties to administer our business or provide additional related services, and as otherwise permitted or required by law. 

## Our site has links to other web sites.

During your visit to our site, you may come across links that will take you to third-party Web sites. CarInsurance.com does not control the content of or the information collected from these third-party Web sites. These third-party Web sites are not subject to CarInsurance.com's Privacy Policy.
