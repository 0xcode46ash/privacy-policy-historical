Personal information may include name, email address, physical address, telephone or facsimile number or demographic information such as age, gender and personal interests. Once your information is collected, it is then forwarded to the applicable entity (for example, an educational institution to which you requested information). In the context of education, upon the school(s)’ receipt of your information, an admissions representative will contact you via telephone, email or direct mail to assist with your request. Additionally, a representative from CAREERS or a third party may use your personally identifiable information that you provided to subsequently contact you by telephone in order to confirm your interest and assist you in the process, as well as to obtain your feedback on the quality of the follow-up you received and/or discuss additional education related opportunities.
