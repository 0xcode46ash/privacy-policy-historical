Questions About This Policy  
Your Consent  
Please take a few minutes to review this Policy before using our Sites. By using our Sites you are  
consenting to the collection, use, and disclosure of information as set forth in this Policy. If you  
do not agree to be bound by this Policy, you may not access or use our Sites.  
This Policy is Part of Our Terms of Use  
This Policy is part of the Terms of Use that govern your use of our Sites. A link to our Terms of  
Use is provided at the bottom of each page of our Sites.  
Privacy Notices  
This Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by “privacy notices” posted on  
our Sites. These privacy notices provide a level of detail that we cannot provide in this more  
general description of our privacy practices. For example, certain pages of our Sites may contain  
privacy notices providing details about the information we collect on those pages, why we need  
that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information.  
Types of Information We Collect  
The information we collect through this Site falls into two categories: (1) data that you manually  
supply (by using a keyboard or touch screen), some of which may be Personal Information, and  
(2) non-personally identifiable information we collect automatically. In this Policy “Personal  
Information” means information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with  
other information available to us. Examples of Personal Information include your name, address,  
and email address.  
Please remember that this Policy applies only to information we obtain through our Sites.  
However, we may supplement the information we obtain through our Sites with information we  
obtain through other channels, such as from third parties, including our franchisees and data  
brokers. For example, we may supplement your profile with demographic and preference  
information that is supplied to us for each zip code in our database. By supplementing your  
profile, we are better able to provide product recommendations and special offers that will be of  
genuine interest to you. We may also use this additional information to further personalize our  
Sites and improve your experience while you are on our Sites.  
Information You Manually Supply. ENRG collects all the data you and others knowingly,  
voluntarily, and manually provide when you use our Sites. Some of this data may be Personal  
Information. For example, we collect the Personal Information you provide when you place an  
order, sign up for our clubs and/or email updates, or contact us with questions.  
At some of our Sites, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a  
gift or gift card or certificate online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you must submit the  
recipient’s name and address. We use this information to send your gift to the recipient. We also  
store this information so that you do not have to reenter it the next time you send a gift to the  
same recipient. We do not use this information to add the recipient to our mailing lists. On some  
of our Sites, you can email a message to a friend by entering your friend’s name and email  
address. We use the information you provide to personalize and send the message to your friend.  
We do not use this information for our mailing lists.  
Some of our Sites have “Career” areas where you can search for open positions and apply for a  
job with us. When you submit an employment application, we ask you to provide certain  
Personal Information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email  
address, and employment history. If you send us an email to inquire about a position, the  
information we receive is the information you include in your cover letter, resume and email  
message. Please note that by submitting your information regarding employment opportunities to  
us, you authorize us to transmit and store your information in our recruitment database, to  
circulate that information as necessary for the purpose of evaluating your qualifications for job  
vacancies at ENRG, and to contact you about a possible employment opportunity. If you are  
hired by ENRG, the information you provide during the recruiting process will become part of  
our employee records. The Career areas of our Sites are powered by CareerBuilder. To learn  
more about the services CareerBuilder provides, please visit CareerBuilder.com.  
Information from Third–Party Social Media Platforms: You may be able to register with, log-on  
to, or enhance your profile on our Sites through a third–party social media platform, such as  
Facebook. By doing this, you are asking the third-party platform to send us registration  
information from your profile on that platform. We treat that information as we do any other  
information you give to us when you register, log-on, or enhance your profile. After you have  
connected, the third party may also send us additional information from your profile that allows  
us to offer certain functionalities on the pages you view.  
To learn how to disconnect one of our Sites from Facebook, click here. ENRG is not responsible  
for Facebook or the use or operation thereof. The foregoing is based on Facebook functionality  
as of the effective date of this Policy and you should see the Facebook Help Center for current  
information regarding Facebook and Facebook Connect, including use of Facebook Connect and  
disconnecting Facebook Connect.  
Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser: We collect information that is sent to us  
automatically by your web browser. This information typically includes your IP address, the  
identity of your Internet service provider, the name and version of your operating system, the  
name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages on our Sites that  
you visit. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends  
or how to change your settings.  
Your IP address is the identifier assigned to your particular computer when you access the  
Internet. IP addresses do not include your name, email address or other Personal Information, but  
in some cases, they can be used to identify you. For example, we or our service providers may  
link your IP address to account information that identifies you personally. If we suspect  
inappropriate or criminal activity or a threat to our Sites or their users, we may also share our  
server logs—which contain users’ IP addresses—with the appropriate investigative authorities,  
who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.  
Cookies and Similar Technologies. We use “cookies” and other web technologies to collect  
information and support certain features of our Sites. For example, we may use these  
technologies to:  
 collect information about the ways visitors use our Sites—which pages they visit, which  
links they use, and how long they stay on each page;  
 to support the features and functionality of our Sites—for example, to save you the  
trouble of reentering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you  
established on previous visits;  
 to personalize your experience when you use our Sites; and  
 to serve targeted advertisements about our products and services.  
Generally, the information we collect using these web technologies does not identify you  
personally. We may, however, link the information that we collect through cookies with Personal  
Information that you provide to us.  
Generally, if you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to  
alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Please note, however, that your browser  
cannot screen out cookies that are sent by email.  
Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit this Site, you may be unable to  
use all of the functionality of this Site if your browser rejects our cookies.  
Information from your mobile device: If you download one of our mobile applications or access  
one of our Sites through your mobile device, we may automatically collect certain information  
from or about your device. The types of information we may collect include the type of device  
you use, your device’s unique ID, the IP address of your device, your device’s operating system,  
the type of mobile browsers you use, and information about the way you use our mobile  
application.  
We may also collect information about your device’s geographic location, so that we can direct  
you to our nearby stores. We do not retain precise, real-time location information. Your mobile  
or tablet device may allow you to adjust your settings so that location information is not  
available to any mobile website or application. If you have questions about the security and  
privacy settings of your mobile or tablet device, please refer to instructions from your mobile  
service provider or the manufacturer of your device.  
Collection of Information Through Third-Party Cookies  
In addition to the cookies we deliver to your computer through our Sites, certain third parties  
may deliver cookies to you for a variety of reasons. For example, we use Google Analytics, a  
web analytics tool that helps us understand how visitors engage with our Sites. Other third  
parties may deliver cookies to your computer for the purpose of tracking your online behaviors  
across nonaffiliated websites and delivering targeted advertisements either on our Sites or on  
other websites.  
You have choices about the collection of information by third parties on our Sites. For example,  
if you don’t want information about your visit to our Sites sent to Google Analytics, you may  
download an Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here. Please note that the Add-on does not  
prevent information from being sent to ENRG.  
In addition, if you would like to opt-out of having interest-based information collected by certain  
entities during your visits to our Sites or other websites, please click here. You will be directed to  
an industry-developed website that contains mechanisms for choosing whether each listed entity  
may collect and use data for online behavioral advertising purposes. It may be that some of the  
third parties that collect interest-based information on our Sites do not participate in the industrydeveloped  
opt-out website, in which case the best way to avoid third-party tracking of your  
online behaviors may be through your browser settings and deletion of cookies.

 to provide the information, products and services you request;  
 for security, credit or fraud prevention purposes;

Steps We Take to Safeguard your Personal Information  
We maintain reasonable administrative, physical and technological measures to protect the  
confidentiality and security of Personal Information you submit on or through this Site.

this Site.  
How We Share Your Information With Others  
Third–Party Vendors. We share information collected through our Sites with third-party vendors  
who act for or on our behalf. For example, we may use third-party vendors for warehousing and  
delivery; marketing and advertising; data processing; software development; website hosting and  
management; information technology and office services; and legal, accounting, audit and other  
professional services. These third-party vendors may need information about you to perform  
their functions.  
Within the ENRG Family of Businesses. When you upload information to one of our Sites, the  
owner of that Site may share your information with other members of the ENRG Family of  
Businesses. Before doing so, however, the owner of the Site may offer you the opportunity to  
“opt out” or “opt in,” as required by applicable law. Every member of the ENRG Family of  
Businesses is required to handle information collected through our Sites in accordance with this  
Policy and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.  
Franchisees. Many of our stores are owned and operated by our franchisees. We do not currently  
share the information we collect through this Site with our franchisees, except to provide the  
products, services or information you request. For example, if you place a catering order, we  
will share the information needed to fill your order and provide customer service for the  
appropriate store location.  
User-Generated Content: In this Policy, “User-Generated Content” or “UGC” refers to all of  
content that you post on or through our Sites using the social networking tools we make available  
to you and that does not constitute Feedback. The UGC you submit on or through our Sites is  
available to others who visit our Sites. Any Personal Information contained in UGC can be read,  
collected, or used by others, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. In addition, we  
may use UGC you submit on or through our Sites for advertising campaigns and other  
promotions. We may or may not use your name in connection with such use, and we may or may  
not seek your consent before using the content for such purposes. Therefore, you should have no  
expectation of privacy with respect to UGC you submit on or through our Sites. You should not  
submit any content you do not wish to make available to the general public, and you must take  
special care to make sure your submissions comply with our Terms of Use. In particular, your  
submissions must not violate the privacy or other rights of others.  
Business Partners. From time to time, we may share your information with selected third parties  
(other than our vendors) for their own marketing purposes. Before doing so, however, we may  
offer you the opportunity to “opt out” or “opt in” as required by applicable law.  
Business Transfers. Your information may be transferred to successor organization if, for  
example, we transfer the ownership or operation of one or more of our Sites to another  
organization or if we merge with another organization.  
Compliance with Laws and Protection of Our Rights and the Rights of Others. We may disclose  
your information when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the  
law, a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose your information to prevent or  
investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to protect the security of this Site; to

Personal Information as described in that privacy notice.

however, that we have no control over third–party websites. This Policy does not apply to  
Personal Information collected on any third-party website. When you access third–party websites
