Capitalised terms in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given to them in the Tescocars.com [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms/).

## 1\. Information collected

Tesco Cars collects the details provided by you on registration of your Account together with information we learn about you from your use of the Services and your visits to our web site and other sites accessible from them. We also collect information about the Tesco Cars Purchases and other related transactions which you undertake including details of payment cards used.

We may collect additional information in connection with your participation in any promotions or competitions offered by us and information you provide when giving us feedback or completing profile forms. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site use which enables us to improve the service we provide.

## 2\. Use of your information

You consent to our using the information collected:

  * to provide and personalise the Services to you;
  * to facilitate the arrangements to complete any Tesco Cars Purchases;
  * to communicate with you; and
  * for passing onto third parties upon the terms set out in paragraph 3 below.



We will use your contact details to communicate with you. We may use your information to send you offers and news about Tesco group products and services or those of other carefully selected companies which we think may be of interest to you. We also like to hear your views to help us improve our service. We may contact you by email for these purposes. If you do not wish to be contacted by us in this way, please send an e-mail to the address provided above.

We may also use your information to verify your identity and prevent or detect fraud. In performing these checks your information may be disclosed to credit reference agencies, who may keep a record of that information. This is not a credit check and your credit rating will be unaffected.

Please note that there may be instances where it may be necessary for us to communicate with you, in any event, for administrative or operational reasons relating to the Services.

We may disclose your information to any relevant or interested third party who has a legitimate interest in progressing any transaction or proposed transaction (including Tesco Cars Purchases) in which you have indicated that you wish to participate. These will include:

  * the Seller;
  * any organisation involved in the financial arrangements of any transaction; and
  * other service providers or duly authorised agents.



In addition, your information may be passed to and used by all Tesco companies.

We will never pass your personal information to anyone else, except:

  * where we are required or permitted to do so by law;
  * where the disclosure is necessary for the performance of our operations i.e. mail delivery, hosting services, and payment of your Account;
  * to any successors in title to our business; and
  * to suppliers that process information on our behalf both in the UK and abroad.



We may also use and disclose information in aggregate (so that no individual customers are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes.
