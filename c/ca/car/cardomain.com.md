Usage of a cookie may be linked to personally identifiable information. Cookies may be used to enhance the user experience. For instance, by setting a cookie, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while accessing the CarDomain Network. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use the CarDomain Network. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of the CarDomain Network. Cookies can also enable CarDomain to track and target the interests of users to enhance the user experience.
  * CarDomain may set and access cookies on your computer.



## Log Files/IP Addresses/Browsing History

  * CarDomain may use log files, IP addresses, and browsing history and information to analyze trends, administer the CarDomain Network, track a user's movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Some of this information may be shared with third parties - these third parties (except for the entity which "anonymizes the data") will only use or have access to the information in anonymized form.



## Information Sharing and Disclosure

  * CarDomain may share your personally-identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, as well as a record of any transactions you conduct on our website or offline with us though a third-party advertising partner and its service providers, which will merge that information with information gathered from other sources in order to deliver to you banner advertisements and other advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain websites.

    * who then anonymize it and provide it to advertising partners to use for advertising purposes;
    * who analyze it on behalf of CarDomain;
    * in response to a subpoena, court order or other legal process;
