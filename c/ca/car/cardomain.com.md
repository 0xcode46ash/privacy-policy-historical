# CarDomain Network's Privacy Policy

CarDomain Network takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.   
   
  **What this Privacy Policy Covers**  
  
  * This Privacy Policy covers CarDomain Network's treatment of personally identifiable information that CarDomain Network collects when you are on the CarDomain Network suite of sites, and when you use CarDomain Network's services. This policy also covers CarDomain Network's treatment of any personally identifiable information that CarDomain Network's business partners share with CarDomain Network or that CarDomain Network may collect on a partner's site. 
  * This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that CarDomain Network does not own or control, or to people that CarDomain Network does not employ or manage.   
 

  
  **Information Collection and Use**  
  
  * CarDomain Network collects personally identifiable information when you register for a CarDomain Network membership, when you sign up for a CarDomain Network email newsletter, when you purchase a product or service from CarDomain Network, when you visit CarDomain Network pages, and when you enter our promotions or sweepstakes. CarDomain Network may also receive personally identifiable information from our business partners. 
  * CarDomain Network uses information for three general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to contact you about specials and new products. 
  * CarDomain Network requests information from you on our order form when making purchases. Here you must provide contact information (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your order. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you. 
  * Once you register with CarDomain Network and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. 
  * CarDomain Network also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, CarDomain Network cookie information and the page you requested. 

  
  **Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
  
  * CarDomain Network will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. 
  * CarDomain Network may send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when: 
    * We have your consent to share the information; 
    * We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; 
    * We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of CarDomain Network to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.); 
    * We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or 
    * We find that your actions on our web sites violate the CarDomain Network Terms of Service or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services. 

  
  **Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

  * CarDomain Network may set and access CarDomain Network cookies on your computer. 
  * Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to CarDomain Network's cookies. 

  
  **Log Files**  
CarDomain Network uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.   
   
  **Links**  
The CarDomain Network contains links to other sites. Be aware that the CarDomain Network are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. Again, this privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.   
   
  **Membership**  
In order to fully use the community site of CarDomain.com, you must first register as a member of the CarDomain.com site. CarDomain.com is a fully owned and operated member of the CarDomain Network. During membership registration, you are required to give your contact information (such as, but not limited to, name and email address). It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and education) and other unique identifiers, but is encouraged so CarDomain Network can provide a more personalized experience on our sites.   
   
  **Newsletter**  
If you wish to subscribe to one of our newsletters, the CarDomain Network asks for information such as, but not limited to, name and email address. By subscribing, you agree to receive the CarDomain Network email newsletter which may or may not include special offers or incentives from select partners. Again, we do not share your email information with our partner/advertisers. 

  * If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link appearing at the end of any email newsletter communication. 

  
  **Surveys and Contests**  
From time-to-time the CarDomain Network requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include, but not limited to, contact information (such as name, email) demographic information (such as age, zip code).   
   
  **Tell-A-Friend**  
At various times, the CarDomain Network may decide to promote a referral service for informing a friend about the CarDomain Network suite of sites. We will ask for a friend's name and email address. The CarDomain Network will automatically send them one (1) one-time email inviting them to visit the site. The CarDomain Network stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact CarDomain Network at [support@cardomain.com](mailto:support@cardomain.com) to request removal of their information from the CarDomain Network database.   
   
  **Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences**  
CarDomain Network gives you the ability to edit your CarDomain Network Account Information and preferences at any time, including whether you want CarDomain Network to contact you about specials and new products.   
   
  **Security**  
  
  * Your CarDomain Network Account Information is password-protected for your privacy and security. 
  * In certain areas CarDomain Network uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions. 

  
  **Anti-Spam Policy**  
CarDomain Network, Inc is completely against and actively discourages unsolicited e-mail ("Spam"). Maintaining our email recipients' privacy is one of our main concerns. We address this by requiring that each email message sent by our servers include an easy way for the recipients to remove themselves from the list (opt-out). In the event that a recipient cannot easily remove him or herself, our customer advocacy staff is available to remove that person from further email communications. 

  * Definition of Spam   
"Spam", as used in this policy, means any unsolicited email, generally received as part of a mass mailing or sent to an inappropriate list. Spam is also considered to be any promotion, information or solicitation that is sent to a person via email without his or her prior consent or permission. Spam is most often an e-mail message sent to a large number of people without their consent. Also known as Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (UCE), or junk e-mail, it is usually sent to promote a product or service. 
  * Common Forms of Spam 
    * An email message sent to a recipient that does not contain a way for the recipient to opt-out or request that future mailings not be sent to them. 
    * Any email message sent to recipients who have not had any prior association with the organization, or did not agree to be sent email messages by the organization or their partners as mentioned in the opt-in/out information.
