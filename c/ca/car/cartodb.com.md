# Privacy Policy — CARTO

## Privacy Policy

Welcome to CARTO, owned and operated by CartoDB Inc. (“CARTO”, “us,” or “we”), a New York corporation. The CARTO Privacy Policy explains the information collected and stored at CARTO and associated applications, web services, and other mechanisms associated with CARTO (collectively, the “Service”). The Privacy Policy also explains how we use the information collected on the Service.

## How you accept this Policy

By visiting the CARTO website (the “Site”) or using the Service, including by registering, or by otherwise providing us with personally identifiable information (such as an email address), you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. 

## Information we collect that is not personal information

We collect information that is not personally identifiable in connection with use of the Site or the Service, such as login and device-related information (examples are: browser type, your IP address, and the date and time of day of your use).

## How we use information that is not personal information:

We may use collected information to enhance the visitor experience of the Service, to operate and maintain the Service, to investigate and understand how our Service is used, to monitor and protect the security and integrity of the Service, and to analyze our business.

We analyze traffic to the site in various ways, including using a service called Google Analytics. We use this information to generate statistics and to measure activity to improve the usefulness of the Site and the Service.

Google Analytics is subject to the privacy policy of Google. By visiting the Site or using the Service, you are agreeing to the terms of the Google Privacy Policy that apply to Google Analytics. These terms can be found at “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps”, located at <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/>, or any other URL Google may provide from time to time.

We are not responsible for any changes made to the Google Privacy Policy or of advising you of such changes. We reserve the right to change analytical service providers at any time without notice.

## Cookies:

We use cookies to make interactions with the Site easy and meaningful. When you visit the Site, our servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself by opening an account, or filling out a form, you remain anonymous to us.

## Personal information that is collected:

If you choose our paid plan, personal information is collected (i.e. Name, address, email address, phone number, credit card information and organization information).

For customers that use the free version of CARTO we collect the following information: Name, email, password and some social media information (e.g. Twitter handle) that you may choose provide to us

We also may collect personal information if you contact us or otherwise give it to us (e.g., in an email).

## How we use and disclose personal information:

We may use personal information to enhance the visitor experience of the Service, to operate and maintain the Service, to investigate and understand how the Service is used, to monitor and protect the security and integrity of the Service, and to analyze our business.

The Company may also use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in the Services and to send you information regarding CARTO.

We may disclose personal information as required by law or in response to service of legal process, such as a court order, summons, subpoena, or the like.

We may share personal information with our corporate affiliates and with business partners who provide services related to the Service (such as website hosting or payment processing). These business partners do not have the right to use this personal information for any purpose other than those related to the Service.

Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed or transferred to entities now or in the future affiliated with CARTO or as part of any merger, acquisition, change of control, debt financing, insolvency, bankruptcy or sale of our assets. Such information may be used in the businesses of any entity so receiving it.

Except as provided above, we will not sell or transfer your personal information to third parties.

## Do Not Track

Currently, various browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites' visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. We do not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Site, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. However, we will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.

## How you can access or change the personal information that we have collected

Once you have registered with us, you can access your profile, review the information that is stored, and revise that information. We may not immediately delete residual copies of outdated information from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.

## Customer data

Customer data is all the information, including personal information, text, images, location data or any other files that the customers provide, or are provided on your behalf, to the Company through your use of the Service. We inform you that you will be the only responsible party of the provision of personal information. In regard to the compliance of the Privacy rules, you shall notify the provision of personal information to the Company through the address provided below.

The Company will not collect this personal information. We will only process the personal information for the provision of the Service and it will not be processed for any other purposes.

## Children

We do not target, market to, or knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen years.

## Data Retention

We retain your personal information for 2 years after which it is destroyed.

## Data Security

We use industry standard physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure the security of any information you transmit to the Service, and you do so at your own risk. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing or by emailing us at [support@carto.com](mailto:support@carto.com).
