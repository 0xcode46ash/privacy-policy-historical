This is the privacy policy of Car.com and its parent company StoneAge Corporation. It covers the site at, and all information obtained through, the domain Car.com. Read below to learn about what information we collect and how we use it. 

By using one or both sites, you agree to the terms in this privacy policy. 

  * We use a purchase request or order form to allow you to request information, products, and services through the sites. We will ask for your contact information (name, address, e-mail address, etc.) and, if necessary, your financial information (credit card number, expiration date, etc.). The contact information allows us to process your request, fulfill your order and to get in touch with you if necessary. The financial information that we collect is used to bill you for products and services or to qualify you for certain financial services (e.g., loans, leases, etc.). We may share this information with others according to this privacy policy. 
  * Click here to review our Disclaimer. 
  * We may also ask for, and receive, demographic information like zip code, age, and income level. We use this data to tailor your experience at our site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. We may share this information with others according to this privacy policy. 
  * We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our sites. We may share this information with others according to this privacy policy. 
  * We use "cookie" technology to better serve our customers. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored on your computer for recordkeeping and are an industry standard used at most major web sites. We use cookies to save certain information about you, which enables us to simplify and facilitate your future activities. We do not use cookies to obtain personal information from your computer unless we obtain your consent to do so or you have given the personal information to us by some means other than a cookie. 
  * We may share aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and other site information with our business affiliates. This aggregated information does not include personally identifiable information. 
  * We may release your information if required to do so by law, in connection with any legal or regulatory proceeding or investigation, or if we reasonably believe it to be necessary to protect our electronic or other resources from damage or misappropriation. Without limiting the disclosure above, if served with a subpoena, search warrant, or court order, we would provide the requested information. 
  * We may use the information we collect to occasionally send you notices about important changes and new services and special offers in which we think you will be interested. You may opt out of receiving mailings by sending an email to remove@car.com. We will make reasonable efforts to remove you from our lists. This task is usually accomplished using batch processing, which may take several days. If we have provided your information to others as permitted by this privacy policy, opting out of our mailing list may not stop any communications from parties with whom we have shared your information. 
  * We may have relationships with third parties in order to provide additional products and services to you.

  * One or both sites may contain links to third-party websites or other resources. These links are provided as a convenience to you.
