**Other Uses of Information**

We also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to CareerCast.com (for example, the number of new profiles created) with its clients, partners and other third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the CareerCast.com Site and how those visitors use the CareerCast.com Site. We may also aggregate on an anonymous basis data regarding job qualifications, schooling, age, experience level or other information relevant to the job search or competition among Seekers for any such job.

All information provided will be kept separate from your expression of interest in any job opportunity. Providing this information is strictly voluntary and you will not be subject to any adverse action or treatment if you choose not to provide this information.

**Personal Information on Resumes and Profiles**

Since CareerCast.com is a career site, we give you three options regarding the accessibility of your resume:

> 1\. You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable by potential employers. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database product. 

> 2\. If you allow your resume to be searchable without making it confidential and hiding your contact information, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. 

> 3\. If you have a confidential resume, but apply to a job posting on CareerCast.com, the employer to whom you send your resume will be able to view your contact information. 

In addition, portions of your searchable resume (but not your contact information) may be made public in your CareerCast.com profile.

We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. However, the portions of your searchable resume (not your contact information) that are automatically made public in your CareerCast.com profile are accessible to anyone who uses the CareerCast.com profile service. You may remove your resume from CareerCast.com or delete your profile on CareerCast.com at anytime, but, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to the CareerCast.com resume database or to obtain a copy of that database or have paid for access to the CareerCast.com services, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access may have retained a copy of your resume or CareerCast.com profile in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles in these instances.

**Posting to Public Areas of CareerCast.com**

Please remember that if you post any of your personal information in public areas of CareerCast.com, such as in online forums, blogs, chat rooms, or in the CareerCast.com searchable resume database, such information may be collected and used by others over whom we have no control. We are not responsible for the use made by third parties of information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of CareerCast.com.
