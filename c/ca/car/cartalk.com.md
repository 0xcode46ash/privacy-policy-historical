# Car Talk: Privacy Policy

**Revised January, 2004**

Thank you for visiting the cartalk.com Web site. 

"Car Talk" is a registered service mark of Tom and Ray Magliozzi. "cartalk.com" is a production of Dewey, Cheetham and Howe. Contents © 2004, Dewey, Cheetham and Howe. 

Our postal address is P.O. Box 3500, Car Talk Plaza, Harvard Square, Cambridge, MA 02238. You may also contact us via email at [feedback@cartalk.com](mailto:feedback@cartalk.com). 

**cartalk.com's Privacy Policy**  
Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operations of cartalk.com, we gather certain types of information about cartalk.com users. This Privacy Policy explains the types of information we gather and what we do with it. 

**Information collected by cartalk.com**  
cartalk.com collects two types of information about users: 

  * Personal information (such as name and email address) and 
  * Aggregate information (such as information about how many users log on to our site on a daily basis). 



**Personal Information**  
Within cartalk.com, you may be asked to give us personal information, such as when you ask a question via email that requires a response. cartalk.com will not obtain personally identifying information about you when you visit our site unless you choose to provide it to us (except for IP addresses described below in "Aggregate Information"). 

We will not voluntarily sell, give away, or trade names, addresses or any personally identifiable information about our site users (without their expressed permission) to any third parties. We will not otherwise release such information unless not doing so endangers the Web site or is required by law or in the courts. 

**Aggregate Information**  
One method of collecting aggregate information about your activities online (such as the pages you access most frequently or the search terms you enter), and information volunteered by you (such as survey information), is by tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. The computers that deliver the Web pages to you automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from our site, our server logs your IP address. 

Our site records IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide aggregate data to advertisers about the use of our site. We also create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows these parties to advertise more effectively and allows you to receive advertisements that are most relevant to your personal interests. An advertiser will not know that you clicked its advertisement unless you voluntarily and explicitly permit us to provide such information. 

**Use of Information Collected by cartalk.com**  
cartalk.com uses the personal information we collect to: 

  * Improve the content of our site; 
  * To customize the content and/or layout of our site for each individual user; 
  * To notify users about updates to our sites or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to users; 
  * To fulfill requests for information, services, or products that our users make of our Web site; and 
  * To investigate violations of our terms and conditions of use. 



**Sharing Data with Third Parties**  
cartalk.com shares aggregate information with third parties for advertising and promotional purposes. 

Occasionally, we may post the name of a user (for example, a puzzler winner or letter writer) on our site. cartalk.com will notify you of this possibility when you provide your information or, if possible, will notify you when the information is posted. 

cartalk.com uses a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our Web site. This company may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to our site and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. In addition, we share Web site usage information about visitors to our sites with this company for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements on our Web site and other Web sites. For this purpose, we and our third-party advertising company note some of the pages you visit on our Web site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs or single-pixel gifs). In the course of serving advertisements to this Web site, our third-party advertising company may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your computer. If you would like more information about the information collection practices of this third-party advertising company and to know your choices about not having this information used by this company, [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&). 

**Electronic Newsletters**  
cartalk.com offers free, electronic newsletters as a service to our users. You will only receive a newsletter if you agree to receive it directly from our newsletter sign-up form. cartalk.com reserves the right to include advertising messages in these electronic newsletters; however, we will not divulge our newsletter mailing lists to any third parties, including advertisers or partners. 

**cartalk.com Store**  
cartalk.com provides shopping services in our Shameless Commerce Division. These purchases may require credit card and personal contact information. cartalk.com's shopping services store your information and send it to the fulfillment center automatically when you make your purchase, using encryption technology to protect your information during this transfer. 

We strive to make your shopping experience as worry-free as possible. We use secure server software (SSL), the industry standard for ensuring the security of your electronic commerce transactions. SSL encrypts all of your personal information transmitted over the Internet, including your credit card number and name and address. This technology is designed to protect your information by rendering it useless, should it ever be intercepted in transit. We will continue to provide the highest level of security by implementing improved technologies as they become available. 

**Community and Public Areas**  
Information posted to bulletin boards, car surveys, Mechan-X Files and personal ads is available to the general public. Please use caution when posting any such information. Users of bulletin boards must follow acceptable standards of behavior when posting messages online. cartalk.com reserves the right to, but is not obligated to, refuse or delete any content that in our sole discretion is considered inappropriate. cartalk.com also reserves the right to block a site user entirely if his/her behavior on and use of the site is deemed inappropriate. 

**Links to and from Other Sites**  
Our site contains links to sites other than cartalk.com; similarly, other sites link to cartalk.com. These sites may not follow the same privacy policies as cartalk.com. cartalk.com does not control the content that appears on these sites. Such sites may contain information that content providers independent of cartalk.com have created, maintained, published, posted, or otherwise made available. 

The use of any information or materials that you may access at these external sites is purely voluntary. 

**Children's Guidelines**  
We believe that it is especially important to protect children's privacy online. We encourage parents to get involved with their children's online usage and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. Note: We define "children" as minors younger than 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect or use any personally identifiable information from children, and we do not provide any personally identifiable information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever from our visitors younger than 13 years old. We do not knowingly allow children to register with us or to participate in any of our promotions or contests. No information should be submitted to or posted at cartalk.com by visitors younger than 13 years old. In the event that cartalk.com obtains information from an individual who indicates that he/she is younger than 13 years old, cartalk.com will promptly discard the personally identifiable information without collecting, using, or disclosing such information to any third party. You should be aware that if your child voluntarily discloses his or her name, email address, or other information on any Web site, such disclosures might result in unsolicited messages. 

**Additional Information**  
No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secured. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of cartalk.com to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information, cartalk.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk. 

cartalk.com reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Any such changes will be posted online. Questions should be directed to [feedback@cartalk.com](mailto:feedback@cartalk.com).
