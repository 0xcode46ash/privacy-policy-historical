For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie terminates.

We use a third-party tracking service Nielsen//Netratings that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate for usage and volume statistics to report on site traffic statistics. The Nielsen//NetRatings Measurement Technology is used only for the collection of anonymous web site traffic statistics.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site and Nielsen//Netratings only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

#### 8\. Sharing

We sometimes share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to personally identifiable information.

We also partner with third parties to provide specific services.

CareerJunction maintains relationships with outside service providers for some of the services offered through our site, for example Virtual Card Services (VCS) and FlashWorx.

The information these providers make available may be presented in a "framed" format, where the CareerJunction border will surround the pages served by the service provider, or where pages have the look and feel of CareerJunction. In either case, the service provider is prominently identified.
