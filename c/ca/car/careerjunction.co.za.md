For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie terminates.

We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

We sometimes share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to personally identifiable information.

We also partner with third parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names or other information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

We will not voluntarily disclose any information about individual users, except as described in this privacy statement, or to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of CareerJunction and its partner sites.
