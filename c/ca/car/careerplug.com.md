# Privacy

## CareerPlug Privacy Commitment

### Overview

Your privacy is important to CareerPlug. Please read the terms of this Privacy Policy in order to understand what information we collect, how that information is used, how we protect your information, and other matters related to your use of our website and microsites.

### How We Collect Your Information

CareerPlug collects personal data for the purpose of providing recruiting and related services for our clients and assisting candidates who are interested in learning about career opportunities. CareerPlug collects the career-related personal data that you submit during the registration process, either through our website/microsites or through an online job board such as Monster, CareerBuilder or HotJobs. Our contractual relationships with these online job boards require us to abide by certain regulations regarding the use of your information, as specified in their respective Terms of Service. We will never share any of your personally identifiable information with any third parties for purposes unrelated to recruiting and related services, unless we have obtained your prior expressed authorization. These policies also apply when you submit someone else’s personal information to us in the form of a referral.

### How We Use Your Information

We use your personal information to provide you with information regarding career opportunities and career-related information, and to otherwise provide you with requested information or services. This information is communicated primarily through email messages to you that contain links to personalized recruiting microsites. Each microsite provides you with an overview of an employer’s career opportunity and an option to submit a form indicating that you would like to be contacted by this employer to learn more about the opportunity. You can easily opt out from receiving such email messages from CareerPlug at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link included in the email or by sending an email to “unsubscribe” at “careerplug.com”.

### Security Measures

CareerPlug has security measures in place to protect the confidentiality and security of your personally identifiable information. These measures include both online and offline security measures, including firewalls, passwords and restricted physical access to the places where your personally identifiable information is stored. Your microsites are stored as encrypted web pages on a secure server.

### Revisions to the Privacy Policy

If we make revisions to this privacy policy, we will post them on this website for your review.

### Updating Your Information

You may update your personal information or communication preferences at any time by accessing your preferences page; a link to this page is included in the email communications that we send you. You may also contact us directly via “privacy” at “careerplug.com”.
