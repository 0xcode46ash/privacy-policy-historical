# Privacy Notice

CARTIER has established its Privacy Policy in respect of the confidence its clientele places in it and in conformity with high standards of data protection to which it is committed.

In accordance with French data protection legislation - Loi 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, subsequently modified – any personally identifiable information such as your name, address, contact numbers and preferences etc. (hereinafter referred to as “Personal Information”) you make available to CARTIER is done so voluntarily, with your knowledge and consent when making a request, submission or registration for services from CARTIER. Registration forms contain both mandatory fields (indicated with an asterisk (*)) and non-mandatory fields; if you choose not to complete the mandatory fields then CARTIER may not be able to respond to your request or activate your option choices.

Requests for information made by telephone may be recorded for quality control and to ensure the accuracy of your Personal Information.  
Personal Information provided to us by you will be made available for joint use by duly authorised CARTIER personnel both in the USA and in France, its subsidiary and affiliated companies worldwide, its Customer Relations management agencies and occasionally to other persons or companies who carry out operations in relation to our business such as data cleansing and joint marketing operations. Our subsidiaries and some of our business partners are located outside of the USA and France and consequently you accept that your Personal Information may be either imported to or transferred abroad. However, all such persons/companies are subject to confidentiality agreements and to the strict respect of your privacy in accordance with applicable legislation. The Personal Information made available by you will be used to provide the requested services and may be used both for marketing research purposes relating to CARTIER’s business and to provide information to you relating to its products and events.

Other than as stated above, CARTIER will not use your Personal Information for unsolicited communications. We do not sell, rent or otherwise make available any Personal Information submitted to us to other third parties unless it is to our business partners, our legal advisors or where so required by law or a court decision. CARTIER will use its best endeavours to ensure that your Personal Information is kept secure at all times.

Because our database is in France, it has been registered for automatic processing of data of a personal nature with the French Data authorities – CNIL, registration No. 1098236.

On request, CARTIER will remove your Personal Information from its database thereby cancelling your registration to any of the CARTIER services. You are also advised that upon written request you may inspect your Personal Information and/or request that information about you be corrected, amended or deleted.

To help us keep your information up to date, please let us know of any changes. If you have registered for an e-mail service you no longer wish to receive, you can opt-out through an automated service by following the instructions at the end of the e-mail.
