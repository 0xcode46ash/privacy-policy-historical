Privacy Policy

**Our Pledge to You**

CareerPerfect respects your privacy. CareerPerfect does not sell or rent any identifiable information regarding its customers to any third party. Any information you give us is held with the utmost care and security, and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented.

**Use of Information**

When you purchase a career planning software program and take the included assessments, all of your assessment results are strictly confidential. CareerPerfect will only provide to its career assessment publishing partners the information needed to score and provide you with your assessment results. CareerPerfect will never disclose your assessment results to any third party.

CareerPerfect will not collect any personal information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. Examples of such information are: name, postal address, e-mail address, and phone number.

CareerPerfect may share _non_ -personal summary information, regarding its customers with partners or other third parties in order to provide a personalized browsing experience and/or personalized products or services. CareerPerfect may share customer information with trustworthy partners, but you can tell us not to by sending a blank e-mail message to [admin@CareerPerfect.com](mailto:admin@CareerPerfect.com) and type "never" in the subject line.

When you purchase products from CareerPerfect or register for any CareerPerfect services, we automatically place you on our list to receive e-mail regarding updates about new services, special offers, and new products.

**Cookies**

"Cookies" are a feature of your Internet Web browser that uses a file called a "cookie" file to assign a unique identification to your computer that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. Websites that use cookies create and then use these cookie files to identify your computer as you go through their Website, to make an online purchase, or to recognize you when you return to provide customized services. Cookies only identify your computer — not you personally, or any of your personal information. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser preferences to notify you each time a cookie is used or prevent the use of cookies altogether. Keep in mind that if you disable cookies you may not be able to use the features of some Websites.

CareerPerfect does not use cookies on the main content areas of this site. Cookies are used when you purchase software at the Career Software Store to ensure your purchase is completed successfully, and when you subsequently take an online assessment to enable you to access your results.

**Summary**

We respect your privacy, so if we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
