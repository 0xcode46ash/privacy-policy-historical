You hereby acknowledge that SAP as a global Company operates joint administrative and cross-national by using multiple systems in order to share information about human resources for the purposes of a unified recruiting system. SAP may process the personal data manually or automatically by authorized employees of SAP and/or other authorized assigned third parties. SAP has internal policies that enable an equal security standard globally within SAP to comply with applicable data protection laws. Furthermore any assigned third party processing Your personal data on behalf of SAP, if the case may be, shall be obliged to maintain confidentiality and follow the same strict security measures of SAP.  
Your personal data may be stored and processed by SAP to share it with any member of SAP Group worldwide within the scope of the recruiting purposes and for contacting You about job opportunity at SAP.

When You register as a user on the website Careers at SAP, SAP may record your IP address, name, surname, date of birth, address, telephone number or email-address and use cookies and other Internet technologies as referred to within the SAP Privacy Statement (http://www.sap.com/corporate-en/legal/privacy.epx) to gather general information about You.   
By registering as a user on the website Careers at SAP, You explicitly confirm that you are interested in an employment at SAP. You therefore voluntarily provide Your personal data to be used for recruiting purposes, in particular for filling and matching your profile with any and all open positions at SAP, including beyond those for which you specifically applied. The registration process is a default setting of the application process. If your application refers solely to one specific job opportunity then the process mentioned under Section 2 (Application) below applies. 

By registering as a user on the website Careers at SAP and by releasing your profile, You furthermore agree to SAP contacting you for HR marketing purposes. If, at a specific time, you should no longer wish to be contacted especially for direct marketing or market research, we will respect your choice. Please use the following contact email: [careers@sap.com](mailto:careers@sap.com). Furthermore SAP does not sell your personal data to third parties. If there is a job opportunity within SAP and it matches Your profile, SAP may forward your data to the responsible SAP managers within SAP Group for further validation and in order to contact You for interviews. The personal data will be processed in the form of databases and will be collected in secured personal files. 

You may view and update your account and/or request correction, deletion or locking of your personal data at any time. Please refer to the email address mentioned within the SAP Privacy Statement or use the following “Contact email [mailto:careers@sap.com](mailto:careers@sap.com)”.  
If you do not update your profile within a period of two years, SAP may send you an e-mail to ask you to update your profile. If you do not update your profile by the given deadline, your profile including your personal data will be deleted.  
Please use only private email addresses for requests. SAP will only send information to your private address. 

**2\. Application**  
You also have the possibility to apply solely for one defined job opportunity. To activate these restrictions, You have to mark your user settings accordingly while activating Your registration or before sending Your application.

By applying for a specific job opportunity, You provide SAP with your personal data to the extent as mentioned above. You are responsible for ensuring that the personal data provided by You is correct and true. By submitting your application, You agree to your personal data being used in conjunction with the filling of open positions complying with Your profile by following the above mentioned principles unless stated otherwise below. 

You have the option of withdrawing your application at any time. Your data will be deleted in accordance with the applicable laws once the application process ends or if you withdraw your application. However, your data will not be deleted for a certain time period if you released it for the registration process. In this case, the process described in Section 1 applies.

Please use only private addresses for requests. SAP will only send information to your private address.

**3\. Anonymous Surveys**  
The SAP HR Department continuously wants to improve their processes. Therefore, they will ask applicants (and former applicants with an active account) to participate in anonymous surveys once in a while. These surveys will either be conducted by SAP itself or by an specialized external processor on behalf of SAP. For this purpose any external processor will only get your name, e-mail address and a reference to an organizational unit within SAP. The surveys and the resulting reports will be completely anonymous. Your name and e-mail address will be deleted after our e-mail contact with you. Of course, it is completely up to you, whether you participate in such a survey. In case You prefer not to be contacted for surveys, please use the following mail: [careers@sap.com](mailto:careers@sap.com).

If you have any questions or comments, please contact [careers@sap.com](mailto:careers@sap.com)
