# CareerBuilder Privacy Statement

Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to CareerBuilder, our advertisers and our affiliate Web sites. Below is information about CareerBuilder's commitment to protecting our users' privacy and confidentiality and to ensuring the integrity of the medium. 

**Anonymity and Confidentiality**   
CareerBuilder.com does not sell or otherwise distribute any information provided by users of the site. Resumes sent in response to job postings on CareerBuilder.com go immediately and directly to the company posting the job; resumes will neither stop at nor travel through CareerBuilder, Inc. at any point. 

E-mail addresses submitted to CareerBuilder.com (i.e. registering a Personal Search Agent) are kept confidential and will not be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties. 

Banner ads appearing on CareerBuilder are being served up using DoubleClick's ad server technology. All CareerBuilder users who receive a banner ad remain completely anonymous. We (CareerBuilder and DoubleClick) do not sell or rent any information to third parties. 

Occasionally CareerBuilder.com polls its users via online surveys or run contests in which we ask visitors for demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). The data that is collected is used to tailor our visitor's experience at our site. This information will not be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties. It may be shared with advertisers only on an aggregate basis. 

**Cookies**   
Cookies are small text files a Web site can use to recognize a repeat visitor to its site. Cookies are not programs that come onto a user's system and damage files. DoubleClick's cookie contains no information about you--only a unique number with no meaning whatsoever outside of CareerBuilder. CareerBuilder/DoubleClick use this number for tracking ad effectiveness. 

One of the other ways in which we use Cookies is to keep track of the ways in which all our users use our Web site. This behavioral information may be provided to deliver targeted advertisements about our products and services. No personal identifying information about our users is passed on anyone at any time. 

**Opt Out Policy**   
While we believe that cookies enhance the Web experience for the user by limiting the repetitiveness of advertising and increasing the level of relevant content on the Web, they are not essential. If you do not want the benefits of cookies, there is a simple procedure, available at AdChoices that allows you, the user, to deny or accept this feature. 

While some third parties offer programs to manually delete your cookies, DoubleClick goes one step further by offering you a "blank" or "opt-out cookie," available at [AdChoices](http://www.adchoices.com/), to prevent any data from being stored. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. 

**Contacting the Web Site**   
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact us at [info@careerbuilder.com](mailto:info@careerbuilder.com).
