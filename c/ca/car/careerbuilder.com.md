# CareerBuilder Privacy Statement

**Confidentiality**

CareerBuilder does not sell any information provided by the users of the site.

When you respond to a job posting on CareerBuilder, your resume goes directly to the company posting the job. CareerBuilder never reviews your resumes. 

E-mail addresses submitted to CareerBuilder (i.e. registering a Personal Search Agent) are kept confidential and will not be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties. 

Occasionally, CareerBuilder polls its users via online surveys or runs contests in which we ask visitors for demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). The data collected is used to enhance your experience at our site. The information is never sold or distributed to third parties. 

**Our Resume Database**

**Opt In/ Opt Out**

Some people only want to store their resume(s) on career sites in order to facilitate applying for a job with a few clicks. Others want to receive as much exposure as possible by allowing all employers to view their resume and professional information. 

You may choose to make a resume private by placing it in a private resume folder. Here, your resume is protected in a secure database, free from Web crawlers and data miners. 

If you do choose to develop your own resume Web page, please understand that you are doing so in a public space which makes your resume accessible to Web crawlers and data miners. 

**Select Blocking**

Prevent certain employer network companies from viewing a resume. New companies are added frequently and it is your responsibility to continue to check back on occasion to ensure that the list of companies that you block is current. 

**Deletion Deactivation**

Remove your information and resume from the resume database at any time. 

Please be sure to revisit these privacy guidelines as they may change from time to time. 

Please contact us with any questions about our Privacy Statement or with any privacy concerns about the site.
