# CareerBuilder Privacy Statement

### CareerBuilder, Inc.  
Privacy Statement

Your privacy, and the privacy of all users of www.careerbuilder.com and the CareerBuilder pages of our network partners' career centers, is important to us. Accordingly, we have adopted the following privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to the protection of your privacy. 

This privacy statement tells you, among other things, what information we gather from you through www.careerbuilder.com and the CareerBuilder pages of our network partners' career centers, how we may use or disclose that information, how you can control the use of your information and our efforts to protect it. 

**_Types of Information Collected_**

In connection with your use of CareerBuilder services, we ask for and may collect information from and about you in different ways. If you are a user of our my careerbuilder™ service, when you register to create your account you provide certain personally-identifying information such as your name and e-mail address. As part of our services, you may submit your resume to be stored on-line with us. In connection with the submission of your resume, we ask you to complete a resume profile through which we collect basic candidate profile information. 

In addition, if you enter any of our contests or sweepstakes, participate in message boards, chat areas, polling activities, electronic commerce or other interactive areas of our site, you may provide general contact information and other information about you. 

We have also contracted with a third party to track your use of our site and that of other subscribing sites on an anonymous basis. To learn more about this tracking service, including how to opt out of the tracking service, please go to [www.privacychoices.org](http://www.privacychoices.org/). 

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally-identifiable information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. 

**_Use of Information_**

Except as described in this privacy statement, CareerBuilder does not sell, rent or provide access to your personal information to third parties. We use the personally identifying information we collect to provide you with account information, to administer our sweepstakes and contests, for site administration, troubleshooting and processing e-commerce transactions. As part of the my careerbuilder™ service, we use your information to send you periodic e-mails informing you of technical service issues, customer satisfaction surveys and account updates. We consider these e-mails essential to the my careerbuilder™ service. Therefore, you will not be able to elect not to receive these e-mails. 

In addition, we may use your e-mail address to contact you regarding our services or products that we believe may be of interest to you and to send you career newsletters. 

CareerBuilder may share your information with trusted partners to perform functions on our behalf, such as sending e-mail communications to you. All such third parties are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide services to CareerBuilder. 

**_Disclosure of Information_**

When you access our services through co-branded career pages, such as those of a CareerBuilder network partner, your personal information may be disclosed to and become the property of CareerBuilder and/or the respective company. Under these circumstances, the use of your personal information may be subject to the privacy policy of that company. Prior to providing personal information, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these sites. CareerBuilder is not responsible for their use of your personal information. 

From time to time, we may also disclose personally identifiable information to fulfill certain legal and regulatory requirements or if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or to prevent or mitigate harm. If we, or one of our lines of business, are transferred or acquired, personally identifiable information may be included among the transferred assets, but only if such transfer is to an entity that uses the information to provide recruitment services. 

**_Use of Cookies_**

CareerBuilder uses "cookies" to enhance your online experience. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, when you register for my careerbuilder™, a cookie helps CareerBuilder recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of logging into your account and eliminates the need to enter your e-mail address each time you visit my careerbuilder™. 

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you have the option of setting your browser to decline cookies if you prefer. 

**_Control of Information_**

You may choose to restrict the use of your information. If you are a user of our my careerbuilder™ service, you have the option of placing your resume in our database. Some users elect to store their resumes on the service in order to facilitate applying for jobs, while others elect to make their resume and profile information searchable by employers to receive the maximum amount of exposure possible. You may choose to remove your resume from our database at any time. 

You may stop the delivery of career newsletters and any promotional e-mail from CareerBuilder by following the specific instructions in the email you receive. We will not send unsolicited messages to users of CareerBuilder services who indicate that they do not wish to receive such messages. 

**_Security of Information_**

Your account containing your resume, profile and registration information is password protected. Only you, or third parties you provide your password to, can access your account. 

Please remember that you play a valuable part in security as well. After you have finished using your account, you should log off and exit your browser so no unauthorized persons can access your account information. Furthermore, if you provide any information to parties who operate web sites that are linked to or from our site, or our network partners' career centers, or which frame our network partners' career centers, different rules may apply to their collection, use or disclosure of your personal information. We encourage you to review these sites' privacy policies before revealing any sensitive or personal information. 

Finally, you should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e. g., user name, e-mail address, or other messages) on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond our control. 

**_Policy Changes_**

It may be necessary from time to time for us to modify this privacy statement to reflect changes in the way we collect and use information or changes in privacy-related laws, regulations, and industry standards. Accordingly, we reserve the right to change this privacy statement at any time by posting the revised policy on this web site. Information will be handled according to the privacy statement in effect at the time the information is used. Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. 

**_Governing Law_**

This privacy statement and the use of this site are governed by Virginia law. Any claim related to the Site or this privacy statement shall be brought in a federal or state court in the Northern District of Virginia, within one year after the claim arises. Users of www.careerbuilder.com and the CareerBuilder pages of our network partners' career centers consent to the jurisdiction of such court as the most convenient and appropriate for the resolution of disputes concerning this privacy statement.
