## WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT ME IS COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE?

We collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information (See Section on Web Beacons).

## Personally Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information is information that allows you to enroll and receive benefits in the Debt Management Programs (DMP) offered by the CCA's through this Website. During the online enrollment process we collect a wide variety of personal and financial data.

Such Personally Identifiable Information may include:

  * Debt Information (Credit Card / Loan Account Numbers & Balances)
  * Personal Information (Social Security Number, Address, Phone, Email, Salary, Pay Period, Employer, Occupation)
  * Demographic Information (Age, Birth Date, Gender)
  * Budget Information (Assets, Monthly Expenses, Other Income)



This information is stored to use in enrolling Users in a DMP. Debt information is used to qualify the User for the program and to make payments on the User's behalf. Budget information is collected to provide the User an overview of where Users' money is spent and is required by the Creditors. The data for those Users who do not complete the online Enrollment process is kept for internal analysis only.

## DOES OUR WEBSITE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE?

We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. Our Website is not designed for or directed to children under the age of 13. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13. We urge all parents or guardians to participate in their children's exploration of the Internet, and to teach their children about protecting their personal information while online.

## WHAT DOES OUR WEBSITE DO WITH THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS?

In general, we use the information collected on our Website to help us understand who uses our Website and how it is used, to personalize your online experience, to complete your enrollment in a DMP, to assist you in using our Online Services, and to improve our Website.

If you become a registered User of our Website, we may use your information to send you a welcoming email that may confirm your User name and password. We may send you electronic newsletters, contact you about products, services, information and news that may be of interest to you, and provide you with targeted feedback.

## Opt-out Policy

If you prefer that we do not send you email communications, you may opt-out of those services, that is, you may direct us not to use your email address as part of our marketing efforts for new products and services. If you wish to opt-out of email communications, you may do so by emailing [customerservice@careonecredit.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20070820004609id_/http%3A//www.careonecredit.com/Help/EmailUs.aspx?emailTo=customerservice@careonecredit.com&subject=Opt-Out%20of%20Email%20Communications) , or by replying to an existing email with your request to be removed from the mailing list or [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20070820004609id_/http%3A//www.careonecredit.com/Help/EmailUs.aspx?emailTo=customerservice@careonecredit.com&subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Opt-Out) . In addition, if you identify yourself to us by sending us an email with questions or comments, we may use your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to respond to your questions or comments, and we may file your questions or comments for future reference.

We may also use the information gathered on our Website to perform statistical analysis of User behavior, to analyze and evaluate issues relating to your DMP, enrollment behavior and credit education, or to evaluate and improve our Online Services. We may link some of this information to Personally Identifiable Information for internal purposes only or to assist you in your debt reduction efforts.

## WHEN DOES OUR WEBSITE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES?

Personally identifiable information about you will be disclosed to third parties only as described in the Gramm Leach Bliley Act Privacy Notice of the CCA that will administer your DMP. This Privacy Notice will be provided to you on our Website during the online Enrollment process. The Privacy Notice discloses that all of the information collected on our Website may be disclosed (both to affiliates and to non-affiliates) unless you tell the CCA not to (called "opt out"). We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website. For example, to third parties with your consent or at your direction or if disclosure is necessary to effect, administer, or enforce the DMP and to other financial institutions with whom the CCA has joint marketing agreements. To review the full Privacy Notice of each CCA for all of the details and directions on how to "opt out" [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20070820004609id_/http%3A//www.careonecredit.com/AboutUs/ServiceProviders.aspx). 3Ci does not disclose any information about you to third parties.

## DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY WHEN I LINK TO OTHER WEBSITES?

Our Website contains links to other websites not owned or operated by us (for example, if you "click" on a partner link, you will likely be taken off our Website). We will attempt to make it obvious to you when you leave our Website and enter these websites by opening a new browser or otherwise notifying you that you are leaving our Website. However, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites. We encourage you to be aware when our Website links to other websites and to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Website.

## IS THE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE SECURE?

We want your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to remain as secure as possible. We strive to provide secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques. To help ensure the integrity and privacy of the Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us via the Internet, at the time you elect to enroll in our Debt Management Program, we use Secured Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in transmitting such Personally Identifiable Information over the Internet to our servers. We secure the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on servers located in controlled, secure environments, protected from unauthorized access, use, or alteration. Only employees who need access to your information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such information. No personal data is ever stored on our web servers. Sensitive information is encrypted within our database, to ensure internal security. In addition, all of our employees must abide by this Privacy Policy and are kept up-to-date on security practices. Any employee who violates this Privacy Policy is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Notwithstanding the above commitments to protect your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) from loss, misuse or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

## WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING THE COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?

You may "opt out" of sharing your personally identifiable information with affiliated and non-affiliated companies as explained in the CCA Privacy Notice provided to you on our Website during the online Enrollment process. To review the full Privacy Notice of each CCA for all of the details and directions on how to "opt out" [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20070820004609id_/http%3A//www.careonecredit.com/AboutUs/ServiceProviders.aspx).

## CAN I UPDATE OR CORRECT MY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?

You can always contact us in order to update, correct or delete your Personally Identifiable Information or change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us by calling Customer Services at 1-800-699-5688. Such updates, corrections and deletions will not have an effect on the data we are required to maintain by the Creditors and CCAs in order to administer the DMP.

Current customers participating in the online DMP can view, update or change their personal, contact and occupational information by selecting the Member Login navigation link off the Website home page, or by contacting Customer Service at 1-800-699-5688. You may also change your debt or budget information by contacting Customer Service as well.

You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your Personally Identifiable Information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. We promise that promptly after receiving your request, all Personally Identifiable Information stored in marketing databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practicable.
