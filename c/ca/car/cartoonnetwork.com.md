# Cartoon Network: Privacy Information

| **Mission**  
Cartoon Network is fully committed to providing a fun, entertaining, and safe web site for people of all ages. CartoonNetwork.com supports and intends to comply with the privacy guidelines developed by the Online Privacy Alliance and the Children's Advertising Review Unit’s (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. The CARU guidelines and our policy aim at "respecting and fostering the parents' role in providing guidance for their children." Because we want our audience to feel comfortable exploring the content offered on CartoonNetwork.com, this Online Safety & Privacy Policy outlines and clarifies how we collect and use information online, our advertising policies, and the safeguards we recommend to ensure a fun and safe web experience. As new technology and online standards evolve, we may modify these policies to better address your concerns.

**Data Collection**  
CartoonNetwork.com does not sell or distribute any information obtained from our visitors to a third party, under any circumstance. We give parents (of children under the age of 13) notice via email when we collect information (email addresses or any other) from their child. For visitors over 13 years of age, we may collect information, with the user’s permission, that will be used to improve your experience on CartoonNetwork.com (example: online survey).

Currently, there are three ways that CartoonNetwork.com collects information online:  
1\. Sweepstakes and contests  
2\. Voluntary submissions via email  
3\. Cookie technology

**Sweepstakes and Contests**  
CartoonNetwork.com strives to create imaginative online contests or promotions. We do this because, well, it’s fun. However, before entering a Cartoon Network contest online, we require kids to ask a parent for permission. To enter online, we will ask for an email address or AOL screen name. Children under 13 years of age are required to enter their parent’s email address as well. This is done so that we may contact a parent via email to notify them that their child has entered a Cartoon Network contest and give them the option to remove the child’s email address from the list of other entries. Sometimes we may also require a visitor to provide us additional information that is not personally identifiable. For example, we might ask you to tell us your favorite character or answer a trivia question. 

The email address is only used to contact you if you have won. It is not collected or stored in any database to contact you at a future time. Once a winner has been selected, that person will be contacted via the winner’s email address given at time of entry. If the email address has changed or been deleted or is no longer operational, the entry will become void. Cartoon Network will not be held responsible for invalid email addresses. The winner will receive a notification letter via email that must be filled out and signed by a parent and returned through the U.S. Postal mail or specified fax number. Once the letter has been received, the prize will be awarded. In the event the letter is not returned by the specified deadline, the prize may be awarded to another entrant.

**Voluntary Submissions via Email**  
Cartoon Network enjoys interacting with its audience. Therefore, there will be opportunities for visitors to contact us online. These currently include Mail Bag, Your 2 Cents, and the Feedback Button. In these areas, an email address will be collected, and in some cases, you may receive a response. 

In addition, sometimes you will have the choice to select the option to subscribe to a free online newsletter sent to the email address you provide. The newsletter will have fun, informative updates about CartoonNetwork.com. When a child under 13 years of age requests this newsletter, we collect their email address as well as their parent’s email address. A notification will be sent to the parent informing them that the child requested a free newsletter that will be sent to the child’s email account. The parent can request at any time, through the options described in the notification, how to un-subscribe their child from this newsletter. In addition, each time the newsletter is emailed, directions will clearly be stated how to remove oneself from the email newsletter.

Under no circumstances, will your email address be provided to any third parties. Again, we require children to get parental permission before using these areas. 

**Cookies: the non-edible kind**  
Cookies are little, tiny pieces of information that your browser stores on your computer, like what browser you're using or what operating system you use. At CartoonNetwork.com, we use cookies to help make your experience better and understand how well we're doing. We only use cookies so we know how many visitors we have and how often they visit: that's the best way to know if you like what we're doing. Under no circumstances do we use cookies to collect or cross-relate personal information about you. 

**Secure Server**  
CartoonNetwork.com has a secure server which transmits the data, scrambles it and decodes it on our end. This is the best form of web technology available to protect that your information is not captured by an outside user. 

When you enter your email address or AOL® screen name for online contests on CartoonNetwork.com, this information is collected through a secure server. This information gets translated or encrypted with a complicated code by your browser, sent to our server, translated back into what you sent, and passed on to us. That way, no one can tell anything about you by listening in on our conversation: it's all encrypted and super secret.

You'll know it's working when you see the little key icon at the bottom of the browser's screen turn a solid blue. The solid key means your connection to our server is encrypted and secure.

**Bulletin Boards and Chat Rooms on America Online®**  
On our site on America Online®, Cartoon Network offers visitors the opportunity to participate in our online community activities. These currently include our bulletin boards and chat rooms. All Cartoon Network community areas on AOL® are monitored to maintain a safe and fun environment. In addition, parents can control access a child has on AOL by going to keyword "parental controls," where they can select the areas in which their child may participate.

**Advertising on CartoonNetwork.com**  
It is very important to Cartoon Network that we help our audience, especially children, to be able to distinguish advertisements and promotional material. We have made efforts to create easy-to-understand notices that are clearly displayed on all advertising and promotional material on our site. In addition, all advertising banners will have the word "ad" or "advertisement" as part of its space.

While visiting CartoonNetwork.com, advertisement banners will appear at the top of most of the pages on the screen. Many of these advertisement banners come from companies who want to tell the visitor about their goods and services. Other banners will be messages from CartoonNetwork.com telling the visitor about some features on our site or about our television network. By clicking on one of these banners, it will automatically go to a page which gives more information related to the banner. CartoonNetwork.com carefully screens all sponsor’s sites before linking to them. Of course, web sites and addresses change regularly, and we cannot guarantee the content of every place we link to.

In addition, Cartoon Network.com will be providing you special programming created by us that has been supported by our sponsors. This type of advertising will be clearly identified as being "presented by" or "sponsored by" a particular sponsor. In some cases, there will be a link to the sponsor’s web site.

**Safeguards**  
**Monitor Your Child’s Internet Usage**  
As we have taken special precautions to help aide in the safety of your child’s World Wide Web experience, we ask parents to closely monitor the Internet activities of their children and become educated on the various Internet and software tools available to help ensure that their child has a fun and satisfying on-line experience. You can visit your local computer store retailer for more information on these products.

**America Online® Parental Controls**  
America Online® has established a technology on their online service which allows parents to control and restrict the areas their children can go to not only on AOL, but on the Internet as well. AOL subscribers can go to keyword "parental controls" to find out more information.
