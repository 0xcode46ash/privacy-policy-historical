# Cartoon Network: Privacy Information

| **CartoonNetwork.com's Privacy Policy**

CartoonNetwork.com is committed to providing a fun, entertaining, and safe web site for people of all ages. We are dedicated to safeguarding any personal information collected online and to helping parents and children learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet. Because many of the visitors to this site are children, we take care that our content is suitable for children. In addition, we take special measures to help children protect their privacy while online. For example, we do not ask children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in a particular activity, and we take efforts to prevent children from posting contact information. 

To help ensure a rewarding online experience for our visitors - and for the parents of our visitors who are children - we provide you with this summary of our information practices. This privacy notice governs the collection and use of information at CartoonNetwork.com, a Time Warner. 

As we continue to offer our visitors new and different types of content and services, we may modify our practices from time to time. However, we will treat all personal information we collect in accordance with the privacy notice in effect at the time the information is collected. 

**I. The Information We Collect**

At CartoonNetwork.com, we do not collect any personally identifiable information unless our visitors voluntarily provide it to us. For some of our online activities - such as polls or surveys - we may ask our visitors to provide information that is not personally identifiable. This might include first name, city or state of residence, age, and gender, or a visitor's favorite cartoon character. To enable our visitors to participate in some of our other online activities - such as entering contests or sweepstakes or receiving email newsletters - we may ask them to provide personal information, such as full name and e-mail address. 

When a child under 13 enters a contest or sweepstakes or asks to receive our email newsletter, we will also ask for a parent's email address so that we can notify the parent that we have received personal information from the child. We do not knowingly collect names and email addresses from children under 13 without notifying the parent via email and giving them the opportunity to remove their child's name from the list of entries. Winners of our contests or sweepstakes are notified by email, and are required to send us by fax or regular mail a form containing their street address. Winners who are minors must have the form signed by a parent in order to receive their prizes. 

When visitors come to our site, we automatically collect some non-personally identifiable information such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS) and browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) being used, and the domain name of the Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink). 

**II. How We Use the Information**

We use visitors' personal information only for our internal purposes of enabling visitors to enter one of our online contests or sweepstakes or to subscribe to our online newsletter. We use the email addresses of parents to notify them when we have received information from their children and to give them the opportunity to have their child's name removed from our lists. 

We do not keep any personal information we obtain through a contest or sweepstakes after the particular event is completed. We use the names and email addresses of subscribers to our email newsletter only to send them the newsletter. Each newsletter contains instructions on how to be removed from the subscription list by sending us a return email. 

We never sell, rent, or otherwise share our visitors' personal information with third parties. Sometimes, we will use agents or contractors to help us provide services to our visitors, such as helping us conduct a sweepstakes and sending prizes to the winners. In these cases, we require the agent or contractor to keep the information confidential and to use it only for the specific services they are performing. 

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site, to personalize our visitors' experience on CartoonNetwork.com, and to offer products, programs, and services. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services. 

We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request.

We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information in ways that are materially different from the ones described above without also providing parental notification of such practices and obtaining consent for any materially different uses. 

**III. Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors**

Our site contains links to other sites, including those of sponsors and advertisers, whose information practices may be different from ours. Sometimes, the other sites might conduct contests or sweepstakes that are promoted on Cartoon Network or CartoonNetwork.com. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices, since those sites are not covered by our privacy policy and may follow procedures that are different from ours. 

**IV. Cookies**

CartoonNetwork.com uses a software technology called "cookies." Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information. Although cookies could enable us to relate a visitor's use of this Web site to personal information that a visitor has provided, such as an email address, we do not use them for this purpose. We do use "cookies" to determine how many visitors we have and how often they visit various sections of our site. 

**V. Security**

We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.

**VI. Parental Review of Information**

**VIII. A Final Note to Parents**

The Internet offers a world of opportunity for children. Your guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience. We encourage you to the visit The Direct Marketing Association's web site ([www.the-dma.org](http://www.the-dma.org/)) and explore the Get CyberSavvy! Program. Get CyberSavvy! helps families learn how information flows online so they can use the Internet in ways that protect their privacy and well-being. It also contains a number of valuable resources to help parents and children be aware of and express their preferences about information that is collected online and how it is used. Your efforts to instill responsible information practices will help steer your children to age-appropriate sites, and will go a long way toward ensuring that your children have enriching experiences online.
