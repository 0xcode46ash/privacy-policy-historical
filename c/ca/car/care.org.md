# CARE Privacy Statement

**Credit Card Security**

CARE is grateful for the donations that help us continue our valuable work. It is very important to us that your personal information remain secure. When you donate to CARE online, your credit card information is secured by a reputable security company (Verisign). Also, your credit card number is used only for that particular transaction and is not stored. You will see the "closed" lock symbol in the lower part of your browser screen (often times it is yellow as well) when you are on our secure donation pages. You will also notice in your web site address bar that the domain name starts with an "https" on those donation pages. This means that information entered on those pages is encrypted for your security. This actually makes it more secure than using a credit card in physical form at a store for example. If you have any questions regarding the security of your credit card donation online, please e-mail [info@care.org](mailto:info@care.org), or call **1-800-422-7385** for more information.

**Domain Name**

CARE's Web server automatically recognizes, but does not collect or use your domain name (IP address). CARE anonymously tracks your visit in order to compile statistical information about the use of our Web site. We do not collect individual information about you or your personal use of this site. Cookie use: A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Some Web sites use cookies to collect detailed personal user information. CARE uses cookies only to see if you are a return visitor, or to allow our online community to recognize you as an existing member. We do not use cookies to surreptitiously collect any personal information from your computer.

**Email Addresses**

Our Web site does not automatically recognize your e-mail address. We ask for your e-mail address on a number of pages within our site, but you may opt out of e-mail communications at any time by un-checking the box beneath where you entered in your e-mail address, or by clicking the unsubscribe link that is included at the bottom of every e-mail communication from CARE. You may also call us at any time at **1-800-422-7385** , or e-mail us at [info@care.org](mailto:info@care.org), to be removed.

**Other Personal Information**

You are not required to provide any personal information on our Web site unless you choose to do so. We do ask for personal information on our online donation pages to properly enable donation transaction processing. We use this information to acknowledge receipt of your donation for tax purposes. If you give a gift to CARE your name and address will be placed on our physical mailing list for occasional (quarterly) mail updates. If you do not wish to receive physical mail from CARE you may call us at any time at **1-800-422-7385** , or e-mail us at [info@care.org](mailto:info@care.org), to be removed. If you are making a donation in honor of or in memory of someone, we will not use their personal information for any purpose other than sending the acknowledgement card.

We make postal addresses and telephone numbers available to other reputable nonprofit and commercial organizations. If you do not want us to share this information you may call us at any time at **1-800-422-7385** , or e-mail us at [info@care.org](mailto:info@care.org), to have your name removed. CARE does not share your e-mail address with any third parties unless explicitly mentioned at the time of e-mail opt-in.
