# CARE Privacy Statement

**Credit Card Security**

CARE is grateful for the donations that help us continue our valuable work. It is very important to us that your personal information remain secure. When you donate to CARE online, your credit card information is secured by a reputable security company (PayPal, formerly known as Verisign). Also, your credit card number is used only for that particular transaction and is not stored. You will see the "closed" lock symbol in the lower part of your browser screen (often times it is yellow as well) when you are on our secure donation pages. You will also notice in your web site address bar that the domain name starts with an "https" on those donation pages. This means that information entered on those pages is encrypted for your security. This actually makes it more secure than using a credit card in physical form at a store for example. If you have any questions regarding the security of your credit card donation online, [please e-mail us](https://web.archive.org/feedback), or call **1-800-422-7385** for more information.

**Cookie Useage**

CARE uses cookies to facilitate authentication and personalization across our web systems. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your Web browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. CARE uses only anonymous information (such as IP address) to track how our online visitors use our website. This data is sometimes stored using cookies.

In addition, we occasionally use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our site and services. They may also use information about your transactions and visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag and cookies, which are industry standard technologies used by most major web sites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, email address, or any personally identifying information about the user. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party service provider, please [click here](http://www.akamai.com/html/policies/privacy_statement.html#policy_opt_out).

**Email Addresses**

We ask for your e-mail address on a number of pages within our site, but you may opt out of e-mail communications at any time by un-checking the box beneath where you entered in your e-mail address, by clicking the unsubscribe link that is included at the bottom of every e-mail communication from CARE, by selecting "No" when presented with whether or not you would like to receive email from CARE, or by [logging in and editing to your Personal Profile](http://my.care.org/profile) at any time and unchecking the box that indicates you would like to receive email located there. You may also call us at any time at 1-800-422-7385, or [e-mail us](https://web.archive.org/feedback), to be removed from our email distribution list.

**Other Personal Information**

You are not required to provide any personal information on our Web site unless you choose to do so. We do ask for personal information on our online donation pages to properly enable donation transaction processing. We use this information to acknowledge receipt of your donation for tax purposes and to help prevent fraudulent donations. If you give a gift to CARE your name and address will be placed on our physical mailing list for occasional (quarterly) mail updates. If you do not wish to receive physical mail from CARE you may call us at any time at 1-800-422-7385, or [e-mail us](https://web.archive.org/feedback), to be removed. If you are making a donation in honor of or in memory of someone, we will not use their personal information for any purpose other than sending the acknowledgement card.

We make postal addresses and telephone numbers available to other reputable nonprofit and commercial organizations. If you do not want us to share this information you may call us at any time at 1-800-422-7385, or [e-mail us](https://web.archive.org/feedback), to have your name removed. CARE does not share your e-mail address with any third parties unless explicitly mentioned at the time of e-mail opt-in.
