We have selected an outside company, Coremetrics, to assist us in better understanding how people use our site. Cookies will be placed on your computer to collect personal information. The information that is collected through these cookies tells us things like which search engine referred you, how you navigated around our site, what you browsed and purchased and what traffic is driven by banner ads and emails. Carhartt.com does not allow Coremetrics to collect credit card, username or password information.

Coremetrics may only use your personal information to perform services for us. It may not share your personal information with anyone else, or use it for any other purpose, except on an aggregate, non-personal basis (in other words, the information will not be identified with you). Coremetrics is required to maintain all of the information it collects and analyzes securely and in confidence. You may choose to opt-out of Coremetrics' analysis of your browsing and purchasing behavior, [by clicking here](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217055950id_/http%3A//www.carhartt.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/PrivacySettingsView?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10101).

 **How We Use Email**

When you provide us your email address, we may send you emails related to processing your order or to respond to a request. For example, after you place an order at carhartt.com, you will receive an email confirmation and, in most cases, an email with package tracking information.

It is our intent to send you promotional email (our Email Newsletter) only if you have agreed to receive it. Instructions on how to unsubscribe are included in each edition of the newsletter.

If you decide to participate in our research panel(s) your email address will be used to send you surveys periodically.

 **Security**

In our efforts to protect your information, Carhartt uses a variety of technical safeguards, such as firewalls, and we physically secure our servers.

In addition, when you make a purchase, request a catalog, or create an account on our website, your information is transmitted in an encrypted format.

Our website is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

From time to time, we may use customer information for unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy policy notice. Before our information practices change, we will post these changes on our website. We encourage you to review our privacy policy periodically.
