# Caribbean Jobs - Caribbean Jobs Privacy Policy

****  
**Overview**  
****  
  
CaribbeanJobs.com is fully committed to protecting the privacy of the users of our Site. This Policy outlines this commitment to you, as we want to be able to provide you with a user experience that is safe and secure. We want to ensure to our best efforts that any information you give us remains private and is used only for the purposes outlined in this Policy. Please note that by using our site, you acknowledge that you agree with the terms of our Privacy Policy. 

A user can access our website, CaribbeanJobs.com (the 'site') and utilise many of our services without providing any information to us at all. Nor do we follow a user's browsing path outside of our site. We do develop summary - not individual - reports for our recruiters and advertisers .

**Aggregated Information on all users of CaribbeanJobs.com**  
  
****  
  


We gather information on all users of our site on an aggregated basis. This information is used to analyse what the total usage levels are for the Site, what areas of the site are most popular and what times of the day are most popular for using the site. This information is used to help us decide what improvements we can make to the Site going forward.  
In addition, we may share this information with our clients or potential clients and our partners, but only on an aggregated basis with no individual breakdown, so they receive no information about how you, as an individual, use the site, nor will they be able to identify you personally from the information they receive.  
  
****  
  
**Information about you specifically**  
  
****  
  
In some situations, you may wish to register with CaribbeanJobs.com, e.g. to set-up a 'My Career Manager' account. This will involve you registering personal information such as your name and email address. The information is collected solely for the purpose of personalising your user experience and for delivering the services that you have signed up for. If, at any time, you do not wish to remain a registered user, you can un-subscribe and/or delete your personal information from our databases. 

CaribbeanJobs.com offers you the ability to change at any time the personal information you give during registration.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information back from the browser. The CaribbeanJobs.com site uses cookies to identify users and personalise their visit by customising web pages for them.  
For this reason, some pages may not display correctly if you have disabled cookies on your browser. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.

**Information that is logged on an automatic basis**  
  
****  
  
  
We use your IP address, log user agents and referring address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our site and to identify unique users.   
We will not monitor, edit, or disclose any personal information about you or your internet use without your prior permission unless we believe that such action is required to enforce the law. In this case, data may be passed on to appropriate individuals, organisations or companies, if specifically requested.

**Resume's**  
  
****  
  
On CaribbeanJobs.com you may decide to register your resume in our database. This means that your resume can be found and viewed by recruiters who have paid for access to our Resume Database product. It also means that you can attach it to your online job application. 

You may store your resume in the database. However, your personal identifying details (name, address & email) will not be visible to any recruiter or employer who may access your resume when they search the database. We endeavour to grant access to the Resume database only to recruiters who agree to abide by our Terms and Conditions. However, should a third party gain access to your resume by evading our security measures, we cannot be held responsible. 

You may remove your resume from our database at any time. However, recruiters who have already accessed your resume, may have kept a copy of it in their own files. Please note that we cannot be held responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of your resume in these instances. 

In the interest of your privacy and the maintenance of an up-to-date Resume database, resumes are removed from recruiters' access if they have not been updated for a period of 90 days. If you wish your resume to remain in the searchable database, you must update your details at least once every 90 days.

**Job Alert service**

The Job Alert service matches a jobseeker's requirements for employment with the profile of vacancies advertised on our site. For jobseekers who subscribe to this service, you receive an email listing those jobs that match the criteria you have entered for, by at least 50% based on our ranking system. You decide how often you wish to receive these alerts and you can change your search criteria at any time or unsubscribe at any time.
