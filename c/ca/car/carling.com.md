### HOW WE WILL USE YOUR INFORMATION

All personal information that we obtain about you will be recorded, used, and protected by us in accordance with current data protection legislation, our Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy. We will primarily use your personal information:

  * to provide the services you request from us 
  * to communicate with you in the event that any services you have requested are unavailable for record keeping purposes 
  * to carry out market research so that we can improve the services we offer
