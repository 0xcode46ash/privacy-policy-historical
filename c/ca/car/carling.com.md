In common with many other website operators, we may use standard technology called 'cookies' on this site. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive and they are used to record how you navigate this website on each visit. 

Our cookies are used to enable us to develop our website to reflect our customers interests and by noting who has seen which pages, properties and advertisements (including click through from emails), how frequently particular pages are visited and determining the most popular areas of our website. We may use cookies to enrich your experience of using the website by allowing us to tailor what you see to what we have learned about your preferences during your visits to the site.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent cookies being stored. Please note, if you do turn cookies off this will limit the service that we are able to provide to you and may affect your visitor experience.

### HOW WE WILL USE YOUR INFORMATION

All personal information that we obtain about you will be recorded, used, and protected by us in accordance with current data protection legislation, our Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy. We will primarily use your personal information:

  * to provide the services you request from us 
  * to communicate with you in the event that any services you have requested are unavailable for record keeping purposes 
  * to carry out market research so that we can improve the services we offer 
  * to track and analyse activity on our website 
  * to create an individual profile for you so that we can enhance user experience, understand and respect your preferences and to provide you with relevant offers and opportunities where you have agreed to receive them



In order to provide our products and services to you, we may need to appoint other organisations to carry out some of the processing activities on our behalf. These may include, for example, technology hosts. In these circumstances, we will ensure that your information is properly protected and that it is only used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Disclosing your personal information**

Occasionally, we may need to appoint other organisations to carry out some activities on our behalf. These will include, for example, direct mailing and email marketing services.

If we believe that you are in breach of our terms and conditions we may refer details to our advisers. If we have cause to believe you are acting unlawfully, we may provide details (which may include personal information) to the police and/or regulators.

### MOLSON COORS BREWING COMPANY (UK) LIMITED COMMERCIAL PARTNER PROGRAMME

The Molson Coors Brewing Company (UK) Limited Commercial Partner programme is designed to help our website users to find products and services at competitive prices. The programme includes organisations with which we have a business relationship that have a range of products and services available.

### OFFERS AND OPPORTUNITIES

We and/or our Commercial Partners would like to contact you to tell you more about the offers available to you and about a range of other initiatives in a number of ways, including by post, telephone, text/picture/video message or by email.

If you express an interest in an offer from one of our Commercial Partners, that partner may let us know. This enables us to take your views and interests into account when choosing our Commercial Partners and developing the programme.

### SECURITY

We take the security of your personal information seriously. We have security procedures in place to ensure that our paper and computer systems and databases are protected against unauthorised use, loss and damage. 

### USE OF YOUR INFORMATION OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION

Some of the organisations to which we may disclose your personal information may be situated outside of the European Union. In order to provide you with the products and services you require, we may need to transfer your personal information to these countries some of which do not have laws that protect privacy rights as extensively as in the United Kingdom. If we do transfer your personal information to other territories, we will take proper steps to ensure that your information is protected in accordance with this privacy policy.

### CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

Privacy laws and practice are constantly developing and we aim to meet high standards. Our policies and procedures are, therefore, under continual review.
