**How Information is Used**  
Information you post in public areas of the site or placed in the searchable CV database will be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world. We strive to provide a safe, secure environment by attempting to limit access to our database to legitimate users, but cannot guarantee that unauthorised parties will not gain access. We also cannot control how authorised users store or transfer information downloaded from the database, so you should ensure that you do not post sensitive information to CareerOne.

We use the information you provide us to deliver the products and services we offer, and to operate and improve our sites. Our services may include the display of personalised content and advertising. We may use your information to contact you about CareerOne site updates, conduct surveys, or informational and service-related communications, including important security updates.
