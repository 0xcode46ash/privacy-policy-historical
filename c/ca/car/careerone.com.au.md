## How Information is Used

Information you post in public areas of the site or placed in the searchable CV database will be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world. We strive to provide a safe, secure environment by attempting to limit access to our database to legitimate users, but cannot guarantee that unauthorised parties will not gain access. We also cannot control how authorised users store or transfer information downloaded from the database, so you should ensure that you do not post sensitive information to CareerOne.

We use the information we collect about you to deliver the products and services we offer, and to operate and improve our sites. Our services may include the display of personalised content and advertising. We may use your information to contact you about CareerOne site updates, conduct surveys, or informational and service-related communications, including important security updates.

## Disclosure of Information to Others

We share your information with third parties, including Monster, Inc. and third party technology providers, who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. These third parties may not use that information for any purpose other than assisting us in providing those products and services.

If you have consented for us to do so, we may use your information to contact you about other products or services available from our affiliates.

If you have consented for us to do so, we may also share your information with third parties who may contact you about their products or services.  This includes sharing your information with Acquire Learning Pty Ltd for the purposes of the provision of services by our joint venture, CareerOne Education. Acquire Learning Pty Ltd's privacy policy is available at <http://www.acquirelearning.com.au/privacy-policy>.

If your personal information was previously accessed by others using the Sites, we are unable to delete the information from their systems.

Monster has no control over the information that Ad Networks or other third parties may have about you. We encourage you to visit their web sites and review and read the privacy policies and opt-out practices that govern their usage.
