We encourage you to review our [ full Privacy Policy](http://inside.careerone.com.au/fullpolicy/inside2.aspx) for detailed information on our privacy practices.

CareerOne collects information about you and uses this information to help you connect with employers and job seekers and to provide other services to you. This privacy policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, shared, and secured, as well as your choices regarding use, access, and correction of your personal information.

## Scope of this Privacy Policy

CareerOne collects the [personal](http://inside.careerone.com.au/fullpolicy/inside2.aspx#personal "personal") and [demographic](http://inside.careerone.com.au/fullpolicy/inside2.aspx#demographic "demographic") information you choose to provide us. We also collect information about how you use our sites and the areas of our site that you visit. We may also acquire information about you from third parties in order to further personalise your experience. The resulting logs contain information necessary for analysing the use of resources, troubleshooting problems, and improving services. We also use [cookies](http://inside.careerone.com.au/fullpolicy/inside2.aspx#cookiesbeacons "cookies") and [web beacons](http://inside.careerone.com.au/fullpolicy/inside2.aspx#cookiesbeacons "web beacons").

## How We Use Information

Information you post in public areas of the site or placed in the searchable CV database will be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world. We strive to provide a safe, secure environment by attempting to limit access to our database to legitimate users, but cannot guarantee that unauthorised parties will not gain access. We also cannot control how authorised users store or transfer information downloaded from the database, so you should ensure that you do not post sensitive information to CareerOne.

We use the information we collect about you to deliver the products and services we offer, and to operate and improve our sites. Our services may include the display of personalised content and advertising. We may use your information to contact you about CareerOne site updates, conduct surveys, or informational and service-related communications, including important security updates. In addition, unless you tell us otherwise then we will also contact you (including via telephone) about enrolling in education and training courses with our third party education provider partners. If you do not want to be contacted for these purposes, please let us know by contacting us via email [optout@careeronerecruit.com.au](mailto:optout@careeronerecruit.com.au) or via the other methods provided at the bottom of this policy.

## Disclosure of Information to Others

We share your information with third parties, including Monster, Inc. and third party technology providers, who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. Unless you tell us otherwise, we will share your information with third parties who may contact you to market their products and services. However if you opt-out, then these third parties may not use your information for any purpose other than assisting us in providing those products and services.

Unless you tell us otherwise, we may use your information to contact you about other products or services available from our affiliates.

Unless you tell us otherwise, we may also share your information with third parties who may contact you about their products or services.

You may review, correct, or delete the personal information you submit to us at any time. Simply [log into your account](http://my.careerone.com.au/Login.aspx "log into your account"), go to your account profile, and make the necessary changes. We will delete your personal information, but will retain logs, demographic and statistical information about you and keep an archival copy of your information in an anonymised form. If your personal information was previously accessed by others using the Sites, we are unable to delete the information from their systems.

Monster has no control over the information that Ad Networks or other third parties may have about you. We encourage you to visit their web sites and review and read the privacy policies and opt-out practices that govern their usage.

If you change your mind about receiving communications from CareerOne or other parties, you may change your preferences by logging into your account.
