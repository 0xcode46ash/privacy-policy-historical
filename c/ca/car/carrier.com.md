### Privacy Policy

If you feel that this company is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should first contact [privacy.admin@carrier.com](mailto:privacy.admin@carrier.com)

This policy covers how Carrier Corporation collects and treats information received via its web site. Such information may include information like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and other personal indicia.

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Carrier Corporation does not own or control, or to people that Carrier Corporation does not employ or manage. In addition, certain Carrier Corporation associated companies such as United Technologies have their own privacy statements which can be viewed by clicking on the links.

## Information Collection and Use

Carrier Corporation will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Carrier Corporation collects information from our users at several different points on our web site.

## Registration, Become a Dealer and Contact Forms

Some portions of the web site may request that a user complete a registration form.  A user has the option to register at the [www.carrier.com](http://www.residential.carrier.com/) web site for personalized service (site registration) and must first complete the registration form. During site registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address, and may select areas of interest). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest and to personalize their future visits.

A user also has the option to register their products via the web sites ( **product registration** ). During product registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name, address, and email address) and the model and serial number of the product being registered. Optional demographic information may also be collected.

A user has the option to submit a question or concern via the web sites using a  **customer service / contact form**. The user is required to provide name and email address and contact information so that we can answer their question or request. Also, the customer service / contact form may also be routed to our 3rd party service provider, Alert Communications, who assists Carrier Corporation in answering customer requests from our web sites.

A user has the option to request that Carrier contact them regarding how to  **become a Carrier dealer**  on the residential.carrier.com web site.  The user is required to provide name, email address and other contact information so that we can respond to their request.

Site registration, product registration, become a dealer, and customer service/contact form information is collected by Carrier Corporation. An automatic email confirmation is sent to the user when they submit each of these forms (except the feedback form).

## Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's machine containing information about the user. By having our site set a cookie the user would not have to enter their personal information more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site; for example, the user will not receive personalized service. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site.

## Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Log files capture the cookie ID and IP address but are not linked in the web traffic analysis.

## Sharing

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We use an outside shipping company to ship product orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for products, and an outside company to provide on-line financing application and approval for some of our products. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

We partner with other parties to provide specific web related services. When the user uses these services on our web site, we will only share names, or other information that is necessary for the third party to provide the service. Services include online surveys, search, dealer locators, “contact us” or “customer service” forms. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing the requested services.

## Employment

You may submit your on-line [employment resume](http://www.global.carrier.com/details/0,,CLI1_DIV28_ETI33,00.html) in any of three ways. From our employment section, your email to [great.jobs@carrier.utc.com](mailto:great.jobs@carrier.utc.com) will email your information directly to Carrier Corporation. If you use our "Job Listings" or "U.S. Job Openings" links, you will be linked to the job site listing of Carrier Corporation job openings. Also, you may choose to "Apply on-line" to one of our jobs by logging into the appropriate job site.  


## Orders

When you place an order for promotional merchandise, Carrier automatically redirects you to our suppliers' web sites. These suppliers provide the storefront services and you become a customer of these respective suppliers. Please refer to the suppliers' privacy policies for complete details.

## Links

Carrier Corporation's web sites contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Carrier Corporation is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

## Surveys

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested includes user information (email address, such as visitor or customer type, reason for purchase) and demographic information (zip code, age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site, and better understanding customer demographics.

## Security

This web site takes stringent precautions to protect our users' information.  When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with encryption software, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also have stringent protection policies for protecting user information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

If you have any questions about the security at our web site, you can send an email to [privacy.admin@carrier.com](mailto:privacy.admin@carrier.com).

## Supplementation of Information

In order for Carrier Corporation to better understand customer demographics, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. In order for Carrier Corporation's web site to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individual's preference, we may combine information about the purchasing habits of users to create an aggregated segmentation of information.

## Newsletter and Special Offers

We send users who register at Carrier Corporation site or register their products a welcoming email to confirm their registration. Registered customers may elect to receive information on products, services, announcements and special offers. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our Choice/Opt-in section below. Users who have provided personal information on Carrier Corporation web sites may occasionally be contacted with product offers if they have elected to receive this information. We will communicate with the user to provide requested services with regards to issues relating to their requests via email or phone.

Also, a user can elect to have us send them an email when a particular out-of-stock product later becomes in stock and available for purchase at [www.buy.carrier.com](http://www.buy.carrier.com/). The user must provide their email address for this service. Carrier Corporation will save the email address and send the user a one-time email as requested, when the product next becomes in stock.

## Correction/Updating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as a zip code or phone number), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done on-line by updating the Carrier Site Registration Form. Product Registrations may be updated at the Carrier Product Registration Form, the Bryant Product Registration Form or the Payne Product Registration Form if previously submitted. Or you can send us a message, by calling or writing Customer Service.

## Choice/Opt-in

Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-in' to having their information used for purposes directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. Our site registration, product registration, literature request and customer contact forms (on [www.carrier.com](http://www.carrier.com/), [www.residential.carrier.com](http://www.residential.carrier.com/) and [www.buy.carrier.com](http://www.buy.carrier.com/)) have 'opt-in' boxes so that users can select to receive product offers or information if they desire. Users may update their site registration, product registration, or customer service selections including the 'opt-in' selection at [www.carrier.com](http://www.carrier.com/) at the following links: Register Your Product, or by contacting Customer Service. Users may also update their 'opt-in' choices at the Bryant Product Registration Form or the Payne Product Registration Form.

If redirection to an external site is required, users of our site also receive a pop-up window to alert them that they are visiting an external site and their information is being collected by an outside party. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.

## Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will prominently post those changes on our web site so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we would notify users by way of an email or by a prominent notice on the web site. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
