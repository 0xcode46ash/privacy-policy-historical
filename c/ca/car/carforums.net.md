# CarForums.net Privacy Policy

****In a nutshell, we won't spam you or giveaway your personal information to anyone without your consent. But you may want to read the fine details but the bottom line is that we're committed to protecting your privacy because we know that without that, there can't be any trust between us within this community.

 **Information Collection and Use**

CarForums.net is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. CarForums.net collects information from our users at several different points on our website including: 

**Registration**

In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user when necessary or when they opt-in to an e-mail list or service provided by a CarForums.net partner. Certain types of demographic information such as zip codes may be collected in some cases but are optional but recommended to help us better personalize CarForums.net for you. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. All CarForums.net partners are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing their services. 

**Links**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that CarForums.net is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Newsletter**

CarForums.net members receive automaticly a newsletter, weekly or bi-weekly. To unsubscribe from this newsletter the member has to unregister from Carforums.net 

**Surveys & Contests**

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

**Tell-A-Friend**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address. CarForums.net will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. CarForums.net stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. 

**Security**

This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

**Site and Service Updates**

We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information:**

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the myProfile page or by emailing our Customer Service. 

**Notification of Changes**

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at our discretion so you may wish to check this page occasionally for changes. 

Thanks, Team Car Forums
