# Privacy Policy | Carnegie Hall

This Website and E-Mail Privacy Policy describes how Carnegie Hall collects, uses, and shares non-personal and personal information when you visit the carnegiehall.org website and when you receive e-mails sent by Carnegie Hall. The effective date of this policy is March 15, 2011.

Please note that this privacy policy does not apply to any websites other than carnegiehall.org, including websites to which you may link from carengiehall.org (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube), or to e-mails that are not sent by Carnegie Hall. You are encouraged to read the privacy policies on other sites and the privacy policies put in place by other e-mail senders for information concerning their privacy practices. 

**1\. Information That We Collect**

 **A. Non-Personal Information**

When you visit the carnegiehall.org site, we collect the IP address of the device you use to connect to the internet. In addition, we gather information about the type of browser you are using (including the specific version), the type of operating system you have on your computer, and from which site you came.

When you browse our site or receive one of our e-mails, Carnegie Hall uses cookies and/or web beacons (sometimes referred to as “pixel tags”) to collect information and store your online preferences. Cookies are widely used and most browsers are set up to accept them automatically. If you would prefer, you can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it, or set your browser to automatically block any cookies. Please note that if you decide to set your browser to block cookies, some features and services on our site may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize you. In addition, any offers we may provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.

It is important to note that cookies and web beacons do not capture any information that can personally identify you. The information they gather helps us improve your interactions with the carnegiehall.org site, as well as our communications with you, and may include:

* Your response to one of our e-mails  
* Time and duration of your visit to our site  
* Pages you viewed while on our site

We may also supplement the information we collect with information we receive from other companies. For example, we may use marketing segments developed by us or other companies to customize certain offerings.

 **B. Personal Information**

In addition to the non-personal information described in the previous section, we may also gather personal information that you give us, including your name, address, phone number, and e-mail. For example, we collect personal information when you:

* Purchase tickets online  
* Purchase a membership online  
* Purchase merchandise online  
* Make a donation online  
* Enter a contest online  
* Contact customer support

If we collect personal information directly from you, we may use it alone or in combination with information we acquire about you from third parties, or that is publicly available from other sources, in order to better tailor and personalize our offerings and our communications with you.

Upon your request, we will provide you with access to personal information we have collected from you. You can help Carnegie Hall maintain the accuracy of your personal information by notifying us when you change your address, phone number, or e-mail. To access or update your information, or to stop receiving communications from Carnegie Hall, please contact Carnegie Hall by e-mail at feedback@carnegiehall.org or by postal mail at the following address:

 **2\. Using the Information That We Collect**

 **A. Operation of Our Business and This Website**

Carnegie Hall uses the information we collect about and from you in connection with the operation of our business (for example, to communicate with you concerning events to which you have purchased tickets), and to offer an enhanced, personalized online experience on our site.

The information we collect allows us to:

* Recognize you when you return to our site so we can personalize your experience  
* Process applications and transactions  
* Respond to your requests  
* Provide you with relevant product and service offers on our site and in e-mail advertising

 **B. Sharing Information With Certain Third Parties**

With the exceptions below, we will not share personal information about you with any other entity. 

**a. Our Service Providers**  
We provide your information to third-party companies to perform services on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service, and to assist in our marketing efforts. We direct all such third-party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed to them and not to use your information for any purpose other than to provide services on Carnegie Hall’s behalf.

  **b. Organizers of Concerts and Special Events at Carnegie Hall**  
We share personal information that you give us with third-party organizers of concerts and special events at Carnegie Hall for their direct-marketing purposes, but only if you purchase tickets to their concerts and events.

 **c. Purposes of Safety, Security, and Compliance With the Law**  
Your information and the contents of your private online communications may be accessed and disclosed (i) in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant, or subpoena); (ii) when we have a good-faith belief that we are required to disclose the information in response to legal process; (iii) in other circumstances in which Carnegie Hall believes the carnegiehall.org site is being used in the commission of a crime (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit-risk reduction); (iv) when we have a good-faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or another person; and (v) when necessary either to protect the rights or property of Carnegie Hall, including to enforce our Terms of Service or to render the service you have requested.

 **d. Contest Sponsors**  
We may occasionally present a special contest or promotion on the carnegiehall.org site that is sponsored by a third party. To qualify for entry, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share the personal information we request from you with such sponsor(s), we will notify you on the webpage through which the information is collected.

 **e. In Connection With a Sale or Merger**  
In the event that Carnegie Hall undergoes a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we may transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor organization in such transition. If material changes to Carnegie Hall’s privacy practices will occur as a result of the business transition, we will notify you of the business transition prior to transferring your personal information.

 

 **3\. Our Policies Concerning Children**

We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Any portion of the carnegiehall.org website intended for children under 13 will not request any personal information. In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from children under the age of 13, we will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such information from our records.

 

 **4\. Opting Out of Promotional E-Mails**

You can choose to opt out of receiving additional promotional e-mails from Carnegie Hall by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in any such e-mail, or by submitting such a request by e-mail at feedback@carnegiehall.org or by postal mail at the following address:

Carnegie Hall  
881 Seventh Avenue  
New York, NY 10019  
Attn: Interactive Services

You can also sign in to your online account on carnegiehall.org to opt out of some or all of your e-mail subscriptions.

Please note that once we receive your request, it may take an additional period of time for your opt-out to become effective. Your unsubscribe or e-mail preference change will be processed promptly, within no more than 10 business days.

Note that if you opt out of our promotional communications, we may still e-mail or communicate with you from time to time if we need to provide you with information or if we need to request information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you or for other legitimate non-marketing reasons.

 

 **5\. Security of Your Information**

Carnegie Hall works to protect the security of your information during transmission by using secure sockets layer (sometimes referred to as “SSL”) software, that encrypts information you input. You can further help to ensure your security by taking a few simple precautions. For instance, you should protect against unauthorized access to your Carnegie Hall username and password, and to your computer. You should also be sure to sign off when you have finished using a shared computer.

If you make a purchase through the carnegiehall.org site, we will use your credit card number only to process your payment and will not use it for marketing purposes. For reasons of security, credit card information is not stored on our servers. We will retain order information for our records, but this information is never shared with third parties.

 

 **6\. Changes to the Website and E-Mail Privacy Policy**

Please note that this Website and E-Mail Privacy Policy may change from time to time, and use of personal information that we gather is subject to the privacy notice in effect at the time of use. You should check the carnegiehall.org site periodically to see recent changes.
