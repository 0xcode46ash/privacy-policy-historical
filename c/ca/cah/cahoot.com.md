### Who do we disclose your information to?

  1. #### **Credit reference agencies**

In accordance with standard banking practice, if you apply for an account, we will provide certain information about you to a credit reference agency to carry out a credit assessment. If you open an account, we will provide regular details about your use of your account to the credit reference agency. Information held by credit reference agencies is available to other businesses to cross-check to prevent fraud and money laundering, trace debtors and assess credit applications. 

  2. #### **Business partners**

cahoot does not sell, rent or trade your personal information to others. However, cahoot may share your information with other companies in the Abbey National Group and its business partners include third parties who provide us with services to enable us to operate the cahoot website and the cahoot account. We will endeavour to provide your information only to business partners who agree to use such information in a manner which is consistent with this policy.




## joint Applications

Where you and another person wish to open a joint account, each one of you needs to submit your own application details to us so that we know each of you has agreed to your details being used in accordance with this policy. 

## **location**

From time to time, we may need to transfer your personal information outside the European Economic Area where this is necessary to operate your account or provide information to a cahoot business partner. 

## accessing and updating your information

You may request a copy of the information which we have about you at any time by writing to us at cahoot, Friars House, Warwick Road, Coventry, CV1 2TE. You may inform us at any time that your personal details have changed by filling out the appropriate pages on the change personal details section of the cahoot website.

## data protection statement 

In this statement, 'cahoot' means **cahoot** , a division of Abbey National plc. This statement relates to the information you give in the online application form and to any other information which you provide to cahoot or which it holds on you whether or not you become a customer.

**If your application is unsuccessful cahoot may pass your information to Loans.co.uk who may use this information to offer you alternative products and may make an additional search against a credit reference agency. By continuing with your application you are agreeing that we can pass all your information to Loans.co.uk.**

## credit assessment

**cahoot** may use your information for the purposes of determining whether you are eligible to open a cahoot account and, in particular, to carry out a credit assessment, which may include credit scoring, except for savings or savings and investment applications. **cahoot** may search the files of credit reference agencies which will keep a record of each search and make any other enquiries relating to you that it considers necessary (e.g. from another financial institution). Details about you and the conduct of your **cahoot account** will also be passed to credit reference agencies. An association between joint applicants or between yourself and any named partner/spouse will be created at the credit reference agency. This will link your financial records, each of which will be taken into account in all future applications by either or both of you. If an association already exists then your application will be assessed with reference to these associated records. This situation will continue until one of you successfully files a disassociation at the credit reference agency. 

Before opening your account, cahoot will check your details with fraud prevention agencies and may make searches at credit reference agencies who will supply cahoot with information, including information from the electoral register for the purpose of verifying your identity. Scoring methods may be used to verify your identity. The credit reference agencies will record details of the search whether or not the application proceeds but please note that this is not a credit check and will not be seen or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit. If you give false or inaccurate information and fraud is suspected, cahoot will record this. 

**cahoot** and other organisations may use and search these records to help make decisions about credit and credit related services and insurance including motor, household, credit, life and other insurance proposals and claims for you and members of your household; trace debtors, recover debt, prevent money laundering and fraud, manage accounts and for statistical purposes. 

For further information on the credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies that we use, please telephone 0845 602 0319. 

If your application is unsuccessful and you wish to discuss your application further, you can contact **cahoot** via [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20060615015016id_/http%3A//cahoot.com/contact_us/contact_us.html).

The information may also be disclosed to regulatory bodies and other organisations so they can check our compliance with regulatory requirements and voluntary codes of practice. **If your application is unsuccessful cahoot may pass your information to Loans.co.uk who may use this information to offer you alternative products.** cahoot may send your personal data to Abbey National Group companies, associated companies or business partners, including to countries outside the European Economic Area, on the understanding that they will keep the information confidential and secure.
