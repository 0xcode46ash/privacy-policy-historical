# security and privacy

We are committed to protecting the privacy of all personal information which we obtain from you when you visit the cahoot website and when you use your cahoot account. Our aim is to safeguard the security and privacy of your personal information whilst providing you with a personalised service that keeps you up-to-date with products and services which meet your preferences and needs. By using the cahoot website, you agree to the collection and use of such information in accordance with the following Privacy Policy and Data Protection Statement.

For information on what we're doing to keep your money safe and what you can do to help see our [online security page](https://web.archive.org/web/20111209041814id_/http%3A//www.cahoot.com/security/online_security.html).

## security

We employ appropriate technical security measures to protect your personal information and ensure that it is not accessed by unauthorised persons. Information storage is on secure computers in a locked information centre and information is encrypted wherever possible. Our security procedures also provide that we may request proof of identification before we will release personal information to you. We undergo periodic reviews of our security policies and procedures to ensure that cahoot systems are secure and protected.

What does 'This page contains both secure and non-secure items' message mean?

This message occurs when the page displays both the secure and non-secure items, such as pictures. You should select 'yes' to view the page. Your financial details with cahoot are completely secure and in no way compromised. 

## Strengthen your defences against online identity theft

Online fraudsters are using more sophisticated methods to commit online fraud. They use hard to detect techniques to steal your online identity, when you bank online. They do this without you even being aware that it has happened.

Anti-virus software and firewalls are very important to have installed on your computer, but they can't always protect you from these attacks, as fraudsters are developing more sophisticated ways of stealing your online identity.

Rapport needs to be used alongside your existing anti-virus and firewall protection to strengthen your defences online against identity theft and fraud.

Rapport has been developed by the financial security experts at [ Trusteer](http://www.trusteer.com/). It has been described as '...a major boost in fraud prevention...' by the [ Online Banking Report](http://www.trusteer.com/company/press/trusteer-receives-best-web-award-online-banking-report) and they also named Rapport as 'Best of the Web'.

## How Rapport Works

Rapport strengthens your online security by 'locking down' the connection between your computer, keyboard and cahoot internet banking. It helps stop your data going to counterfeit sites, so you can be safe in the knowledge that only you are transacting on your account.

Anti-virus software helps to stop threats, by scanning your PC and looking for suspicious files, whereas firewalls hide your computer from attackers, and helps stop criminals getting data in and out of your computer.

Rapport doesn't replace the benefits of anti-virus and firewall software or your unique image and phrase when accessing our internet banking - it works alongside them to provide increased protection when transacting online.
