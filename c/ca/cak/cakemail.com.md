**_Pancake Programming LLC and PancakeMail.com Privacy Policy_ :  
**

  1. _Information Collection_ :

Pancake Programming LLC, PO Box 472, Farmingdale, NY 11735 ("Pancake") is the sole owner of the information collected on Pancakemail.com (the "Site"). Pancake collects information from its users as detailed in this Privacy Policy. 

Registration - In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give the following information:

    1. a first and last name
    2. a username
    3. a password
    4. a password hint
    5. an offsite email address
    6. their city, state and country
  
Additionally, during registration or at any time thereafter, a user may provide any or all of the following information: 
    1. their opinions
    2. their preferences
    3. their sex, date of birth and mailing address
  

  2. _Information Use_ :

Pancake uses individual user information to provide e-mail storage, transmission and receiving services ("E-Mail Services"), and to facilitate the matching of users with appropriate content on and off the Site. Pancake maintains aggregate user information (that is, information about Pancake users as a group without tying information to specific users). This information includes population demographics, the relative popularity of Pancake’s various forums and services, service sign-up rates, and the like. Pancake uses this information to market the Site, to help sell advertising on the Site appropriate for the Pancake user population, to develop services and content for the Site, and to improve the performance of the Site. Pancake also maintains information tied to individual users for the purposes of providing E-Mail Services. Such information is used _only_ for the purposes of providing E-Mail Services. Pancake does not share this information with third parties. 

  

  3. _Log Files_

Pancake uses log files generated by software in response to user actions on the Site. The log file data include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP) identification, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and user "click" statistics. Pancake uses the data to maintain security over their servers and websites, analyze trends, administer the Site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. Pancake uses a log file analysis program called "Webalizer" that analyzes log file data to provide Pancake with general, non-user specific information about usage trends on the Site. Except when issues of security arise, Pancake does not tie log file data to individual users’ profile information. 

  

  4. _Communications from the Site_ :

_Special Offers and Updates_ \- Pancake sends all new members a welcoming e-mail to verify their account password and username. Established members may occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals and the like. Users may opt-out of these services, except the welcoming email, which is required. 

_Service Announcements_ \- Occasionally, Pancake may send out service related announcements, for example, when service is suspended for maintenance purposes or any other time the users' service may be affected. The user is not provided with the opportunity to opt out of receiving service related email announcements. 

_Customer Service_ \- Pancake communicates with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and to address issues relating to user accounts. These communications may be by postal mail, e-mail or phone, as appropriate. 

  

  5. _Sharing of Information_ :

Pancake does not share personal information with third parties except: 

    1. when required by law,
    2. when Pancake has a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process,
    3. when Pancake has a good faith belief that doing so is reasonably necessary to protect data or property owned, in the possession of or maintained by Pancake.
  
In the event Pancake goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or a sale of assets, ownership of users’ personal information may be transferred. Users will be notified prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. Pancake will notify users when, as a result of any business transition, users’ personally identifiable information will be used in a manner substantively inconsistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy (as may be amended from time to time). Pancake users may opt-out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to the Site. Users will be conspicuously presented with the option to opt-out at the point that the information is collected.

Pancake will notify users when their information is being collected by any third parties providing services in conjunction with Pancake. Pancake does this so users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require such third parties. 

  

  6. _Links_ :

The Site contains links to other sites. Pancake is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. Pancake encourages users to be aware when they leave the Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Pancake. 

  

  7. _Surveys_ :

From time-to-time, Pancake may request information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is voluntary, and users may elect not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). User information collected in surveys will be used as detailed in a notice provided to users prior to completing each survey. Users may elect not to participate in any survey. 

  

  8. _Security_ :

Pancake takes every reasonable precaution to protect its users’ information. User information submitted to Pancake via the Site (e.g., vie web-based forms) is NOT encrypted for transmission using SSL encryption. Pancake’s servers are maintained in a limited access facility accessible only by authorized Pancake personnel. 

  

  9. _Correcting and Deleting Personal Information_ :

Users may correct, modify or otherwise update their personal information at any time. Users may accomplish this via the _user settings_ section of the Site. Users may delete any optional user information at any time via the user settings section on the Site. 

  

  10. _Notification of Changes_ :

Pancake will provide notice to users in advance of any substantive change to this privacy policy. In the event that personally identifiable information is to be used in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, individuals will be notified by e-mail and given the opportunity to opt-out of such use. Such election to opt-out of the use may cause the user’s account to be cancelled.
