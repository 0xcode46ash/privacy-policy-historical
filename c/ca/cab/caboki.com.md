# Caboki.com Privacy Policy

WE'RE ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY!

**We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any third party. Period.**

## How we gather information from users

How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you request free sample, sign up for coupons or when you make a purchase. Like most Web sites, Caboki.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit.

## What we do with the information we collect

Like other web sites, we collect information to enhance your visit. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.

Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used to enhance user experience. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).

We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on Caboki.com to communicate with you about your purchase; our privacy policy; services and products offered by Caboki.com and other topics we think you might find of interest.

Personally Identifiable Information collected by Caboki.com may also be used for other purposes, including site administration, troubleshooting, processing of transactions and other communications with you. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.

## Children

Caboki.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Caboki.com has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the Customer Service Page.

## Changes to this Policy

Caboki.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information was collected.
