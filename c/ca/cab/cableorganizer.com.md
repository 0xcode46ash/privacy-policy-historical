# Cable Organizer .com - Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

At CableOrganizer.com, we do everything in our power to safeguard our customers' personal information, and believe that it's important for you to understand exactly how and why we collect, use and protect it. Please keep in mind that by visiting and/or purchasing from CableOrganizer.com, you automatically accept the policies outlined below.

**Information Sharing**  
Any information that we collect is used to contact you regarding your order, or otherwise improve the content of our web pages. All information that you submit is held strictly confidential; it’s our policy to **_never_** rent, sell, or otherwise share your personal information with other organizations for commercial purposes.

**Postal Addresses**  
If you supply us with your postal address online, it will only be used to ship your order, send you any information that you specifically request, or let you know about occasional special offers.

**Telephone Numbers   **  
When you provide CableOrganizer.com with your phone number, we promise that you will only receive phone calls regarding online orders that you have placed with us.

**Payment Information**  
We use the latest 256-bit encryption technology to protect your sensitive personal and financial information. Thanks to a combination of Digital ID and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, our customers can rest assured that no unauthorized entity will gain access to bank account information or credit card numbers.

**Newsletter Opt-In**  
We offer periodical e-newsletters and promotional e-mails, but in order to avoid spamming our customers, we only send mailings to individuals who have joined our opt-in list. If you have opted-in in the past but no longer wish to receive these e-mails, simply send a message to [newsletter@cableorganizer.com](mailto:newsletter@cableorganizer.com), and we’ll remove you from the list.

**Referring Domains**  
When people visit CableOrganizer.com via links from other websites, we keep track of which domains referred them to us in order to spend our advertising dollars more wisely, and thereby lower our costs to you. However, we don’t obtain any specific personal information like names or e-mail addresses. In order to improve our website, we track which CableOrganizer.com pages consumers visit, and also keep other voluntarily-given information, such as survey responses and site registrations, on record.

  
**Cookies**  
We use cookies to help our Log Analysis Programs accurately track browsing and purchasing sessions on CableOrganizer.com. These cookies contain no personal information. Each time a person visits our website, our web server automatically recognizes the consumer’s domain IP address, but does not acquire any other personal information. 

**Ad Servers**  
We do not partner or have special relationships with any ad serving companies; however, we do advertise on Google AdWords and Overture. Either or both of these companies may set a cookie on your computer when you click on one of these ads, but this only allows us to measure whether or not the ad is effective.

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**  
From time to time, we may decide to use customer information for new, unanticipated purposes that have not been previously disclosed in this Privacy Notice. If our information practices change at any time in the future, we will immediately post the changes on our website and give you the choice to opt out of these new functions. If you’re especially concerned about how your information is being used, we encourage you to check our website periodically to stay well informed of any possible updates.

**Product Review E-Mails**  
We love to know what our customers think of our products and service, so at some point, we may send you an e-mail asking you to review a recent purchase. If you'd prefer not to receive these e-mails, please let us know at [optoutreview@cableorganizer.com](mailto:optoutreview@cableorganizer.com), and we'll be sure to remove you from the list.

Thank you for your interest in our Privacy Policy! If you have additional questions that we haven't answered here, or feel that this website isn't following its stated information policy, please feel free to contact us via toll-free phone call, e-mail, or post.
