# This Is Cable - Cable Services And Providers

#### Privacy PolicyÂ 

**ThisIsCable.com Protects the Privacy of Your Personally Identifiable Information**

ThisIsCable understands the importance of safeguarding your personally identifiable information. We use the personally identifiable information you provide to us for a very narrow and specific purpose: to help you learn what broadband cable services are available in your neighborhood and which cable company provides them, and to help you sign up for the services you choose.

When you first ask ThisIsCable for information about broadband cable services in your area, we need to know your physical address. We use your address to determine which cable company or companies provide services to your neighborhood. Cable companies use ThisIsCable to give you specific information about cable service offers that are available at your address. Should you choose to place an order for broadband cable services, you will then need to supply ThisIsCable with additional personally identifiable information.

Our policy regarding this information is simple. ThisIsCable will not sell or rent any of the personally identifiable information you provide. In fact, the personally identifiable information you supply will not be disclosed to any third party EXCEPT to the cable company that offers in your neighborhood the services you are interested in. And, unless you decide otherwise, the cable company can only use your information as necessary to furnish to you the services you have selected through ThisIsCable.

We do collect aggregate statistical data, without names or specific street addresses, on the use of ThisIsCable. We do this in order to monitor customer traffic patterns and service use. This helps us administer the ThisIsCable service and improve its design and performance. We also keep a log of your query and response for approximately one month for troubleshooting purposes.
