Cabela's also uses cookies to observe our site visitors' navigation throughout the site. This helps us identify ways to improve the shopping experience. If you are trying to place items in your cart and your items are lost, your browser is probably not set up to accept cookies. If this happens, feel free to place your order over the phone, by fax or upgrade your browser.

_**Security**_

What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Cabela's control?

Cabela's values your business and is committed to doing everything possible to make our online ordering process 100% secure. As always, our 100% satisfaction guarantee applies to any and all purchases from Cabela's.

_**Secure Ordering Process**_  


Using technology provided by Clear Commerce e-business software, in addition to special security features built into popular browser software, the Cabela's site provides you with advanced online security.

Any credit card information you enter on our site is strongly encrypted by industry-standard protocol, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). Cabela's uses SSL to communicate with secure browsers like Netscape and Internet Explorer. These browsers encrypt your credit card and personal information in a way that makes it extremely difficult for anyone to decode. Don't worry if your browser is secure or not - if it is insecure, you will not be able to purchase on our online store.

Once you have completed your order online, our security procedures do not end. For example, the moment you press "submit" to send you order, the encrypted order is sent directly to our order processing system. Your order is automatically pushed through the system and never "sits" in an unsecured queue. Further, our order processing system is not connected to the Internet, so no one can gain access to your information. As an added precaution, we do not keep your credit card information on record once your order has been processed. Although this may be an inconvenience to you (you must re-type your credit card information each time you place an order), we feel that this step is the safest way to conduct online business and ensure your security.

Ways to tell when you are in a secure section:  In all browsers, look for the "http" in the URL to change to "https." The added "s" represents that you have entered a secure area. The entire ordering process on Cabela's online store, from when you decide to checkout until your order is confirmed, is conducted on a secure server. Further, many popular browsers have a symbol to indicate secure mode. Specifically:   
    
To ensure our customer security and site performance, our web servers are hosted off-site. 

If you are still unsure of giving your credit card over the Internet, please feel free to phone, fax, or mail your order to us. For telephone ordering or assistance, please call 1-800-237-4444. Our fax number for orders is 1-800-496-6329 (for US/Canada 1-308-254-2200). Or, send your order to :

**Cabela's, Inc.**  
Attn: Order Processing  
One Cabela Drive  
Sidney, NE 69160

If you have any further question regarding your online security, please contact us at 1-800-237-8888 or [**e-mail Customer Relations**](http://customerservice.cabelas.com/service.html).
