_**Privacy**_

_**What personally identifiable information is being collected?**_  


Cabelas.com collects the domain name of e-mail address (where possible) of visitors to our Web site, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via-email (to receive our newsletters), aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit and information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information, requests for information, and/or site registrations. Physical addresses, credit card numbers and expiration dates are needed for orders placed on the site.

_**How is the information being used and with whom may the information be shared?**_  


The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web site, used to notify consumers about updates to our Web site or problems with their request, and not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.

_**What organization is collecting the information?**_  


Personal information, excluding credit card numbers, that you offer to Cabela's using the On-line Store, is collected by Cabela's and used for future customer updates that are specifically aimed at your preferences. In order to keep you informed of other outdoor products and manufacturers, we occasionally make our customer postal address list available to other reputable companies. You can, however, have your name put on our do-not-share list by clicking the box on all applicable forms or by sending email to us or writing to us at the above postal address. Please provide us with your exact name and postal address. We will be sure your name is removed from the list we share with other organizations. Entering sweepstakes may require subscribing to the company newsletter. Information from sweepstakes entries will be used to contact you if you win.

_**What are cookies and how do we use them?**_  


Our first priority is our customers' security; therefore, we have implemented the use of cookies. Cabela's uses cookies in the online store to keep track of your shopping basket items.

A cookie is a block of text placed in a file on your computer's hard drive by a Website you've visited. Cookies cannot identify an individual user specifically, such as by name or address, unless the cookie data is attached to personally identifiable information such as online registration forms.

A cookie from Cabela's is simply an ID number to allow you to retrieve your shopping cart and the items you have placed in it. Cabela's does not use the cookies to analyze customers, only to keep track of orders. If you are trying to place items in your cart and your items are lost, your browser is probably not set up to accept cookies. If this happens, feel free to place your order over the phone, by fax, or simply upgrade your browser. To find information on how to enable cookies for your browser, [**click here**](http://www.cabelas.com/texis/scripts/store/+nwwFqcgwx-EPPWKK8qFqcgwx-EPPWKK8dzmwwwq/process.html?formname=displayCookieText).

_**What choices are available to you regarding the collection, use and distribution of the information and how you can correct any inaccuracies in information?**_  


If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by sending an e-mail to us or by writing to us at the above postal address and telling us that you do not want to receive e-mail from our company. Note: We do not make the e-mail addresses of those who access our site available to any other organizations or companies.

If you provide us with your postal address, you may receive periodic catalogs from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by sending an e-mail to us or writing to us at the above postal address. Please provide us with your exact name and postal address. We will be sure your name will be removed from the mailings of this information. For more detailed information regarding this, [**click here**](http://www.cabelas.com/cgi-bin/texis.Jan10/scripts/vnews/custserv/newspaper/+/ART/1999/08/12/37de657b2).

If you provide us with your telephone number or facsimile (FAX) number, you may receive telephone or FAX contact from us with information regarding your orders or requests for information. Please provide us with your correct phone numbers or FAX numbers so we can contact you when we have a problem with your order.

If our privacy practices change in the future the information will be posted on our site.

_**Security**_

What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Cabela's control?

Cabela's values your business and is committed to doing everything possible to make our online ordering process 100% secure. As always, our 100% satisfaction guarantee applies to any and all purchases from Cabela's.

_**Secure Ordering Process**_  


Using technology provided by Clear Commerce e-business software, in addition to special security features built into popular browser software, the Cabela's site provides you with advanced online security.

Any credit card information you enter on our site is strongly encrypted by industry-standard protocol, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). Cabela's uses SSL to communicate with secure browsers like Netscape and Internet Explorer. These browsers encrypt your credit card and personal information in a way that makes it extremely difficult for anyone to decode. Don't worry if your browser is secure or not - if it is insecure, you will not be able to purchase on our online store.

Once you have completed your order online, our security procedures do not end. For example, the moment you press "submit" to send you order, the encrypted order is sent directly to our order processing system. Your order is automatically pushed through the system and never "sits" in an unsecured queue. Further, our order processing system is not connected to the Internet, so no one can gain access to your information. As an added precaution, we do not keep your credit card information on record once your order has been processed. Although this may be an inconvenience to you (you must re-type your credit card information each time you place an order), we feel that this step is the safest way to conduct online business and ensure your security.

Ways to tell when you are in a secure section:  In all browsers, look for the "http" in the URL to change to "https." The added "s" represents that you have entered a secure area. The entire ordering process on Cabela's online store, from when you decide to checkout until your order is confirmed, is conducted on a secure server. Further, many popular browsers have a symbol to indicate secure mode. Specifically:   
 

If you are still unsure of giving your credit card over the Internet, please feel free to phone, fax, or mail your order to us. For telephone ordering or assistance, please call 1-800-237-4444. Our fax number for orders is 1-800-496-6329 (for US/Canada 1-308-254-2200). Or, send your order to :

**Cabela's, Inc.**  
Attn: Order Processing  
One Cabela Drive  
Sidney, NE 69160

If you have any further question regarding your online security, please contact us at 1-800-237-8888 or e-mail Customer Relations.
