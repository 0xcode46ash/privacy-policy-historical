Logging and cookies

During the period you are logged in our site, we log IP addresses (a number assigned to your computer when you use the Internet), browser and platform types, domain names, access times, referral data (the last site or URL you visited before logging into our site and the first site or URL you visit after leaving our site), and your activity while using or reviewing our site.

As part of our services, we also use cookies. A cookie is a message sent to your browser from a Web server that is stored on your computer's hard drive. The message is sent back to the Web server whenever the browser requests a page from that server. Many commercial Internet sites use cookies. While a code in the cookie file enables the site to label you as a particular user, it does not identify you by name or address unless you have provided the site with such information or set up preferences in your browser to do so automatically. You may opt out of accepting cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, rejecting cookies may prevent you from using certain functions and you may have to repeatedly enter information to take advantage of services or promotions. In general, cookies allow us to identify you as a particular user and thus provide you with a more customized service. We may also use cookies to track customer or user requests, inquiries and traffic patterns or to determine audience size and repeated usage.

Who should use our Web site?

Our Web site is for financial products and services and is not intended for children. We offer financial products and services and thus do not market any products or services to children under the age of thirteen or knowingly collect any information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that information is or has been submitted by or collected from a child under the age of thirteen, we will delete this information.

Who collects this information?

In order to better serve your particular needs, the information noted above is collected by CME and other companies working on CME's behalf. In addition to collecting information from you, you should also know that, depending on the nature of your transaction, we may collect information from outside sources.

How is this information used?

The information you submit to us via our on-line forms and e-mail is used to provide you with the response or service you have requested. It may also be used with the information we collect via logging and cookies to identify you as a particular user; to track and measure Web site usage and customer/user preferences, interests, demographics, and traffic patterns; and to determine audience size and repeated usage. This information may also be used to manage and customize our Web site's content, layout, and services in order to improve our site, enhance customer service, and provide tailored messages.

We may also use this information to contact you about our products and services. If you do not wish to receive these communications, you can write us, e-mail us through cmegroup.com or simply reply to any e-mails you receive from our site informing us of your desire to be removed from our mailing lists.

European customers:

CME has legal obligations, under the Data Protection Act 1998, to collect any data that you provide to us fairly. Each time you provide us with personal data, CME will let you know how we intend to use it and whether we will pass the information on to a third party. CME will hold your personal information securely and will only maintain a record of your information in circumstances where you have provided us with your consent.

As part of our normal operations and in order to better serve your particular needs, CME may utilize your personal data over and above the purpose of performing under the Customer Connection Agreement or complying with its statutory requirements. An 'opt-out' option will appear each time.
