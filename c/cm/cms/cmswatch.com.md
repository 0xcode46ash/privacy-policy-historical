Technology Report Excerpt

[_The CMS Report_ looks at... Vignette Portal's system requirements](http://www.cmswatch.com/CMS/Report)

"Compared to other portals, Vignette Portal has broad support for operating systems, databases, Web servers, and application servers. While it is based on J2EE, in theory it will work with everything that the application server supports. Note, however, that not all platforms are certified by Vignetteâ€™s support arm, and the company may not have much experience with your particular configuration."
