Technology Report Excerpt

[_The Enterprise Search Report_ looks at... Storage Considerations](http://www.cmswatch.com/Search/Report)

"Nevertheless, storage is a key consideration. The number of documents and the average size of the documents increase each year. Electronic mail can pose special challenges because a mail message can include an attachment that may be several megabytes in size. An example is a short message containing a PowerPoint deck or an Adobe Portable Document Format of a 16 page four-color brochure. A good rule of thumb is to plan to increase storage capacity for a search system by 50 percent each year. The search architecture should accommodate plug-and-play storage devices. Mirroring, RAID technology, and clusters are storage approaches that a search system requires. Loss of an index means that a new index must be built from ground zero if a current back up or fail-over mirror is not available."
