cMarket Privacy Policy

The privacy of your personal information is very important to us. As such, cMarket, Inc. ("cMarket") presents this statement to give our users a clear understanding of how we operate our Web site and how we handle your personal information. If you have any questions or concerns relating to privacy or security, please send an email to [webmaster@cmarket.com](mailto:webmaster@cmarket.com). cMarket may modify this statement at any time, and, if we do, we will notify our users that we have done so.

**What Information We Collect**

When you visit and navigate our Web site, we will not collect personal information about you unless you provide us that information voluntarily. By "personal information," we mean data that is unique to an individual, such as a name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or credit card related information.

When you register for any service or feature on our site, we require the following personal information: e-mail address and first and last name. We may also ask you to select a personal user name and password. In addition, we request that you provide additional information, such as gender, telephone number, street address, city, state, zip code and country. If you register for any service under which cMarket will process payments made by you, then we may require certain financial information (such as the name on the credit card, credit card number and expiration date).

cMarket does not collect information posted in any discussion or chat areas on our site.

**How We Use Information**

Because we consider any personal information you give us as confidential, except in the limited circumstances described below, as a general rule cMarket uses information collected from you in aggregate form only. In other words, we combine the information with data collected from other individuals to produce anonymous, aggregated statistical information. We collect and use demographic information in order to improve the products and services we offer, to conduct market research, to generate profiles and reports, and to improve the overall experience of our site. We also may share this anonymous, aggregated information -- which does not identify individuals -- with partners, advertisers or other third parties.

Except as described below, cMarket will not disclose to third parties any identifying personal information gathered from you unless (1) we tell you how your information will be used and you give cMarket specific permission to share this information or (2) cMarket is required to disclose such information by any applicable law or legal process (like a subpoena or court order).

The exception to this general rule concerns our role as a facilitator of online fundraising events. In order to fulfill this role effectively, cMarket must be able to provide personal information of users to the organization holding the event. Specifically, cMarket discloses the following information: (1) name, email and mailing address (and/or other contact information) of all donors, (2) name and email of all "interested parties" - e.g., individuals who access the cMarket site via refer your friends, email-this-page and/or "guestbook" functionalities, as well as individuals who place watches on items, and (3) name, email, mailing address (and/or other contact information) and credit card number or all high bidders and second-highest bidders (in case the high bidder is ineligible).

**Security**

cMarket utilizes generally-accepted security measures (such as encryption) to protect against the misuse or unauthorized disclosure of any personal information you submit to us. However, like other Internet sites, we cannot guarantee that it is completely secure from people who might attempt to evade security measures or intercept transmissions over the Internet.

**Updating Information and Opting-Out**

We provide you with the ability to correct or update any information you have provided us. Simply click on the "Preferences" tab located at the top of each cMarket catalog page.

If you no longer wish to receive communications from cMarket, you may email us at [webmaster@cmarket.com](mailto:webmaster@cmarket.com) or click on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email sent to you by cMarket.

You should know that opting-out or unsubscribing from our site does not delete the personal information from our system that may exist in backup or disaster-recovery files.

**Cookies**

Cookies are pieces of data stored on your computer's hard drive by a Web site. Cookies are an industry standard and used by most major Web sites to improve their services.

cMarket uses cookies for user convenience. The cookie will tell our system certain information so you don't have to fill in the same information each time you visit us. However, cMarket does not store this information. Our site can only read the cookies placed on your computer by us. We cannot access any information on your hard drive placed there by you or any other source.

Cookies also may be used by cMarket on an aggregate basis to track site navigation. This information is not traceable to an individual user.

The cookie feature can be turned off on your browser. For more information on turning off the cookie feature, consult your browser "Help" section. If you choose to turn off cookies, you can still access all areas of our site. However, you might have to "refuse" a cookie each time you encounter one searching our site.

**IP Addresses**

An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you access the Internet. This number may be the same each time you access the Internet or it may change. Like other Internet sites, cMarket uses IP addresses to collect aggregate information about numbers of visitors and site usage. The address is logged on our server when your computer requests information from cMarket. However, to allow users to access our site anonymously, your IP address is not linked with personal information about you. However, cMarket reserves the right, in rare instances, to use IP addresses to identify individuals who threaten our site, service or users.

**Chats And Discussion Boards**

Please be aware that chat areas and discussion boards are open to the public so others using these areas on our site can read your posts. Any information you include when participating in chats or in posts to discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access. For example, if you include your e-mail address in a message you post on a discussion board, it is publicly accessible.

Chats and discussion boards are monitored. cMarket reserves the right to remove any posts we feel are inappropriate, contain abusive language or threaten or violate the privacy of our company, sponsors or visitors.

**Surveys and Polls**

If you respond to any surveys or polls on our site, we may ask you for demographic information such as your gender or age. This information is collected only as anonymous, aggregated information and is used for statistical purposes. Otherwise, we do not collect or store your personal responses.

**Children**

We ask that only individuals who are over the age of 18 register on our site. If we learn that we inadvertently have collected identifying personal information from an individual under the age of 18, we will promptly delete that information from our system.

**Other Web Sites**

This privacy statement applies only as long as you remain on the cMarket Web site. Once you leave cMarket to visit another site, we have no control over your privacy or security issues even if you reached the other site by clicking on a link within cMarket.
