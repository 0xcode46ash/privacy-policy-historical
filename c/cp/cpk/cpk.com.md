# California Pizza Kitchen - Privacy Policy

a. Personally Identifiable Information.

In general, you can visit CPK.com without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. If you choose to register or become a member of our loyalty program and are 13 years of age or older, we will collect your name, date of birth, email address, and street address along with other information you may choose to submit, and you will choose a password as part of the registration process ("Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII"). If you make a purchase on our Site we will also ask you for additional information including the credit card number and expiration date, billing address, shipping address, name on the account and telephone numbers for the billing and shipping addresses ("Credit Card Information").

For your security we do not keep or store your Credit Card Information after your purchase transaction is completed unless you elect to create a profile containing your Credit Card Information or utilize our Google wallet function. We only use your Credit Card Information as necessary to complete your purchase transactions.

We may combine information that we may collect from you from different means online as well as offline (or through mobile applications) into one customer database, and use that information in order to communicate with you and determine special offers to send to you.

b. Social Networking Information

Our Site may provide the opportunity for you to post information about you and/or your experiences with us. Remember, by posting any information, it will become publicly available, so please use discretion regarding posting your own personal information. We may ask you to share information about you stored on social networks and other third-party services in order to personalize your experience on the Site. This information may include PII such as your username or id and email address, as well as interests, activities, and relationships to other users of the Site or of social media.

c. Contact information for email newsletters, emails and/or mobile offers

From time to time we send newsletters, emails and/or other communications to share information or special offers about the Site, our restaurants or loyalty program. If you have registered with our Site, loyalty program, a mobile application or another of our promotions you are likely to receive such communications. If you provide us with your mobile number or obtain a mobile application we may send communications to your phone or via the mobile application.

Remember, if you elect to receive texts from us, your wireless carrier may impose a charge on incoming texts. Please check with your wireless carrier for details.

You may opt out of receiving communications from us by following the instructions provided on the Site or by following the instructions or links contained in the communication.

d. Entry information for Contests or Sweepstakes

We may operate contests, sweepstakes or other promotions through our Site or social media outlets which may require registration in order to enter. The PII that may be collected in an entry or similar form includes, but may not be limited to, your first name, last name, zip code, phone number, age and email address. Your entry in the contest or sweepstakes may also result in your being added to our mailing/texting lists.

Winners of contests, sweepstakes, and/or promotions will often be required to provide additional PII in order to authenticate themselves or to fulfill the prize. Entry into a contest or sweepstakes or acceptance of a prize may also require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Your PII may be used by us to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other promotional purposes.

If the privacy policy varies for a particular sweepstakes, promotion or feature, that information will be disclosed in the sweepstakes or promotion rules or feature’s terms of use. We urge you to review the official rules and privacy policy (if different) of the particular contest/sweepstakes before participating. In the event that the Official Rules of a contest/sweepstakes conflict with this Privacy Policy, the Official Rules will govern.

e. Information collected for Surveys or Voting

From time-to-time we may request PII from you via surveys or voting polls. Most surveys will be anonymous and not request your PII. However, at times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey. All survey participation is, of course, voluntary, and you will be able to decide the information you provide.

f. Information collected for “Send to a Friend” messages.

The Site may allow you to send information on the site via email, social network, or other messaging system to recipients who you feel may be interested in receiving such information. To use this feature you provide us with certain information about the receiving party. Any PII you provide in connection with sending such other party the message, such as your name and your email address will, of course, be disclosed to such other party. While, due to technical restrictions, the recipient's information may be retained in our systems as required for delivery and logging, we do not knowingly share it with third parties and we do not use this PII for any purpose except to send this one-time message (unless the recipient has already consented to such use of his/her PII). Recipients of these messages will not be opted in to any future communications from us unless they have previously given their consent to us through other means. 

We may use aggregated data (independent of any personal identifiers) for our own research and commercial purposes. This information includes what areas/features our users visit most frequently. We use this information to improve the Site.

We use your PII in order to send communications and information to you regarding the Site, our restaurants and special offers. We also send you information about third-party products and services that we think you may find of interest, but we do not provide your PII to third parties for marketing purposes.

We reveal Personally Identifiable Information about you to unaffiliated third parties if: (1) you request or authorize it; (2) the information is provided to help complete a transaction for you; (3) the information is provided as we may in our sole discretion determine is necessary or reasonably required to comply with the law, applicable regulations, court orders or subpoenas, to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements, or to protect our rights, property or safety or the rights, property or safety of our users or others (e.g., to a consumer reporting agency for fraud protection etc.); (4) the disclosure is done as part of an actual or contemplated purchase, transfer or sale of services or assets (e.g., in the event that substantially all of our assets are acquired by another party, customer information may be one of the transferred assets); (5) the information is provided to our agents, outside vendors or service providers to perform functions on our behalf (e.g., analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing customer service, processing orders, etc.); or (6) to others as described in this Privacy Policy.
