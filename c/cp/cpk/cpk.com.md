**Our Privacy Commitment To Registered Users**

California Pizza Kitchen, Inc. ("CPK") is committed to treating the personal and corporate information of our users with respect and sensitivity. Our privacy commitment is described in this Privacy Policy. As our services evolve and we perceive the need or desirability of using information collected in other ways, we may from time to time amend this Privacy Policy. Please check back here periodically or contact us at the address listed at the end of this Policy.

This Policy is part of our Terms of Use Agreement. Please click [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20021201231720id_/http%3A//www.cpk.com/terms/index.cfm) to see that Agreement.

**General Information**

1\. We believe that you have the right to understand how your information is stored and used. We require that sites linked to our Site contain a notice identifying their privacy policies.

2\. You may have provided us with certain registration information, including personal identifying information ("PII"). We do not disclose PII to third parties except where we have so informed you or as required by law. Our employees and contractors may have access to personal identifying information maintained on our system, but all are required to keep it confidential and to use it only as necessary to perform their responsibilities. From time to time, we may allow access to "co-branded" pages on our Site - pages that are presented to you jointly by CPK and another entity. We will try always to indicate clearly, through prominent placement of that entity's name or logo or otherwise, whether a page is co-branded. If you provide your information on a co-branded page, your information may be provided to our co-branded partner, as well. In that event, the use and disclosure of that information will be governed by that partner's privacy policy. We require that all of our co-branding partners maintain their own privacy policies on their sites.

3\. You have the right, upon reasonable notice, to view your registration information and make any corrections that are necessary. You also have the right, subject to otherwise applicable law to request that your registration information be removed from our system upon termination of your registration.

4\. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the Site. No information, including information for registration in our CPKids program, should be submitted to or posted at CPK by users under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.

Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, we do not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever from our users under 13 years of age. All registrants receive an e-mail confirming their registration. In addition, when a user under 13 registers, he/she is required to provide the e-mail address of his/her parent or guardian and that parent or guardian receives an e-mail alerting them to that registration. In order for the potential user to receive any information from us, the parent or guardian must validate the registration, as described in the e-mail. No information collected from users under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside CPK except as explicitly stated during registration for each user's participation in the CPKids program.

Although users under 13 years of age may be allowed to participate in some contests and promotions, if such a user wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parent or guardian identified in the initial registration process. Publication of names, ages, or images for contest winners under 13 require parental or guardian consent.

We currently give all users, including children, the option to send "electronic postcards" to their friends. We ask each user to submit their friends' email addresses, their own email address, and their first name. We only use this information to send the postcard and do not include the sender's email address in the postcard. Both the friends' email addresses and the sender's email address are deleted from our system within 10 minutes.

Teens between the ages of 13 and 17 are required to provide the e-mail address of a parent or guardian and a notification message is sent to the parent or guardian of all users who are 13 to 17 years of age, which identifies the information supplied upon registration and allows the parent or guardian to be aware of and participate in the user's online experience.

5\. We use cookies to personalize our Site for you and to collect aggregate information about site usage by all of our users. A cookie is a text file that our Site transfers to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes and to enhance the quality of your visit to our Site. The cookie assigns a random, unique number to your computer. It does not contain information which would personally identify you, although we can associate the cookie with any personal identifying information that you provide us while visiting our Site. Our cookie records "clickstream" information (data reporting the URLs or names of the pages on our Site that you have visited). We do not allow anyone else to access your cookie. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, but doing so will limit system performance and may even cause certain features of the Site to malfunction or not to work at all.

6\. We sometimes use aggregated data (independent of any personal identifiers) for research and commercial purposes. This information includes what areas our users visit most frequently and what services they access most often. This information helps us develop a better site that is more useful and accessible to you.

7\. We may use your PII internally, among other things, to offer our own or third-party products and services that we think you may find of interest, but only CPK, its subsidiaries and contractors involved in distributing the offers or providing the products or services will have access to your PII. Our subsidiaries and contractors will be required to use any PII we provide them only for that intended purpose.

**Opt-Out, Access, and Security**

1\. If you do not wish to receive offers or other notices from us, you can "opt out" by contacting us at the address indicated at the end of this policy. In addition, if you provide us with PII, you will always have the option of requesting that the PII be removed from our system by contacting us at the address indicated at the end of this policy. You have the further right, upon reasonable notice, to view your registration information and make any corrections that are necessary.

2\. We use industry-standard, established security measures in place in our physical facilities and in our computer systems, databases, and communications networks that are designed reasonably to protect information contained within our systems from loss, misuse or alteration.

**Corporate Information**

1\. We also protect your corporate information from use in ways that are intended to annoy or harass. We will not disclose any information that you provide us regarding your company as part of your registration except with your express consent or where necessary to provide you with a requested service. Our Terms of Use Agreement does not permit users of our Site to copy or use your corporate information to send you unsolicited communications or in other similarly improper ways.

2\. However, we are not responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any non-public information that you provide us. If there is information that you wish to protect from disclosure to others, do not provide it to us.

**Contacting Us**

If you have any questions or suggestions with respect to this policy, or if you wish to ask us to delete, correct, or show you your information as provided above, please go to [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20021201231720id_/http%3A//www.cpk.com/contact/index.cfm).
