# California Pizza Kitchen | Privacy Policy

California Pizza Kitchen, Inc. ("CPK") is committed to treating the personal and corporate information of our users with respect and sensitivity. Our privacy commitment is described in this Privacy Policy. As our services evolve and we perceive the need or desirability of using information collected in other ways, we may from time to time amend this Privacy Policy. We post the effective date of our Privacy Policy on our website ("Site"). We encourage you to check our Site frequently to see the current Privacy Policy and Terms of Use in effect and any changes that may have been made to them. If we make material changes to this Policy we will post the revised Policy and the revised effective date on this Site. Please check back here periodically or contact us at the address listed at the end of this Policy. 

This Policy is part of our Terms of Use Agreement. Please [click here](https://web.archive.org/copyright_legal/) to see that Agreement. 

1\. We believe that you have the right to understand how your information is stored and used. We require that sites linked to our Site contain a notice identifying their privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third parties or the content of linked sites, although we do encourage you to read the applicable privacy policies and terms and conditions of such parties or web sites. 

1\. In general, you can visit CPK.com without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. If you choose to register, and are 16 years of age or older, we will collect your name, date of birth, email address, and street address along with other information you may choose to submit, and you will choose a password as part of the registration process ("Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII"). If you make a purchase on our Site we will also ask you for additional information including the credit card number and expiration date, billing address, shipping address, name on the account and telephone numbers for the billing and shipping addresses ("Credit Card Information"). 

2\. For your security we do not keep or store your Credit Card Information after your purchase transaction is completed. We only share your Credit Card Information as necessary to complete your purchase transaction as disclosed in this Privacy Policy. 

3\. By providing your PII to us, you explicitly agree to our collection and use of such information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

We recognize that some of the users of our site may be under the age of 16 ("Minors"). We are committed to protecting Minors' privacy online and meeting the requirements of the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the Site. Minors may participate in the games on our Site anonymously and do not need to register in order to participate. In order for a Minor to participate in the CPK Birthday Club or to become a member of Friends of CPK it is necessary for the Minor to register and to provide certain limited personal information. This includes the Minor's name, address, email address and birth date. This information is used by CPK to mail Birthday Certificates to the Minor and to email promotional material to the Minor. 

BECAUSE WE MAY COLLECT MINOR'S PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SITE, WE REQUIRE THAT EACH MINOR'S PARENT PROVIDE CONSENT (AS EXPLAINED BELOW) BEFORE THE MINOR IS PERMITTED TO REGISTER ON OUR SITE. 

Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, we do not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever from our users under 16 years of age. 

When a Minor registers on our Site, we collect only the Minor's name, birth date and the email address and name of the Minor's parent or guardian. Our system immediately identifies those users whose birth date indicates that they are under the age of 16. We send the identified parent or guardian an e-mail alerting them to that registration and identifying the information supplied by the Minor. The email to the parent also contains a link to this Privacy Policy. In order for the registration to become complete and for the potential user to receive any information from us, the parent or guardian must validate the registration, as described in the e-mail, and consent to the Minor's registration. When the parent or guardian consents to the registration, we ask the parent or guardian to provide us with the mailing address for the Minor so that we may send the Minor the CPK Birthday certificate. The parent or guardian may refuse to allow the Minor to register. If the parent does not respond to the email within 72 hours or if the parent responds refusing to allow the registration then the information submitted by the Minor is automatically deleted from our system. 

In addition to the registration information provided by the Minor and the address information provided by the parent or guardian, we use cookies, as described below, which can be associated with the user's PII. No information collected from users under 16 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside CPK except as explicitly stated during registration for each user's participation in the CPKids program or in this Privacy Policy. 

Although users under 16 years of age may be allowed to participate in some contests and promotions, if such a user wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parent or guardian identified in the initial registration process. We do not publish names, ages, or images for contest winners under 16 without first receiving parental or guardian consent. 

A parent or guardian of a Minor may at any time review the child's personal information, request that we change the information, request that we collect no further information, or delete the child's registration by contacting us [via email](mailto:comments@cpk.com) or by clicking on the link on the registration page or by writing us at the address below. Parents can also telephone us at 310-342-5000 to request a change or to delete the child's registration information. Before any information is disclosed the parent will be required to provide the parent's name and email address for verification. We will only send the information to the parent email address in the registration file. 

If a Minor who is not registered on our Site contacts CPK through an email, we will respond to that email on a one-time basis without obtaining parental consent and we will then delete the email address. We will not use that email address to contact the Minor thereafter. Our Site does not provide email services, chat rooms or message boards. 

A limited number of people at CPK collect or maintain the PII of Minors.
