# Cpa Builder

Effective Date: January 15, 2007

This privacy policy discloses the practices for CpaBuilder.com (“CPAB” “us” or “we”) relating to consumer privacy. CPAB provides permission-based marketing services for its clients using information provided by third parties. Your privacy is very important to us and our intent in adopting this privacy policy is to balance your expectations of privacy and our legitimate business interests. This Privacy Policy may be revised or updated at any time. For your information, this page was last updated as of the date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

Information Collection and Use   
It is not necessary to register or provide any information at all to view this site. CPAB does not collect any personally identifiable information directly from consumers, but instead collects information consumers have provided to third parties and provided permission for this data to be shared with entities such as CPAB. CPAB, however, does not knowingly accept personal information from children under the age of 13.

CPAB uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. This enables us to track a user’s click and subsequent action or transaction on an advertiser’s Web site and to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. We may use newer technologies for this purpose as they as introduced. 

CPAB may enhance and/or merge personal information about consumers in our database with commercially-available third party data collected from other sources in an effort to ensure that the messages being sent to the consumer in online and/or offline marketing programs are relevant to their interests.

Choice   
You may opt-out of future emails from CPAB by using the mechanism specified in the email you received or by Clicking Here. Please note that under the CAN-SPAM Act, an advertiser is required to provide an opt-out mechanism for consumers to unsubscribe from future emails about the advertiser. Although not required to by law, many email marketers also include an opt-out mechanism to enable consumers to be removed from their mailing list. This has caused some confusion for consumers in opting out. The table below clarifies which opt-out mechanism you should use.

Use and Sharing of Information   
CPAB may share its data with advertisers, third party marketers, our affiliated entities for their online and/or offline marketing programs or in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial asset, reorganization or liquidation of any of our companies. We may release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply with the law or protect the rights, property, or safety of CPAB or others. 

Security   
CPAB employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of all data. Any data that is stored on CPAB’s servers is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. CPAB routinely evaluates its data security practices to identify security threats or opportunities for improvement. No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of CPAB to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. 

Changes   
CPAB may find it necessary or be legally obligated to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page and update the effective date so that you are always aware of our practices.
