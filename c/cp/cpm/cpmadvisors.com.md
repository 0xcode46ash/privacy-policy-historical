# CPMa - CPM Advisors - Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

The following describes the overall company practices of CPM Advisors, Inc. including all subsidiaries, affiliates and network (referred to as "CPM Advisors", "we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy was created to let you know what information we collect when you visit our web sites and when we serve advertisements on our network of websites, why we collect it and how it is used. 

#### What Information Is Collected?

#### Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data

CPM Advisors may collect anonymous data while you are visiting a CPM Advisors Web site or the Web site of one of CPM Advisors' business customers, including advertisers and Web publishers (collectively "Business Customers"). This anonymous data includes information such as a web visitor's IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a web visitor, date and time, domain type, and responses by a web visitor to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor. We, and/or a third party advertising technology vendor, may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and pixels. In addition, as a part of the registration process, users may provide us with additional non-personally identifiable information. Examples of the non-personally identifiable data that may be provided with the users consent would include age, gender, and interests. None of the foregoing information (collectively referred to as "non-personally identifiable data"), by itself, or together, can by its nature be tracked to a specific individual's personally identifiable information. Web visitors may elect not to allow us to use anonymous data by following the Opt-Out procedures set forth below. 

#### Personally Identifiable Consumer Data (PII)

To date, on our wholly owned properties we do not ask for personally identifiable information other than outlined below for business purposes. At some of CPM Advisors' partner properties, people may be asked to register and provide personally identifiable data. CPM Advisors is committed to making sure that our partners provide notice and choice to all consumers. 

#### Other Information that is Collected

At some CPM Advisors properties, including this one, CPM Advisors collects personal information on individuals and companies who want to enter into business relationships with CPM Advisors ("business information"). An example of this would include web publishers who want to become a part of CPM Advisors' web advertising network. We maintain business information for purposes of administering the program, such as maintaining account information and sending payments. We may share business information with third parties who provide administrative services (and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information), as well as pursuant to a court order or to law enforcement or government officials as we deem necessary or appropriate. 

#### How Is Such Information Used?

CPM Advisors will use your non-personal information in order to better target advertisements and offers across the CPM Advisors Network, to provide aggregate reporting to advertisers and clients, and to improve our advertising systems and products. In addition, that data may be combined with information collected from other sources so that we may better serve consumer preferences with offers that may be of interest to them. We may also share non-personally identifiable information with our subsidiaries and third party partners for similar use. 

If a consumer elects to provide CPM Advisors with personally identifiable data, we may utilize such data for marketing purposes. In addition, that data may be combined with information collected from other sources to better serve consumers with offers that may be of interest to them. For example, you may register for a newsletter and provide us with your email, If a consumer elects to provide us with personally identifiable data, he or she has the right to tell us not to make some of the uses of such data described herein or may have such data deleted in its entirety at any time. Please note that we will need you to provide your email address or other previously provided personal identifier in order to identify you in the Data Opt Out process. Also, please remember that if you choose to delete your information completely you will no longer receive the service in question. 

We collect PII from customers who are individuals or companies that wish to enter into business relationships with CPM Advisors, including websites and online marketers. This customer information is used only for purposes of administering these relationships, including maintaining account information, managing payments and communicating with the client. CPM Advisors may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on CPM Advisors; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of CPM Advisors; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of CPM Advisors, its websites or the public; 4) To provide updates and services that may be of interest to the customer. 

#### Security

CPM Advisors uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to CPM Advisors and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, CPM Advisors makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
