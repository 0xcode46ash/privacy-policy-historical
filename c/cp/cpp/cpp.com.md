**COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET**  
  
Our web site may log a user's IP address, browser type and version, dial-up domain, and computer operating system when he/she visits the site. IP addresses may in some cases be linked to personally identifiable information. We use the tracked information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. IP addresses of our web site users are used to diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site. IP addresses may also be used to gather broad demographic information-information that is not associated with any individual, and is anonymous.

Our web site uses an order form for customers to purchase products and services. We collect customers' contact information (such as their name, address and email address) and financial information (such as their account or credit card numbers). We verify our customer-provided credit card information with a third party prior to order processing. 

Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to our customers. We also provide mailings and other marketing collateral regarding product information and releases. We also conduct surveys during which non-personally identifiable information is collected but will not be used other than to garner survey results.  Users may opt out of receiving any of the surveys by contacting CPP by email, mail or phone as noted above or by selecting the appropriate option during account setup or modification once they are logged into their account.  We reserve the right to aggregate or compile and use data obtained from the scoring or other processing of products listed on this site or other wise sold or licensed by CPP, and to utilize this data for research, product development, and statistical analysis. Be assured that such data is only used in aggregate and never discloses any individual's identity.

If a user chooses to sign up to receive a CPP newsletter, that user will be able to unsubscribe from that newsletter by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in the newsletter, by e-mailing CPP Customer Relations custserv@cpp.com or by mailing CPP’s Customer Relations at the address provided below.

CPP collects the name and e-mail address of the end-user (the assessment taker) for the sole purpose of providing CPP’s customers with assessment results.  CPP does not share this information with any third parties (other than the test administrator). 

Certain federal, state, local or other government regulations may require that we disclose personally identifiable information about you. In such cases, we will use reasonable efforts to disclose only the information required under applicable law, such as in response to a court order or subpeona.

Our web site may contain links to other web sites. We have no control over the privacy practices of such other web sites nor should the link be considered an endorsement of such other web sites' privacy practices. We recommend that you read the privacy policies of such other websites.

**SECURITY**  
  
When a user pays for an instrument or places an order online (using the [www.cpp.com](http://www.cpp.com/) or online.cpp.com, [www.skillsone.com](http://www.skillsone.com/)), the user's personal information and credit card information are processed and encrypted by offsite, secure servers: Verisign.com and cybercash.com, using industry-standard SSL encryption. SSL is short for Secure Sockets Layer, a protocol developed by Netscape for transmitting private documents via the Internet.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at privacy@cpp.com. 

Note:  SSL is not used on the discovery.skillsone.com, [www.fulfillment.cpp.com](http://www.fulfillment.cpp.com/), [www.cppsurvey.com](http://www.cppsurvey.com/) and [www.response.cpp.com](http://www.response.cpp.com/) websites because sensitive personal information is not collected on those sites.  
   
  
**CHILDREN'S USE OF THE WEB SITE**  
  
CPP recognizes the importance of children's safety and privacy on the Internet. For that reason, and in compliance with applicable laws, we do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from, nor do we offer any content targeted to children. We ask that children under the age of thirteen do not use our web site, as it is not targeted to children.  
  
   
  
**WILL CPP DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS TO OUTSIDE PARTIES?**  
  
We do not share, sell, trade or rent or otherwise give to any other entity or organization the individual information our customers submit when placing an order or taking an instrument on our site except as noted in this privacy policy. CPP does provide its customers with the individual information they need to properly counsel or advise their clients. In other words if you are taking an instrument on our site at the direction of a consultant, counselor or other individual, that consultant, counselor or other individual will receive, from CPP, individually identifiable information so that he or she may properly counsel or advise you.

From time to time, CPP will provide its approved distributors in international markets with a list of customers, including name and contact information, residing in that distributor’s CPP-approved area of distribution.  CPP will do so only when it reasonably believes that providing such information will permit improved service to CPP customers in that distributor’s area, and only when the distributor’s use of such information is in accordance with CPP’s privacy policies in general.

We use outside shipping companies to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services.  Similarly, from time to time CPP uses third party vendors to assist in the preparation and mailing of its marketing materials.  These companies do not use personally identifiable information for any other purposes other than those directed by CPP, Inc.

If a customer neglects to pay amounts due and owing to CPP, CPP may send that CPP Customer’s name, contact information and account information to a third party vendor for collection of overdue payments.

Other than the above, if we provide a third party with client information, it will be in the form of aggregate data and used for the purposes of product development, research or statistical analysis. The information will remain anonymous, stripped of all personally identifiable data and compiled among all of our visitors' answers to survey questions and instrument responses as well as grouped on-site behavior. Again, all identifiable individual information will be removed.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web sites.

CPP may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law; (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements; or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of CPP, our users, or others. 

If you need to delete, update or correct the personal information that you have provided to CPP, please send an email to [custserv@cpp.com](mailto:custserv@cpp.com).  You can expect a response to your request within 30 days.
