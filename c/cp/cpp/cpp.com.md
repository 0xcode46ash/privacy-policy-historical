**COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET**  
Our Web site may log a user's IP address, browser type and version, dial-up domain, and computer operating system when he or she visits the site. IP addresses may in some cases be linked to personally identifiable information. We use the tracked information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. IP addresses of our Web site users are used to diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. IP addresses may also be used to gather broad demographic information—information that is not associated with any individual, and is anonymous. 

Our Web site uses an order form for customers to purchase products and services. We collect customers' contact information (such as their name, address, and e-mail address) and financial information (such as their account or credit card numbers). We verify our customer-provided credit card information with a third party prior to order processing. 

Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to our customers. We also provide mailings and other marketing collateral regarding product information and releases. We also conduct surveys during which non-personally identifiable information is collected. This information will not be used other than to garner survey results. Users may opt out of receiving any of the surveys by contacting CPP by e-mail, mail, or phone as noted above or by selecting the appropriate option during account setup or modification once they are logged into their account. We reserve the right to aggregate or compile and use data obtained from the scoring or other processing of products listed on this site or otherwise sold or licensed by CPP, and to utilize these data for research, product development, and statistical analysis. Be assured that such data are used in aggregate only and never disclose any individual's identity. 

If a user chooses to sign up to receive a CPP newsletter, that user will be able to unsubscribe from that newsletter by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in the newsletter, by e-mailing CPP Customer Relations at custserv@cpp.com, or by mailing CPP Customer Relations at CPP, Inc., 1055 Joaquin Road, Suite 200, Mountain View, CA 94043. 

CPP collects the name and e-mail address of the end user (the assessment taker) for the sole purpose of providing CPP’s customers with assessment results. CPP does not share this information with any third parties (other than the test administrator). 

Certain federal, state, local, or other government regulations may require that we disclose personally identifiable information about you. In such cases, we will use reasonable efforts to disclose only the information required under applicable law, such as in response to a court order or subpoena. 

Our Web site may contain links to other Web sites. We have no control over the privacy practices of such other Web sites, nor should the link be considered an endorsement of such other Web sites' privacy practices. We recommend that you read the privacy policies of such other Web sites. 

**COOKIES**  
Our Web site also uses "cookies." Cookies are small data files that certain Web sites write to a user's hard drive during a visit. A cookie file tracks information as the user visits pages within the site. This information will be used to improve the user's online experience by delivering content specific to the user's interests. Users have the choice to accept, reject, or be notified when a site sets a cookie by configuring their browser preferences. 

CPP’s Web sites use cookies as follows:

[www.skillsone.com](https://www.skillsone.com/): Two cookies are used on this site. The first cookie stores the user’s account information and eligibility to purchase but is destroyed when the user logs out, or when the browser window is closed. The second cookie is used for order processing from the www.skillsone.com site and does not include any personally identifiable information.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**  
Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 

**Flash LSO**  
We or our partners also use flash cookies, also known as “local shared objects,” on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site’s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at [macromedia.com](http://www.macromedia.com/). 

**Data Retention**  
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at [custserv@cpp.com](mailto:custserv@cpp.com). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

**Public Forums**  
Web sites [www.cppiconsuccess.com](http://www.cppiconsuccess.com/), and [www.mbtitalk.com](http://www.mbtitalk.com/) offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [privacy@cpp.com](mailto:privacy@cpp.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. 

**SECURITY**  
When a user pays for an instrument or places an order online (using [www.cpp.com](https://web.archive.org/), [online.cpp.com](http://online.cpp.com/), or [ www.skillsone.com](http://www.skillsone.com/)), the user's personal information and credit card information are processed and encrypted by off-site, secure servers, verisign.com and paypal.com, using industry-standard SSL encryption. SSL is short for Secure Sockets Layer, a protocol developed by Netscape for transmitting private documents via the Internet. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can e-mail us at [privacy@cpp.com](mailto:privacy@cpp.com). 

Note: SSL is not used on the [www.mbtiresearch.skillsone.com](http://www.mbtiresearch.skillsone.com/), [www.fulfillment.cpp.com](http://www.fulfillment.cpp.com/), and [www.cppsurvey.com](http://www.cppsurvey.com/) web sites because sensitive personal information is not collected on those sites. 

**CHILDREN'S USE OF THE WEB SITE**   
CPP recognizes the importance of children's safety and privacy on the Internet. For that reason, and in compliance with applicable laws, we do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from, nor do we offer any content targeted to children. We ask that children under the age of thirteen do not use our web site, as it is not targeted to children. 

**WILL CPP DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS TO OUTSIDE PARTIES?**   
We do not share, sell, trade, or rent or otherwise give to any other entity or organization the individual information our customers submit when placing an order or taking an instrument on our sites except as noted in this privacy policy. CPP does provide its customers with the individual information they need to properly counsel or advise their clients. In other words, if you are taking an instrument on our site at the direction of a consultant, counselor, or other individual, that consultant, counselor, or other individual will receive, from CPP, individually identifiable information so that he or she may properly counsel or advise you. 

From time to time, CPP will provide its approved distributors in international markets with a list of customers, including name and contact information, residing in that distributor’s CPP-approved area of distribution. CPP will do so only when it reasonably believes that providing such information will permit improved service to CPP customers in that distributor’s area, and only when the distributor’s use of such information is in accordance with CPP’s privacy policies in general. 

CPP uses Salesforce.com for customer relationship management. We provide customer data to salesforce.com so that it can provide us with customer relationship management services. Salesforce.com does not use personally identifiable information for any purposes other than those directed by CPP, Inc.

We use outside shipping companies to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. Similarly, from time to time CPP uses third-party vendors to assist in the preparation and mailing of its marketing materials. These companies do not use personally identifiable information for any purposes other than those directed by CPP, Inc. 

If a customer neglects to pay amounts due and owing to CPP, CPP may send that CPP customer’s name, contact information, and account information to a third-party vendor for collection of overdue payments. 

Other than as stated above, if CPP provides a third party with client information, it will be in the form of aggregate data and used for the purposes of product development, research, or statistical analysis. The information will remain anonymous, stripped of all personally identifiable data, and compiled among all of our visitors' answers to survey questions and instrument responses as well as grouped on-site behavior. Again, all identifiable individual information will be removed. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web sites. 

CPP may release account information when it believes, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law; (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of its user agreements; or (iii) protect the rights, property, or safety of CPP, its users, or others. 

If you need to delete, update, or correct the personal information that you have provided to CPP, please send an e-mail to [custserv@cpp.com](mailto:custserv@cpp.com). You can expect a response to your request within 30 days. 

**SUMMARY**   
CPP is committed to protecting its customers' privacy. We use the information collected on our sites to improve our products, your experience, and scientific study.
