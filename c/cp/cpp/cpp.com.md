Privacy Policy

|  **YOUR PRIVACY**  
---  
CPP, Inc. and Davies-Black® Publishing strive to protect your privacy. We work diligently to protect confidentiality, restrict transfer of personal data, incorporate technical safeguards and appropriate security policies, and identify privacy implications in new services. To that end, we would like you to know how we use the personal information you entrust to us.   
   
**COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET**  
  
Our web site may log a user's IP address, browser type and version, dial-up domain, and computer operating system when he/she visits the site. IP addresses may in some cases be linked to personally identifiable information. We use the tracked information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. IP addresses of our web site users are used to diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site. IP addresses may also be used to gather broad demographic information-information that is not associated with any individual, and is anonymous.

Our web site uses an order form for customers to purchase products and services. We collect customers' contact information (such as their address and email address) and financial information (such as their account or credit card numbers).

Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to our customers. We may also provide future mailings regarding product information and releases. We may also conduct surveys or run contests during which similar information will be collected and used for the same purposes listed above. Users may opt out of receiving any of these by selecting the appropriate option during account setup or modification. We reserve the right to aggregate or compile and use data obtained from the scoring or other processing of products listed on this site or other wise sold or licensed by CPP, and to utilize this data for research, product development, and statistical analysis. Be assured that such data is only used in aggregate and never discloses any individual's identity.

Certain federal, state, local or other government regulations may require that we disclose personally identifiable information about you. In such cases, we will use reasonable efforts to disclose only the information required under applicable law.

Our web site may contain links to other web sites. We have no control over the privacy practices of such other web sites nor should the link be considered an endorsement of such other web sites' privacy practices. We recommend that you read the privacy policies of such other websites.  
   
**COOKIES**  
Our web site also uses "cookies." Cookies are small data files that certain web sites write to a user's hard drive during a visit. A cookie file tracks information as the user visits pages within the site. This information will be used to improve the user's online experience by delivering content specific to the user's interests. Users have the choice to accept, reject or be notified when a site sets a cookie by configuring their browser preferences.   
   
**SECURITY**  
When a user pays for an instrument or places an order online, the user's personal information and credit card information are processed and encrypted by offsite, secure servers: Verisign.com and cybercash.com, using industry-standard SSL encryption. SSL is short for Secure Sockets Layer, a protocol developed by Netscape for transmitting private documents via the Internet.   
   
**CHILDREN'S USE OF THE WEB SITE**  
CPP recognizes the importance of children's safety and privacy on the Internet. For that reason, and in compliance with applicable laws, we do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from, nor do we offer any content targeted to children. We ask that children under the age of thirteen do not use our web site, as it is not targeted to children.  
   
**WILL CPP DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS TO OUTSIDE PARTIES?**  
  
We do not sell, trade or rent or otherwise give to any other entity or organization the individual information our customers submit when placing an order or taking an instrument on our site except as noted in this privacy policy. CPP does provide its customers with the individual information they need to properly counsel or advise their clients. In other words if you are taking an instrument on our site at the direction of a consultant, counselor or other individual, that consultant, counselor or other individual will receive, from CPP, individually identifiable information so that he or she may properly counsel or advise you.

In addition, from time to time, CPP may provide its approved distributors in international markets with a list of customers, including name and contact information, residing in that distributor’s territory.  It is CPP’s hope that in this way CPP’s customers in international markets will be better served with territory appropriate contacts and products.

Other than the above, if we provide a third party with client information, it will be in the form of aggregate data and used for the purposes of product development, research or statistical analysis. The information will remain anonymous, stripped of all personally identifiable data and compiled among all of our visitors' answers to survey questions and instrument responses as well as grouped on-site behavior. Again, all identifiable individual information will be removed.

CPP may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law; (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements; or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of CPP, our users, or others.
