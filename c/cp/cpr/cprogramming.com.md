# Cprogramming.com: Privacy Policy

### Privacy policy

Keeping you informed of our information gathering practices and our policy for how we use that information is important to us at Cprogramming.com. Below, you can find the ways in which we gather data and the ways that we use that data. 

####  Information Collection

##### Log files

The server stores your host, your operating system, your browser, and referring page in the server's log file when you access Cprogramming.com. This information is stored, by default, by most websites. We do not use this information to track individual users; these log files are analyzed by statistical packages to determine trends in visitor patterns, such as which pages are most popular and which referrers send the most visitors. Your host name is used only to determine statistics about the site's percentages of traffic from various countries. 

##### Message Board

You are asked but not required to register when you use the message board. You are not required to give your personal information when signing up and creating a profile. We do not use the information in visitor profiles for any purpose. The message board also tracks IP addresses of visitors. We do not use this information to track individuals, except in cases of visitors spamming the message board. If you register to use the message board, you will be asked for an email address; we do not, and do not intend to, sell your email address to spam houses. 

##### BURST!Media

You are asked, but not required, to fill out a survey by BURST!Media. The information you give will help us choose more appropriate advertisements for the site, which will benefit visitors in the long run. 

##### Mailing list

You may choose to sign up for the Cprogramming.com mailing list. If you do so, Cprogramming.com will send you periodic email related to learning about C and C++ programming. Your email address is provided only to us and to the service that runs the mailing list software. We will not sell your email address or share it with anyone else. Each mailing list email contains information on how to unsubscribe. You may unsubscribe from the mailing list at any time.

####  Information Usage

We do not track individual users on the site, except in extreme cases to respond to persistent attacks on the system, such as when a user spams the message board or hacks the site. We use the information obtained from the server logs to improve the layout of the site and to make educated guesses as to what could be improved. We also use demographics data obtained through BURST!Media's voluntary survey to target ads that are appropriate for our visitors.
