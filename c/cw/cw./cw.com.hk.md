###  What personally identifiable information does this Web site collect from me and how is the information used? 

IDG Hong Kong’s family of Web sites occasionally collects personal identifying information about you, such as your name, title, address, phone number, fax number, and/or e-mail address. This information is generally requested when you fill out a survey request form, subscription form, send us feedback on our site, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. 

IDG Hong Kong logs the IP addresses of all visitors. This data is used solely for the purpose of analyzing traffic on IDG Hong Kong’s Web sites. IDG Hong Kong makes no attempt to link these IP addresses with personal information, such as names or e-mail addresses, under any circumstance. 

###  What are cookies and how are they used? 

Cookies are small files that contain information that a Web site uses for tracking purposes. At present, IDG Hong Kong uses cookies to identify unique visitors and monitor traffic patterns within our Web site. No effort is made to link this information with an actual person. 

###  Who does IDG share my personal information with? 

As a general rule, IDG Hong Kong does not share your personal information with third parties. 

IDG Hong Kong may use personal information in the aggregate for marketing and promotional purposes. In addition, IDG Hong Kong may share personal information collected in connection with a sweepstakes or contest with a third-party sponsor of that contest or sweepstakes, if applicable. However, personal information may be shared with the individual sponsor of a contest, promotion, or sweepstake, and only if the participant specifically asks to receive additional information from a specific sponsor and for the purposes of administering the contest and notifying the winners. 

However, IDG Hong Kong occasionally informs registered users and mail-list subscribers of special deals, new products, and other third-party product and service offers that it believes they will find interesting. IDG Hong Kong mail-list subscribers are given the option to opt out of receiving such mailings during the registration process. 

You may request that your information not be used for such purposes by sending an e-mail request to IDG Hong Kong’s Webmaster at [webmasterhk@idg.com.hk](mailto:webmaster@idg.com.hk). Under no circumstances are e-mail lists made available to known spammers, get-rich-quick sites, or pornographic sites. 

###  How can I correct or make changes to my personal information? 

Subscribers to mail-list services can change or delete their personal identifying information by visiting the sites and clicking on the appropriate Unsubscribe or Change Subscription buttons. For all other changes, please contact IDG Hong Kong’s Webmaster at [webmasterhk@idg.com.hk](mailto:webmaster@idg.com.hk). 

###  What choices and rights are available to me regarding the collection, use, and distribution of my personal information?
