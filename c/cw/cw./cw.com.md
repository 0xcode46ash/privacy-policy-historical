# Privacy | Cable&Wireless Worldwide

Cable&Wireless Worldwide takes its responsibilities towards the security of your information very seriously. We are also committed to safeguarding your privacy whilst providing you with a professional and personalised service.

This statement explains how Cable&Wireless Worldwide use your personal information when providing that service and what steps we take to look after it.

We may update this Statement from time to time. If we do, material changes will be notified on our website at least 30 days prior to any change being implemented.

## What type of personal information might we collect?

To help us provide you with great customer service we need to be able to identify you and distinguish you from our other customers or clients. To do this we may ask you for your name, address, telephone number, email address, job title and possibly date of birth. If we need any further personal information we will tell you at the time why we are asking for it and wherever possible give you choices about how it is used.

## How we collect your personal information

We will collect information from you when you use our enquiry and registration forms, or when we make direct personal contact (for example, by email or over the phone) in order to conduct business with you.

When you contact our Customer Service Centres we may also carry out call recording for training and quality purposes and occasionally gather some limited personal information as a result.

## How we use your information

Cable&Wireless Worldwide will only use your information because it is relevant to our dealings with you i.e. for the provision of the goods and/or services that you have requested from us; so it may be used for things such as billing, customer services, reporting and network management, depending on our relationship with you.

Your information may be shared with the business partners and third party suppliers that we have carefully selected to provide services in partnership with us or on our behalf. We will not disclose your details to any other third party without your consent or unless we are required to do so by law.

## Marketing

Cable&Wireless Worldwide may also use the information you provide to us to keep you up to date and tell you about our products and services; this may include details about our third party partners' products and services as well as invitations to participate in customer surveys.

We will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others.

You will be able to choose the way you would like us to contact you (for example, by post, e-mail, telephone or fax). We will only contact you using your chosen method(s) and of course, you can change your preferences or opt-out of receiving further marketing communications at any point.

## How we use cookies

A cookie is a piece of text that a website transfers onto your computer or other browsing equipment, so that that website can remember who you are. It will typically contain the name of the website from which the cookie has come, the lifetime of the cookie and a value.

It does not give us access to the rest of your computer or portable media, and only the site that created the cookie can read it. Our cookies cannot be used by themselves to make you personally identifiable but they make the interaction between you and our websites faster and easier.

If you prefer not to receive cookies from Cable&Wireless Worldwide's website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser but this may impair your experience of Cable&Wireless Worldwide's website.

## How we protect your information

Cable&Wireless Worldwide takes its responsibilities towards all its information very seriously and we have robust security and data protection compliance measures in place to make sure your personal information is protected against unauthorized or unlawful disclosures or accidental or unlawful loss.

Cable&Wireless Worldwide operates internationally so we may transfer your personal information to other Cable&Wireless Worldwide companies and selected business partners and third party suppliers that are located in other countries around the world. We will only do this where you have agreed we can do so or because it is necessary as part of our business dealings with you. The laws of other countries may not be the same as those that regulate the use of personal information in your home country. However, our colleagues and suppliers are obliged to comply with our data protection and security policies regardless of their location, which means your information will be protected wherever it might be.

What happens if you are unhappy about how we use your personal information? In the first instance you should get in touch with your local Cable&Wireless Worldwide contact or office, however, if your complaint is not resolved to your complete satisfaction, you should contact our Data Protection Officer who is located at Waterside House, Longshot Lane, Bracknell, Berkshire, UK, RG12 1XL or email [Ask Data Protection](mailto:askdataprot@cwmsg.cwplc.com).

If we still cannot resolve your complaint, it will be escalated. Any finding of misuse of your information by Cable&Wireless will be remedied as soon as reasonably possible.
