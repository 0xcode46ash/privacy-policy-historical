With your consent, Cable & Wireless will use your personal data for direct marketing, including the provision of offers for Cable & Wireless and its third party partners’ products and services and customer surveys.

Cable & Wireless will only use your personal data in a way that is fair and lawful taking into account your consent, the extent to which it is necessary for Cable & Wireless to use your personal data in its dealings with you and the purposes which are disclosed to you in this Privacy Policy or which are relevant to the reason for your giving your personal data to us.  Cable & Wireless will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others.

Cable & Wireless may disclose your personal data to carefully selected business partners and third party suppliers to whom we engage to provide services.  However, other than as set out in this Privacy Policy, Cable & Wireless will not disclose or share your personal data with any other third party without your express consent unless this is necessary to provide the services or products which you requested when providing us with your personal data or as required by law.
