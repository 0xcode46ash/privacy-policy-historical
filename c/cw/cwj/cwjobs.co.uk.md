At CWJobs.co.uk we make every effort to comply with our obligations under the 1998 Data Protection Act. Additionally, we understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of your CV and other information stored about you while using the site. 

You can remove any of the information that CWJobs.co.uk stores about you, at any time, by logging in to your 'My CWJobs' account and choosing to close the account. 

_Privacy policy update (19 September 2011)_

**Registration details**   
Contact and other details you supply as part of the registration process are stored by us and used to provide you with the information you have requested. 

**Profile and CV information**   
When you complete your CWJobs.co.uk profile, including your CV, it can be made available for searching, viewing over the Internet and downloading by any direct recruiter, employment consultant or other person or organisation who requests CVs matching your profile to be sent to them. CWJobs.co.uk does not verify the identity or the nature of the business of such organisations. 

**IMPORTANT:** Your current employer may be a customer of CWJobs.co.uk, or a client of one of our customers. CWJobs.co.uk cannot restrict the customers who access profiles on our database and cannot be held responsible for any eventuality. As part of the registration process CWJobs.co.uk offers you the option of remaining anonymous. 

CWJobs.co.uk will also use the aggregate data to identify employment trends across different industries, such as salary averages. This information will not be capable of being linked to any personally identifying information about users. 

Some of our customers may be located in countries outside the European Economic Area. 

When you 'apply online', we store some information about you in your 'my CWJobs' area, but it is protected by your password and may only be accessed by you. It does not form part of our CWJobs.co.uk candidate database and cannot be searched or accessed by CWJobs.co.uk customers. You can delete your 'my CWJobs' account at any time. Your CV can only be viewed by a CWJobs.co.uk customer if you have consented to this within the profile section. 

If you choose to create a profile and upload a CV to our database, we rely on you to ensure that your details are kept up to date. You should update your CV at least every six months, particularly if your contact details have changed. 

Please note that CWJobs.co.uk reserves the right to remove from our database, CVs which include any content that we consider to be illegal or offensive. 

**Cookies**   
Cookies are small pieces of information stored by us on your computer which enable us to identify your computer when you access the CWJobs.co.uk web site and to provide you with a convenient means of access. The cookies we use also protect the integrity of registered user names and passwords and limit access to 'paid for' services. We also use cookies to collect aggregate statistical information about the use of our site (see **Statistical information** below). 

There is no personally identifiable information held on cookies. An example of a cookie is below.

You have the option to decline or accept these cookies, but if you decline you will not be able to access the personalised areas of the site. This means you will not be able to access your candidate profile, register your CV or set up any jobs by emails. 

**We strongly recommend you accept cookies.**

In addition, the third party companies who sell and provide advertisements to the site, and host our contacts database, make use of cookies for the purpose of serving and targeting advertisements more effectively. For more information about these cookies, how you can opt out of receiving them and how this will affect your use of web sites in general, please visit the websites of our third party suppliers: [Adtech](http://www.adtech.info/en/cookie_opt-out.html), [Atlas](http://www.atlassolutions.com/privacy.aspx), [Emediate](http://www.emediate.dk/privacy.html), [Webtrends](https://ondemand.webtrends.com/privacypolicy.asp), [Criteo](http://www.criteo.com/en/privacy-policy), [Google](http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/privacy/ads/) and [Epsilon](http://www.epsilon.com/Privacy-Policy/p42-l1). 

**IP address information**   
Like many websites, we routinely capture your IP address information to determine your location. This helps us work out whether you are visiting the site from within the UK, EU or rest of the world, and means we can show you content that's specific to your location and ask the right questions about your eligibility to work in the UK or EU should you wish to apply for a job on CWJobs.co.uk. 

An IP address, or 'internet protocol address', is a unique identifying number given to every device connected to the internet. Like a car license plate, an IP address is a special serial number used for identification. 

**Statistical information**   
We provide aggregate statistical information about site visitors and users to recruiters (such as the number of CVs on the database, or the number of visitors to the site) and for other lawful purposes. We provide this information to customers, advertisers, suppliers and other reputable third parties. This will not include any information that enables them to identify individuals. 

**Security**   
The site is protected against unauthorised access using the latest security devices and 'firewalls'
