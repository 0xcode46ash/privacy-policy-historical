# Privacy policy - CWJobs.co.uk

At CWJobs.co.uk we make every effort to comply with our obligations under the 1998 Data Protection Act. Additionally, we understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of your CV and other information stored about you while using the site. 

You can remove any of the information that CWJobs.co.uk stores about you, at any time, by logging in to your 'My CWJobs' account and choosing to close the account. 

_Privacy policy update (1 August, 2006)_

**Registration details**   
Contact and other details you supply as part of the registration process are stored by us and used to provide you with the information you have requested. 

**Profile and CV information**   
When you complete your CWJobs.co.uk profile, including your CV, it can be made available for searching, viewing over the Internet and downloading by CWJobs.co.uks' customers. Customers who request CVs matching your profile to be sent to them, will receive your CV and profile via email or CD Rom. These may be direct recruiters, employment consultants or other organisations. 

**IMPORTANT:** Your current employer may be a customer of CWJobs.co.uk, or a client of one of our customers. CWJobs.co.uk cannot restrict the customers who access profiles on our database and cannot be held responsible for any eventuality. As part of the registration process CWJobs.co.uk offers you the option of remaining anonymous. 

CWJobs.co.uk will also use the aggregate data to identify employment trends across different industries, such as salary averages. This information will not be capable of being linked to any personally identifying information about users. 

Some of our customers may be located in countries outside the European Economic Area. 

When you 'apply online', we store some information about you in your 'my CWJobs' area, but it is protected by your password and may only be accessed by you. It does not form part of our CWJobs.co.uk candidate database and cannot be searched or accessed by CWJobs.co.uk customers. You can delete your 'my CWJobs' account at any time. Your CV can only be viewed by a CWJobs.co.uk customer if you have consented to this within the profile section. 

If you choose to create a profile and upload a CV to our database, we rely on you to ensure that your details are kept up to date. You should update your CV at least every six months, particularly if your contact details have changed. 

Please note that CWJobs.co.uk reserves the right to remove from our database, CVs which include any content that we consider to be illegal or offensive.
