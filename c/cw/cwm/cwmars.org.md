**C/W MARS Internet Policy**

The C/W MARS network is a multitype automated library consortium that facilitates efficient resource sharing and rapid access to information for users of its member libraries through the provision of high quality computer and support services.

C/W MARS provides information services, including access to the Internet, to meet the needs of its member library patrons. The Internet offers a wealth of information that enables libraries to augment library materials. While much of the information on the Internet is professionally and culturally enriching, there may be material that is offensive to some individuals, or that may be illegal. C/W MARS assumes no responsibility for Internet content, including information that may be inaccurate or out-of-date.

C/W MARS endorses the ALA Library Bill of Rights, its interpretations, and in particular [Access to Electronic Information, Services and Networks](http://www.ala.org/alaorg/oif/electacc.html). C/W MARS does not control or monitor material available on the Internet. Parents and guardians, not the member libraries or their staff, are responsible for information accessed by their children. For those individuals who want more control for themselves or their own children, further information is available on the C/W MARS homepage under [Internet Safety Tips](http://www.cwmars.org/links/internet.html#safety).

C/W MARS member library patrons and staff must follow the policies of this Network and its Internet Service Provider, the University of Massachusetts University Information Systems. Prohibited use includes:

  * Using the Internet for illegal purposes

  * Using the Internet in violation of the Massachusetts General Law 272 Section 31, the Harmful to Minors statute.

  * Unauthorized copying of copyright-protected material in any format

  * Transmission of chain mail, broadcast letters, or junk mail of any type

  * Transmission of threatening, harassing, defamatory or obscene materials

  * Unauthorized access to remote computer systems




Each member library is responsible for informing its patrons of prohibited uses and reporting any violations of this policy to the C/W MARS Executive Director. If the member library believes criminal activity has occurred, the local authorities should also be notified. In the event that any of the prohibited activities occur, C/W MARS may suspend or terminate Internet access to that library until such time that the library implements procedures to stop this activity. Whenever practical, C/W MARS will provide the library advance notice and an opportunity to address the problem.

C/W MARS does not provide individual e-mail accounts to library users.

Individual C/W MARS libraries may have local Internet policies that may apply in addition to this policy.

C/W MARS is committed to the protection of patron privacy in their use of the Internet. See the Privacy Policy.

**C/W MARS Privacy Policy**

C/W MARS is committed to the protection of patron privacy. The Network does not require personal information to use the online catalog, electronic databases, or the Internet. C/W MARS keeps no permanent record of the Internet sites visited by library patrons, the electronic databases accessed, or the searches performed by individual patrons. In accordance with Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 78 Section 7: "That part of the records of a public library which reveals the identity and intellectual pursuits of a person using such library shall not be a public record â€¦ " C/W MARS considers circulation and registration records identifying the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of library patrons, as well as the materials borrowed or accessed electronically, not to be part of the public record. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (P.L. 107- 56) supercedes state law and expands the federal government's authority for access to library records and documents to protect against international terrorism and clandestine intelligence activities. It also expands federal law enforcements' authorization to track telephone and electronic communication, including any dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information and the actual content of the communication. 

C/W MARS collects no personal information about users of the Internet, electronic databases, or the online catalog, unless patrons choose to provide it. This information will be used only to enhance the patron's use of the library and the online card catalog. It will not be shared with third parties without the explicit permission of the patron. Library patrons should be aware that C/W MARS and other Massachusetts library organizations license commercial databases from a variety of vendors. The Network will make every effort to restrict electronic database vendors from collecting and using identifying personal information of its library users, however it provides no guarantee that personal information will not be shared with third parties.

The intellectual pursuits of individuals using library or Internet resources are considered confidential information regardless of the age of the borrower. Such records shall not be made available to any individual or agency except pursuant to such process, order, subpoena or warrant as may be authorized under the authority of, and pursuant to, federal, state, or local law relating to civil, criminal, or administrative discovery procedures or legislative investigative power.

Upon receipt of such process, order, or subpoena, the Executive Director will notify the C/W MARS Executive Committee, except when prohibited by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and consult with the Network attorney to determine if such process, order, or subpoena is in proper form and if there is evidence of good cause for its issuance. If the process, order, or subpoena is not in proper form or if good cause has not been shown, such defects must be corrected before the information is provided. The Network recognizes that a legal search warrant must be honored immediately, however the library or affected patron(s) may challenge the warrant after the fact.

Member Library Directors and C/W MARS staff should refer all formal requests for circulation, registration, or usage records to the Executive Director.

Individual C/W MARS libraries may have local Privacy policies that may apply in addition to this policy. 

See the Internet Policy.
