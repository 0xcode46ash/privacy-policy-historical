CND Privacy Statement

Thank you for supporting the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. The abolition of nuclear weapons is a huge task and we need all the help we can get. That's why your support is so valuable to us and why we ask your permission to keep your data on hand and to let you know from time to time of all the different ways you can help. The information you provide CND with will be added to our membership and supporter database and will be used for CND purposes only. These purposes may include, but are not limited to, mailing of CND publications, administering membership, information on benefits and services to members, information regarding the campaign, events and fundraising. We only hold information that is required for CND to fulfil its campaigning and membership activities, such as home address, e-mail address, and bank details. We aim to keep this information as accurate and up-to-date as possible, and ask your assistance in ensuring this is so. We will also do everything we can to prevent this information from being used in any unauthorised or unlawful way, and will never pass it on to anyone not mentioned here.

Data is available to recognised regional and local CND Groups, and to agents contracted by CND for particular projects. Data may also be used for fundraising programmes, which might include appealing to you directly. On occasion data may be passed to other organisations with which we have a reciprocal arrangement. Data may only be held with your consent, and you have the right to request details of data CND holds on you for a small administration fee.

Under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998 you have the right to object to the use of your data for any of the above purposes. Furthermore, you have the option to tick the opt-out box on all membership forms, or to inform CND in writing, if you do not wish to be sent CND fundraising appeals or for your information to be passed on to other organisations with which we may have a reciprocal relationship. If you prefer that we stop using your information for the purpose of contacting you about campaigning and membership activities, or if you feel we are using information about you in any way which you believe may cause you or another person damage or distress, you can contact us at the address below to request that your records are no longer used in this way. If you would like to know more about how we are complying with the Data Protection Act, or to request a copy of the information we hold on you, please write to Data Protection, CND, 162 Holloway Road, London N7 8DQ or phone on 020 7700 2393. If you would like us to send you a copy of the information we hold on you, please send a cheque for £5 payable to CND.
