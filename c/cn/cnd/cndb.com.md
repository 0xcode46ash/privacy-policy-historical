At CNDB.com, we respect and protect your privacy. Our site is a safe environment for anyone who visits and becomes a member or purchases items from us. As an entertainment-related products and services provider, we are committed to providing you the best possible online service and experience, as well as the best products. The purpose of this policy statement is to fully share with you how we feel about the most important aspects of using this site. 

#### What information does CNDB.com collect and how is it used?

**A.** When you visit the CNDB.com site, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes which pages are visited and any feedback from our visitors. We then aggregate this information with thousands of other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible. 

**B.** Our site will eventually use cookies to speed navigation, keep track of items, and provide you with custom-tailored content. We also use cookies to remember information you gave us so you don't have to reenter it each time you visit the site. By showing us how and when visitors use the site, cookies also help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on data such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.

Username  
Password  
Email address  


#### We use this information as follows:

  1. The e-mail address members supply us with is never sold to any other website owner or merchant. We hate junk mail as much as you do. This is why we will only send you e-mail about items that we feel you should know about. This includes special promotional items that we endorse, membership changes, terms and conditions changes, Holiday cards, and as always, the latest happenings on CNDB.com. If you would like not to be notified by e-mail or would like to change you e-mail address, please send us a note with the customer service form and let us know how we can best serve you. 
  2. The Username and Password will be used for you to login to your reviewer account to make additions, subtractions and edits. 



#### Special Promotional Offers

From time to time, CNDB.com would like to share with you special promotional offers from other companies, which have been specially screened by us. These offers would provide valuable savings to you. All CNDB.com customers will be given the opportunity to not receive these offers if they prefer, simply send us a note with the customer service form and let us know you would not like to be notified of special offers and promotions. 

#### How does CNDB.com protect the privacy of children younger than 18?

CNDB.com supports all the efforts of the current on-line movement to restrict access to adult content sites. We support efforts to restrict access but do not believe that the so-called age verification services that are available today are more than thinly veiled attempts of entrepreneurs trying to turn a buck. We restrict the images that are available to the general visitor to fully clothed or scantily clad appearances in films by the actresses that are listed on our site. We do not want our junior visitors to be left out from the information that is available, but we do not want to contribute to their delinquency by allowing sexually oriented content to be viewed without first obtaining a credit card number as a way of verifying their age. Let's face it, if you want to get in to see the pictures, you're going to have to pay for it.
