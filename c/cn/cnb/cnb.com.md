Privacy Statement

At City National Corporation and our affiliates, we value your trust and confidence and make maintaining them a priority. We are committed to safeguarding the confidentiality and privacy of all information entrusted to us by every client. We understand you expect no less.

Federal law requires us to inform you, our consumer client, how we manage and safeguard your information. This notice describes our policy, which not only applies to our written files, but also to client information received through transactions you conduct within our banking offices, our electronic services, by telephone, online and through correspondence. 

The following information is covered in this notice:

  1. Our Commitment to You
  2. Information We Collect
  3. Disclosure of Information
  4. How We Protect You
  5. Frequency of Notices
  6. Definition of Terms
  7. City National Affiliates



1\. OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU

City National does not share any client information among affiliates or with nonaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes unless you agree we may do so, or if you have expressly requested that we provide you with certain products and services. 

We never sell any client information for any reason. As a result, at City National, you do not need to take action (“OPT-OUT”) to prevent our sharing client information. This will not change, even if you end your relationship with us for any reason. We will continue to honor and safeguard any client information and preferences that you have shared with us. 

2\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT 

To provide the kind of premier services you have come to expect from City National, we collect and maintain the following client information:

  * Name, address, Social Security number or income and other client information you provide to us on applications or other forms, in writing, electronically, or verbally. 
  * Account balances or payment history and other client information about your transactions with us. 
  * Information we obtain from consumer reporting agencies and from others with whom we work, such as publicly available information or demographics.
  * Password, Personal Identification Number and other client information about you that we obtain in connection with our efforts to protect against fraudulent or unauthorized use of our services. 



For certain applications, “cookies” may be used. Cookies are small pieces of information assigned by a Web server to the browser on your hard drive. Cookies help Web sites keep track of your preferences and recognize you as a return visitor. You may browse our Web site anonymously by choosing not to provide us with any client information during your visits. When you browse anonymously, we will not be able to link your online activity with the accounts you have with us. For all other Web sites you visit, please review their privacy policies before you accept cookies from them. 

3\. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

To effectively administer and service daily operations, most financial companies need to share client information with vendors to run everyday business. City National contracts with nonaffiliated third party vendors to provide services that include printing your checks, processing your account transactions, and providing you with online products and services. Each vendor is required to maintain the confidentiality of client information and use that information only to provide the intended services(s). We disclose client information to these vendors to:

  * Establish, administer and manage your account relationships with us. 
  * Provide our services to you.
  * Process transactions and account statements.
  * Conduct research and analysis.
  * Deliver our other benefits and programs to you.



As permitted or required by law, City National may provide client information to credit reporting agencies and to others in response to subpoenas, other legal processes, regulatory / administrative requests and in connection with suspicious or criminal transactions. However, we do not share client information from consumer reports or credit applications without your consent. 

4\. HOW WE PROTECT YOU

City National maintains the confidentiality and integrity of client information. We regularly validate our security measures through independent audits and monitor the security standards of our third party vendors. Within the bank, we limit the availability of client information to those authorized persons who need it to perform their job responsibilities, and otherwise as discussed in Section 3 (Disclosure of Information). 

Our Web sites use a full range of Internet security measures. The security architecture includes encryption technology, access control devices and firewalls that act as barriers between the outside world and the internal bank network, and trusted operation systems. City National uses anti-virus software that is designed to detect and prevent computer viruses from entering our computer network system and continually monitors for attempts to break through our security systems. 

We have designed our systems to ensure that your Personal Identification Number (PIN), password, and other access codes are always private and confidential. City National will never ask for client information through e-mail. Therefore, do not respond to any e-mail message asking for your password, PIN number, credit card validation code, bank account numbers, ATM, credit card numbers, Social Security number, or other client information.

If you should receive an e-mail requesting such client information, please notify City National as soon as possible at (800) 480-5443. 

5\. FREQUENCY OF NOTICES

Federal law requires that we notify you about our privacy practices when you open an account and every year that you are a client. We will also notify you in the event that we change our privacy policy. Although we safeguard the privacy of all our clients, this annual notice specifically applies to clients who are consumers.
