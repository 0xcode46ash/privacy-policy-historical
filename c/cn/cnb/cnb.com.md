# City National Bank: Information Center - Terms and Conditions - Privacy Statement

CITY NATIONAL BANK STATEMENT OF PRIVACY PRINCIPLES

City National Bank is a commercial bank providing business, personal and private banking, trust and investment services and other financial products to clients who expect and deserve privacy regarding their financial information and who rely upon us to maintain their privacy.

We request, obtain and retain personal information about our individual clients, potential clients and former clients as we believe necessary to understand and fulfill their financial needs and requests and to provide our products and services. We understand that maintaining information about others imposes on us the responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of such information. We are committed to keeping our clients' personal information accurate, confidential, secure and private. We understand that only by doing so will we justify the trust of our clients.

The following privacy principles will guide our conduct when we collect, use, maintain or release client information.

First, we acknowledge a moral and professional obligation to our clients to maintain the privacy of the client information entrusted to us, our legal obligations to maintain the privacy of certain client information and the fact of the existence of a client's banking relationship with us may be confidential. We will caution all our colleagues to not discuss outside our organization the existence of a client's banking relationship with us or information derived from that relationship, except in accordance with these principles. We will advise a client of any government legal process requiring disclosure by us of client information, to the extent permitted by law.

Second, we are committed to limit the collection of information about a client to information we reasonably believe we need to know in order to administer the client's account, to provide a product, service, or opportunity to a client, to offer new products and services, to protect our client and us from fraud or unauthorized transactions and to meet legal and regulatory requirements.

Third, we are committed to limit the availability of client information within our organization to those colleagues responsible for servicing the needs of a client and those colleagues who need such information to perform their duties.

Fourth, we will use technology and other means to help ensure that client information is accurate, current and complete and is processed promptly. We will require high standards of quality from the consumer reporting agencies and others who provide us with information about clients and prospective clients. We will respond promptly to a request from a client to correct inaccurate information.

Fifth, we will advise our vendors and other third parties to whom we provide client information for the purpose of providing service to a client, or for the purpose of offering products or services to a client, to adopt and adhere to privacy principles similar to these privacy principles, and to limit the use of such information to the purpose for which it is provided. We will take appropriate action to review vendor and third party compliance with applicable privacy principles. If we provide third parties the opportunity to offer products or services to our clients, we will first provide our clients the opportunity to decline to receive marketing materials regarding such offers.

Sixth, except as stated above we will limit our disclosure of client information to third parties to the following circumstances:

  1. When requested to do so by the client. 
  2. When necessary, in our opinion, to complete a client initiated transaction. 
  3. When made in accordance with standard banking industry practice to a financial institution, a reputable information reporting agency, a merchant or other similar person. 
  4. When required or permitted to do so by law or regulation, including authorized requests from government agencies and if we are the victim of fraud or otherwise suffer loss caused by the unlawful act of the client.



Seventh, we will maintain security standards and procedures in order to avoid unauthorized access to client information.

Eighth, we will educate our colleagues concerning these privacy principles and their obligations to maintain client privacy as described in this Statement and our Code of Conduct, and we will take appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce those obligations.

We reserve the right to alter or amend this Statement and any of the policies or procedures described above at any time without prior notice. These principles are for general guidance and do not constitute a contract and do not modify or amend any agreement we have with our clients.
