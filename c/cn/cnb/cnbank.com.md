Canandaigua National Corporation

##### Privacy Policy Notice

Canandaigua National Corporation recognizes its customers' expectations of financial privacy, and preserving our customers' trust is one of the core values of our bank and our family of financial service companies.  For over 110 years, respecting and protecting customer privacy has been vital to our business.

#### Our Security Procedures

We are committed to the privacy of customer information and will use strict security standards to safeguard it.  We restrict access to your personal and account information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. All of Canandaigua National Corporation and our family of financial service companies are governed by a code of conduct that includes the commitment to protect the confidentiality of customer information.  We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. 

We are equally committed to protecting the privacy of customer information on the Internet.  For information on the Internet security measures we apply, refer to our Security Architecture page at www.cnbank.com/security.html.

#### What Information We Collect

####  

#### We collect only information that is needed to serve you and administer our business.  In the process of serving you, we may collect “nonpublic personal information”—information about you that is not available publicly.  This information comes to us from various sources, including:

·         Information we receive from you on applications or other loan and account forms;

·         Information related to your transactions with us, our family of financial services companies listed below (affiliates) or others; and

·         Information we receive from third parties such as credit bureaus.

#### What Information We Disclose

We are permitted under law to share information about our experiences or transactions with you or your account (such as your account balance and your payment history with us) with companies related to us by common control or ownership (affiliates).  We also may share additional information about you or your account (such as information we receive from you in applications and information from credit reporting agencies) with our affiliates. 

You may instruct Canandaigua National Corporation not to share information (other than information related to account history and our experiences with you) within the Canandaigua National Corporation family of financial service companies, by calling us toll free at 1-800-724-2621.

We may also disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform marketing or other services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements.

We also are permitted under law to disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties (i.e., third parties that are not members of our corporate family) in limited circumstances.  For example, we may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to such third parties to assist us in servicing your loan or account with us; to government entities in response to subpoenas; and to credit bureaus.  We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you to any other third parties, except as permitted by law.

If you decide to close your account(s) or become an inactive customer, we will continue to adhere to the privacy policy and practices described in this notice.
