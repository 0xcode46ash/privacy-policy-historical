We may collect, receive and store information regarding your general use of our Services (such as details of how and when you used our Services, interactions with our Services, log in information, resources that you access, your Internet protocol address, your browser type, and your device type), as well as your user preferences.  
  
_Phone Numbers_

We may collect your phone number in several ways. For example, we may collect your phone number: 1) if you submit your phone number to us through our Services; 2) by capturing your phone number if you call us; or 3) if a Third Party provides your phone number to us.  
  
_Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers_

We and Third Parties use various technologies to collect and store information when you use our Services, including sending cookies, pixel tags or other anonymous identifiers to your device. “Cookies” are pieces of data stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device. A “pixel tag” is a type of technology placed within a website or email for the purpose of tracking activity, which is often used in combination with cookies. Other “anonymous identifiers” are random strings of characters used for the same purposes as cookies, such as with mobile devices where cookie technology is not available. These technologies help us know that you are logged on, provide you with features based on your preferences, understand when you are interacting with our Services, and compile other information regarding use of our Services. 

The information collected through these technologies, standing alone, cannot be used to determine your identity. Such information may, however, be combined in a way that makes it become personal information (e.g. information that can identify you). If this happens, we will treat the combined information as personal information. Please note that, in most cases, you can remove or block cookies by using the settings in your browser, but doing so may affect your ability to use our Services.

The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other Third Party assets (such as social media) on the Services is not covered by our Privacy Policy. These Third Parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our Services. We do not have access or control over these technologies.

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by CNAFinance.com and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use local storage objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use LSOs such as HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.

**How We Disclose Information**

_General Disclosure of Your Information_

We will share your personal information with Third Parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to Third Parties.

We may disclose Your Information: 

  * To any person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive Your Information as your agent, including as a result of your business dealings with that person (i.e., your attorney);
  * To our third-party vendors so that they may provide support for our internal and business operations, including for the handling of data processing, data verification, data storage, surveys, research, internal marketing, delivery of promotional, marketing and transaction materials, and our Services’ maintenance and security. These companies are authorized to Use Your Information only as necessary to provide these services to us and are contractually obligated to keep Your Information confidential;
  * To Third Parties such as credit card providers when you use our Services to request a quote, services, or information from one or more of those Third Parties such as by clicking “get your approval” or other similar buttons at the end of a form;
  * To Third Parties when you engage in certain activities through our Services that are sponsored by them, such as purchasing products or services offered by a Third Party, electing to receive information or communications from a Third Party, or electing to participate in programs sponsored, in whole or in part, by a Third Party. When we disclose Your Information to these Third Parties, Your Information will become subject to the information use and sharing practices of the Third Party, and the Third Party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of Your Information;
  * To Third Parties that are interested in contacting you or providing offers to you that may be related to our Services or about products or services you may find of interest; If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us at dataprotection@cnafinance.com. 
  * As required by law or ordered by a court, regulatory, or administrative agency;

  * To our affiliated companies (e.g. companies under common control or management with us).



**If you do not want Your Information shared as described above, then you should not provide us with Your Information.**  
_Requests for Approvals and Services from Third Party Service Providers_

As noted above, we may share Your Information with Requested Service Providers when you use our Services to request an approval, services or information from one or more Third Parties (a “Request”). **IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA MAIL, TELEPHONE, TEXT MESSAGE, FAX, EMAIL AND OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION. YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST THROUGH OUR SERVICES, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY.**

If you are matched with Third Party Service Providers, you expressly consent to those Service Providers conducting any research necessary to provide you with quotes for your Request. Third Party Service Providers may need to share Your Information to conduct such research. As an example, if you request approval for a credit card, consumer reports may be ordered in connection with your application. Such reports may provide information that may assist in determining eligibility for insurance and the interest rate you may be charged for the card. Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewal or extensions of this insurance. In addition, card issuers may use Third Parties in connection with the development of a “credit score” for you. **If you do not want Third Party Service Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with an approval for your Request, then you should not submit a Request**.  
**Please note that if you submit a Request through our Services and we share Your Information as described above in connection with your Request, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of Your Information in connection with that Request.**

_Aggregation and De-Personalization_

We may take Your Information and de-personalize it either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating Your Information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing Your Information). We reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell, or otherwise disclose such information to Third Parties at any time, for any lawful purpose, without notice or compensation to you. 

_Sharing with Friends_

If the Services contains any functionality allowing you to send content to a friend, then please be aware that: 1) we may display your email address to your friend; and 2) we may use information you provide about your friend to facilitate the communication and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We do not store this information, but use it for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. 

_Circumvention of Security Measures_

When you enter sensitive information (such as last four digits of your social security number), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

We cannot ensure that Your Information will only be disclosed as described in this Privacy Policy. No method of transmission or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. Additionally, by way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose Your Information to the government or Third Parties under certain circumstances, or Third Parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary within this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use or any other applicable agreement or policy, **you use our Services at your own risk** and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that Your Information will always remain private. In the event that an unauthorized Third Party compromises our security measures, we will not be responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized Third Party’s ability to view, use or disseminate Your information. 

_Business Transfers_

We specifically and expressly reserve the right to disclose, lease, sell, assign or transfer Your Information collected through our Services, and any of our databases, together with any personal information contained in such databases, to Third Parties in connection with a Business Transfer.

_****__Network Advertising_

From time to time, we may participate in or use advertising networks, such as third-party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms. We may use these third-party advertising networks for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you. Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumer’s interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer’s specific interests. This practice is often referred to as “online behavioral advertising.” For example, a third-party advertising network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or not you visit specific pages of a website, the location of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time of a visit to a website and other interactions between you and a website.
