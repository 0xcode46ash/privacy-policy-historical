# Privacy and Security Statements

ComSuper places great emphasis on maintaining and enhancing the privacy and security of your personal information. With a number of strong security measures in place and with the continued development of our online services, our main focus is on improving existing measures as well as keeping you informed about the latest developments.

## Privacy Statement:

### Collection of information

ComSuper collects a range of information about visits to its web site, including: 

  * How often the site was used;
  * The time of day the site was accessed;
  * What browser types are being used.



This information is collected for statistical analysis only, to help us improve access to the site.

ComSuper monitors and evaluates its performance against the standards set out in the [Service Charters](https://web.archive.org/pages/charters.htm). To continually improve our service we have commissioned an independent firm, ORIMA, to assess our performance against those standards. For this purpose your name, address and telephone number may be passed to ORIMA to undertake random surveys. These surveys may take the form of a telephone survey or a written request for your feedback, should you choose to participate. The information will not be used for any other purpose and ORIMA are required to protect all details collected under the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988.

### When you send a message to ComSuper

You may provide personally identifiable information such as your name, physical address and email address, when you send us a message. Personal information collected is protected by the Privacy Act 1988.

### When using online services

Currently, the only information collected using our online services is contact details and mailing preferences for the issue of superannuation information. These contact details will be held against your computer record and will only be used for the issue of superannuation information. This information is provided to a mailing contractor for the issue of superannuation information. All contractors are required to adhere to the Privacy Provisions.

### Access to information

In the unlikely event of an investigation, a law enforcement agency or other government agency may exercise its legal authority to inspect our Internet Service Provider's logs.

### Use and disclosure of information

Personal information provided when you send us a message will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it. Your details will not be added to a general mailing list. Unless required by law, we will not disclose this information without consent.

### Cookies

## Security Statement

Commonwealth laws protect your personal information. These laws prohibit any person from accessing, using or disclosing any personal information in the possession of ComSuper unless it is in the performance of their duties or is accordance with these laws. Penalties apply for failure to observe these provisions.

When using online services all information passing between your PC and the secure section of our web site is encrypted.

The encryption process used is Secure Socket Layer (SSL). For SSL encryption to work, your browser must support SSL. Freely available browsers that support SSL include Netscape version 6 and Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5.

While we endeavour to provide a secure Internet environment, users should note that there are inherent risks associated with the transmission of information via the Internet.

These include direct contact to the Contact Centre via telephone, facsimile, post or personal counselling.
