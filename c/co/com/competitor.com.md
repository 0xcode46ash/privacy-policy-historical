# Competitor Magazine Privacy Policy

**COMPETITOR.COM PRIVACY STATEMENT**

Your privacy and security are important to us. Because we gather certain types of information about competitor.com ("Competitor") users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [contact@competitor.com](mailto:contact@competitor.com). NOTE: Competitor cannot accept information from individuals who are under 14 years of age without first obtaining express parental consent. If you feel that Competitor is not abiding by this privacy statement, you should contact the webmaster by email at [contact@competitor.com](mailto:contact@competitor.com). 

**Information Collection and Use**

Competitor is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Competitor collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our sweepstakes, contests or drawings that take place. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Links**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Competitor is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Partner Sites**

Competitor is powered by Active.com, an independent online race registration portal. Any links to event sites, registration forms, contests, or other site content created and maintained by Active.com are subject to the privacy statement located at [www.active.com](http://www.active.com/). 

**Newsletter**

If a user wishes to subscribe to Competitor's newsletter, contact information such as name and email address will be required. 

**Surveys & Contests **

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

**Security**

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. Personal information collected on Competitor is stored in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [contact@competitor.com](mailto:contact@competitor.com). 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information:**

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our newsletter, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done by emailing [contact@competitor.com](mailto:contact@competitor.com). 

**Choice/Opt-out**

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out of receiving the newsletter by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at [contact@competitor.com](mailto:contact@competitor.com). 

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
