Privacy Guidelines

**Consumer Privacy  
&   
How It Affects You**

Since 1855, CompassBank has been guided by the belief that protecting each person's right to privacy is fundamental to the quality of customer relationships. Although current technology and new marketing practices have increased the amount of customer information that can be collected and shared in today's marketplace, at CompassBank, we want you to know that any personal information about you will be treated with the utmost confidence. While some information is critical to providing quality service, we recognize that one of our most important assets is our customers' trust. Rest assured that safekeeping of customer information has always been, and will always remain, a priority for CompassBank.

**_Information About You_**

Information about our customers is accumulated from a variety of sources. Some information is provided to CompassBank directly by customers themselves. Other data is obtained from outside sources, such as credit bureaus. We try to limit the use and collection of information about our customers to that which is necessary to administer our business and provide superior service, while offering products and services which we think will be of interest to customers. We may engage certain third-party providers with whom we have agreements (such as data processors, debit/credit card providers, check printers, etc.) simply to assist us in providing a broader array of financial services, which we might not otherwise be in a position to offer you.

Accuracy is important. Our goal is to maintain complete and accurate information, such as your home address, tax ID number, account balance, etc. Should you ever believe that our records contain inaccurate or incomplete information about you, please notify us. We will investigate your concerns and make every effort to correct any inaccuracies.

**_Information Sharing_**

It is CompassBank's policy not to reveal specific information about customer accounts or other personally identifiable data (non-public information) to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use, except for the exchange of information with reputable information reporting agencies, unless: (1) the customer requests or permits it, or (2) the disclosure is required by or allowed by law (e.g. subpoena, investigation of fraudulent activity, request by regulator, etc.).

When the bank conducts business with third parties, it requires them to maintain similar standards of conduct regarding the privacy of personally identifiable customer information provided to them.

**_Safeguarding Your Information_**

At CompassBank, we safeguard information according to established security standards and procedures, and we continually assess, upgrade and install new technology to protect this information. Employee access to non-public customer information is limited to those with a business reason to know such information. Employees are trained to understand and comply with this privacy policy. 

**_Ending Customer Relationships_**

If your customer relationship with us ends, we will treat the information we have about you as if you were still our customer.
