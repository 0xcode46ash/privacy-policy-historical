**Secure Internet Transactions:**  
To protect your privacy, CompactAppliance.com has teamed up with **Yahoo!Store** to provide our shopping cart technology. Our shopping cart incorporates industry-standard secure server software (Secure Socket Layers) into sensitive sections of our store. All online transactions at CompactAppliance.com are handled using this encryption technology. When you enter your credit card number into the order form, it is transmitted across the Internet in an encrypted (scrambled) form, then decoded when it gets to us. For added security, we also encrypt the credit card number when it is stored on disk.

If you are not the kind of person who worries about being hit by lightning as you're crossing the street, you probably don't have to worry that your credit card number will be intercepted on the way to a secure Web site. According to CNN,  
**"The prevalent opinion...is that on-line credit card use is actually no riskier for consumers than traditional "low-tech" transactions."**  
We order products online all the time, both as a company and as individuals. When we use a credit card to buy something online, we feel at least as safe as we would using one in a store or restaurant.

Bank One Merchant Services, a state-of-the-art credit verification service, keeps CompactAppliance.com’s transactions secure by encrypting all of your personal information -- credit card number, name, and address -- while validating the transaction. We use RSA encryption technology to scramble your data so effectively that it would be virtually impossible to break into it.

**How to Be Sure CompactAppliance.com Purchases Are Secure:**  
There are two ways to make sure you're browsing secure pages. Both Internet Explorer® (which works best with the CompactAppliance.com store) and Netscape Navigator® indicate secure modes with a symbol -- the image of a closed padlock.

You'll know the information is protected if the closed-lock symbol pops into view in the lower right- or left-hand corner of your screen while you are checking out. You can also verify secure pages by checking the address, or URL, listed on the location bar. If you spot an "s" after the "http" at the beginning of the address, you know that you're browsing in a secure environment.

**Federal Law Limits Your Liability:**  
In the unlikely event you feel your credit card information fell into the wrong hands, federal law limits your liability. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act of 1975, you can dispute the charges on your account with your credit card company -- and temporarily withhold payment while they investigate the situation. Even if your creditor disagrees that unauthorized purchases were made, you're generally only liable for the first $50 in fraudulent charges. CompactAppliance.com will take care of any fraudulent charges up to that first $50 made through us to your account.
