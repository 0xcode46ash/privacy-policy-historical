Covered Web Sites

The Privacy Policy described herein is applicable to this entire web site, including all areas where financial information is gathered and income tax data is input, printed and/or transmitted. It does not apply to any other online services, or to any other web sites published and/or maintained by us or any other service provider.

This Privacy Policy covers all the online information practices of www.completetax.com. Other sites maintained by CCH, such as www.tax.cchgroup.com and www.tax.cchgroup.com/pfx/products/CompleteTaxPro/ operate under their own Privacy and security policies.

**Please Note:** Our Service is applicable to filers of resident U.S. Federal income tax returns only, and accordingly the statements made in this Privacy Policy apply solely to residents of the United States.

Our Commitment to Data Security 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to safeguard and secure the personal information and email address we collect online.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number, or national ID) on our forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

Internal Controls

When collecting, storing and retrieving your personal data, extensive internal controls are maintained throughout the process that are designed to ensure security and confidentiality.

Our Internet-based systems are protected behind firewalls, and all mission critical servers are deployed in a cluster environment to provide an even greater level of security and protection against system failure. All data is maintained and backed-up on a regular schedule to provide adequate redundancy and as part of an effort to ensure that the integrity of information is never jeopardized.

Our employees are subject to strict guidelines regarding confidentiality, and internal access to customer data is restricted to highly trained personnel on an "as-needed" basis and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

Transmitting Information

When transmitting information between you and our server, as well as when communicating with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for electronic filing, data security is handled through a protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL is an established and mature Internet security standard with two dominant features: data encryption and web server authentication.

Use of Cookies

We use "cookies" on our websites to personalize and enhance your website visits. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by our web server. Cookies are uniquely assigned to a computer, and your computer will only allow our web servers to access our cookies. The most important thing to understand about cookies is that they pose no danger to you. They cannot be used to collect personal information about you or your computer or to provide information about you to other companies.

Cookies provide a convenience by saving you time on subsequent visits and personalizing your web experience. For example, when you return to our website, cookies enable us to remember information from prior visits such as your user ID. Cookies may save data such as name, password, user ID, screen preferences, pages viewed, and ads clicked. Credit card information and personal information is never saved in cookies.

You have the right to delete cookies placed on your hard drive, which will erase the data automatically saved during your visit. However that will mean that our sites will not recognize you when you return. You may also modify your web browser to notify you before accepting cookies, or to decline all cookies. We strongly suggest that you accept cookies from us, since they help provide you a more seamless, personalized, and effective web browsing experience and keep our site compelling and informative.

Third Party Cookies

The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. These third parties use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, in order for you to use the shopping cart. 

Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. 

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Choice and Opt-out." 

The Way We Use Information 

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information or email address with third parties, other than as disclosed within this privacy policy. 

The tax return information that we collect is used strictly for lawful purposes and is never shared with Federal, State or other taxing authorities without your consent. The foregoing notwithstanding, we reserve the right to disclose your information without your consent as required by law, and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, in response to a court order, legal process served on our Web site, subpoena, search warrant or other inquiry or request from governmental or regulatory authorities, or to protect against fraud or other criminal activities. If you choose to electronically file your return, we will transmit your tax return to the appropriate Federal and State taxing authorities. 

The IRS requires us to provide the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from which the return originated, as well as the e-mail address of the person who electronically filed the return. This information is sent to the IRS at the time you choose to submit your return to the IRS for electronic filing.

In order to electronically file your return, we must share your submitted tax information with the appropriate tax authorities in order to complete your request. You can control whether or not you wish your tax information shared for this purpose by deciding whether or not to complete the tax return forms, which are all clearly labeled.

The above listed credit card information that we collect will be used strictly for order processing and billing purposes, and will not be shared with any other party other than the credit card processing company and the IRS in order to implement your direct deposit request. When appropriate, bank account or credit card information is also passed to our bank, for processing purposes, if you choose to use our Credit Card Payment of Balance Due or Deduct Fee from Refund options. You will enter this information during the routine course of a purchase. In the event that our Internet Service staff should need to research and resolve any status or billing issues associated with an order, the information will only be accessed by authorized personnel. 

Our Basic Service entitles you to notification via e-mail of filing deadlines, estimate reminders, tax law changes, as well as tax planning and financial information that may affect your tax return. In order for us to provide you with the Basic Service, it is required that you provide us with your e-mail address.

Personally identifiable information is only shared as indicated in this document or as otherwise consented to by you in writing, subject to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

If you sign up for our newsletter, we will use your email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions in each newsletter or by clicking [this link](http://tax.cchgroup.com/cforms/newsletters/taa-unsubscribe.aspx?leadsource=unsubscribe-completetax).
