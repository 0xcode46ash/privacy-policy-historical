**Privacy Statement for Comic Book Resources**

Boiling Point Productions, the parent company of Comic Book Resources, has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: Comic Book Resources ( **CBR** ). 

**IP Address Collection**  
The **CBR** Web site logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user's session. This gives **CBR** an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a users session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous. 

**CBR's use of Cookies**  
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. **CBR** uses cookies in only two instances - when you register as a **CBR Forums** member and when you click an ad: 

Registration: when you register, **CBR** uses a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. 

We do not store any personal information about you. We use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and to track the pages you visit on our site. Cookies also enable you to enter **CBR** as a member without having to log on each time, and to visit member-restricted areas of the sites. We encrypt the user ID for added security. 

Ads: **CBR** 's advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates. 

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use any **CBR** site. 

**Advertising**  
In addition to our directly sold advertising, we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp). 

**Registration Information Usage**  
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and demographic information (like their zip code or age). We use customer contact information from the registration form to contact the user for administrative purposes only (i.e. updating their passwords, sending log-in information. etc.). Users may also opt-in to receive future offers and mailiers from CBR. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

The only personal information required of a registering user on the CBR Forums is their e-mail address. This is used only for their participation in the CBR Forums to receive e-mail notification of when a post or reply has been made to that individual user. This e-mail address is not given to third parties. When a user registers with the CBR Forums their individual IP address is collected as well. This information is only used to track that users session on the forums. Neither the e-mail address or IP address of a user under the age of 13 is disclosed to third-parties. 

CBR does not currently, nor has any plans to, accept registrations from users under the age of 13. 

If registration information is collected from a child under the age of 13, it will be deleted upon immediate notification by the legal guardian. Contact [support@comicbookresources.com](mailto:support@comicbookresources.com) to have the information removed.
