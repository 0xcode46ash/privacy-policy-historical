##  Use of "Cookies"

Cookies are implemented in various parts of the IEEE Site, such as the Electronic Catalog. In most instances, the use of Cookies is discretionary by you, and declining Cookies will usually result only in loss of certain conveniences such as session continuity and re-authentication during current or future sessions. Various types of Persistent and Per-Session (Transient) Cookies may be used with any one service, and their implementations, behaviors, and effects will vary. Most IEEE sites using Cookies have specific statements on their use as part of their Frequently Asked Questions ("FAQ") section. It is the policy of the IEEE that Cookies do not carry any of your personal information (name, email address, credit card, etc.) nor identification/password-type data that allows access to such personal information on IEEE servers. All personal, transaction, and security rights are housed on secure IEEE servers, and follow the policy described in the "Information We Collect From You and How We Use the Information" section above.

##  Links to Third Parties

This Site contains links to other sites. The IEEE is not responsible for the terms or privacy practices of such other sites and you should read their terms and privacy policy carefully before using them.

##  Legal Requests

The IEEE cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties, to enforce laws. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us, service or content providers we work with, or you to possible legal liability.

##  Email Privacy Policy

HTML email communications sent through the IEEE Computer Society's official email service provider, Marketo, use industry-accepted technology to track open and click-through rates. Data received from this practice is used for internal purposes only and is never shared with other organizations.

The technology enables the Computer Society to measure the engagement of recipients so that we can modify content to better serve recipients' interests, as well as to resolve email delivery issues and help manage subscribers' email preferences.

Those who object to the use of such tracking technology in HTML emails can avoid it by either clicking on Manage Preferences in the footer of the email and then choosing the "prefer to receive text instead of HTML messages" option, or selecting the text messages option at the newsletter signup page.

*Please note that the IEEE Computer Society and IEEE maintain separate email databases.
