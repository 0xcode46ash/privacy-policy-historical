# ComponentSource Privacy Statement

ComponentSource may ask you to register and provide information that identifies you when you buy a product, download an evaluation, enter a competition, or when you want information about your personal account.

We use this information for two purposes:

  * To personalize your Web site so that you can change your own account details, create your own quotes, and receive unlimited access to our Web site.
  * To receive product upgrades, special offers, information on new releases and product selection assistance.



If you choose not to register, you can still use most of our site. However, you will not be able to access areas that require registration. Additionally, if you do not wish to receive emails from ComponentSource or from our Component Technology Partners you may select the appropriate options on our registration page.

To ensure that your personal information is correct and current, you may review and update this information at any time by going to the "My Account" section on our Web site, logging on and then go to "Personal Profile". There, you can:

  * View and edit the personal details you have already given us. Tell us whether you want to receive emails from ComponentSource, or would like to share your profile information with third parties.
  * Register. Once you have registered, you don't need to do it again. You just need to logon whenever you enter the site.



We undertake to keep all the information you provide to us confidential and only to use it for the purposes stated above. We will seek your permission first if we wish to use your personal information for any other purpose.

If for some reason you believe that ComponentSource has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by email at [info@componentsource.com](mailto:info@componentsource.com) and we will determine and correct the problem immediately.
