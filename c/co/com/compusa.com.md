At CompUSA, your privacy is very important to us. We appreciate our customers and understand the value of protecting your rights. We hope to address all of your concerns through this list of privacy-related Frequently Asked Questions. 

Does CompUSA collect my IP address?  
Yes. We use this to identify you and your shopping cart, as well as to help us diagnose any problems you may encounter with our server. 

Why does CompUSA need my personal Information?  
We use your name, email address, phone number, mailing address and credit card information to process your orders and/or notify you if you enter and win a contest on our site. Unlike many companies, we keep your information private and do not sell any information about our customers to a third party. 

What is your credit card fraud policy?  
In the unlikely event that you experience unauthorized use of your credit card, promptly report the fraudulent activity to your credit card company. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, you are only liable for the first $50 of the fraudulent charges. Please check with your credit card company to verify specific terms and conditions. 

Will I receive mail from CompUSA?  
We only send information about our hot deals and specials to our customers who find it useful. You can opt-out of receiving future communications from us when you set up your account or by updating your account information. When you participate in a contest or survey, you also have the choice of opting-out at that time. 

How safe is it to shop online?  
Today, the Internet is actually the safest way of doing business with your credit card. We have made it safer to use your credit card on our site than it is to use it in more traditional ways, such as in retail stores or restaurants. 

What is SSL and how does it protect my privacy?  
We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for mutual authentication, data encryption and data integrity- all to ensure secure transactions for our customers. SSL is the industry standard security protocol to encode sensitive information, such as your credit card number. SSL creates a shared digital key which only lets the sender and the receiver of the transmission scramble or unscramble information. To everyone else, even the servers relaying the message, the SSL transmission is indecipherable. SSL encryption can only be broken by intercepting the encrypted message, recording it, and using a computer to try every possible combination until the key is cracked. Most keys range from 40 to 1,024 digits long...as you can imagine, the number of possible combinations can be into the billions and beyond! 

Ok, so how about encryption?  
Encryption is based on the mathematical scrambling and unscrambling of messages. The type of encryption we use assigns two keys - one is a public key and one is a private key. When you send us a message, you use our public key to encrypt your message. Once we receive your encrypted message, we use the private key to decode it. The same key cannot both encrypt and decrypt information. So, information encrypted using the private key can only be decrypted using the public key, and vice versa- ensuring the security of your information. 

I've heard a lot about Secure Sites. What does that mean?  
Before completing any transaction on a website, you should make sure it is a Secure Site. Being on a Secure Site means you are connected under the cloak of SSL security. You can tell if you are on a Secure Site if you see a padlock or key somewhere along the bottom of your browser's window. If the lock is closed or if the key is unbroken, you are dealing with a Secure Site. 

What are cookies and how do they affect my privacy?  
Simply put, a "cookie" is a small file that serves as an identifier stored on your machine. Although they are not required, we use cookies to make web shopping easier for you. For instance, when you are ready to purchase an item, you only need to sign-in as opposed to entering all of your account information again. A cookie can also save your password so you do not need to enter it each time you visit our site from your PC. 

Our site does contain links to other sites. CompUSA is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. If you have any additional questions about our privacy practices, please contact [webmaster@CompUSA.com](https://web.archive.org/contact/contact.asp?type=webmaster)
