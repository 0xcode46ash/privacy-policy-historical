# CommVault: Privacy Policy

### General Policy

CommVault Systems, Inc. ("CommVault") is respectful of your privacy. Generally, you can visit our website without giving us personal information or registering for an account. There are times, however, when CommVault may gather information from you in order to communicate more effectively with you, for example: to provide a publication, communicate about our products, process a job application or provide better service to you.

### Personally Identifiable Information

This Privacy Policy governs how CommVault collects, protects, stores, transfers and uses the personally identifiable information ("PII") that we collect. PII provided to CommVault may include, for example: your name, email address, account password, address, phone number or work experience in a CV or resume supplied to us when applying for a job.

### Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Technologies

CommVault sometimes collects non-identifiable information about the web pages that you visit. Some web pages use "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. CommVault may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to enable us to collect certain information when you visit the CommVault web pages, including, for example: internet protocol address, browser type, operating system, referring site, date and time of visit, URL of pages visited, and downloads from our site.

We may link this information to PII in order to provide better service to you and tailor product and service offerings to you. Most browsers allow you to remove and block cookies and web beacons. If you choose to block cookies and web beacons, you may need to re-enter passwords and user IDs when required. You may also not be able to take advantage of information tailored to your specific needs.

### Use of PII

The PII provided to CommVault is used by CommVault to develop and conduct our business. Some examples of how we use PII include: improving our products and services; personalizing communications with you; conducting market research; conducting customer surveys; engaging in more targeted, customer-specific advertising; processing, fulfilling, and following up on transactions for products, support, and training; tracking and improving the effectiveness of our website and web-based marketing; considering employment applications; and complying with legal requirements and enforcing our website terms of use or otherwise protecting CommVault's legal rights.

CommVault may share your PII with our subsidiaries, service providers and suppliers acting on CommVault's behalf. We may also share your PII to third parties for purposes that you have specifically permitted or when you have posted such information to our blogs, message boards, or other social media environments. Lastly, CommVault may share or disclose your PII in the event that CommVault has a good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary to respond to a judicial action, government inquiry or is otherwise ordered by law.

### Security of PII

CommVault intends to protect your PII and implements appropriate measures and processes to help keep your information secure and maintain its integrity. CommVault uses technical, physical, and other safeguards for such protection against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, and disclosure.

### Children's Privacy

CommVault's web site and marketing are not directed to children under 13 years of age. If that policy changes, we will obtain consent from a child's legal guardian before we collect PII from anyone under the age of 13.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, however, we will not reduce your rights under this policy without your explicit consent. We will post changes to this policy on this page. The effective date of this Privacy Policy will appear at the top of this page for your reference.

If you need to update your information or correct it, you may do so either by logging into your account or sending an email to [privacy@commvault.com](mailto:privacy@commvault.com). We will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes as soon as possible. Further, we may contact you to confirm your request or to obtain additional details from you to process your request.
