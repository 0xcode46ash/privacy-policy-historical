### Sharing of Personal Information

Commvault may share your personal information with our subsidiaries, service providers and suppliers acting on Commvault’s behalf. We may also share your personal information to third parties for purposes that you have specifically permitted or when you have posted such information to our blogs, message boards, or other social media environments. Commvault may also share or disclose your personal information in the following situations: if Commvault has a good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary to respond to a judicial action, government inquiry or is otherwise ordered by law or legal process; to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss to us, our employees, or the public generally; to prevent or report suspected illegal activity; to protect anyone’s rights, property, or safety; or enforce any of our terms and conditions; with other business entities should we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity or in connection with a partial or total sale of assets, bankruptcy, or another corporate change. 

### Security of Personal Information

Commvault uses reasonable technical, physical, and other safeguards to help protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, and disclosure of your personal information. While we take reasonable steps to protect your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy, we cannot ensure or warrant our ability to do so because unfortunately no internet transmission is 100% secure and any transmission of your personal information via our website is at your own risk.

If you need to update your information or correct it, you may do so either by logging into your account or sending an email to privacy@Commvault.com. We will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes as soon as possible. Where allowed by law, you may request access to the personal information we hold about you by sending an e-mail to privacy@Commvault.com. We will process that request in line with any local laws and our policies and procedures in place for dealing with such requests. Please note that before we are able to provide you with any information or correct any inaccuracies we may contact you to ask you to verify your identity and to provide other additional details to help us to respond to your request. We will only use this information in order to process your request.
