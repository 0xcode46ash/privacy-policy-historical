  *   *   * CRE Internet Services - Privacy Policy



Thank you for taking the time to learn more about how CRE Internet Services (“CRE”) manages your personal information. 

This Privacy Policy explains CRE’s privacy practices in relation to its Internet web site www.commercialrealestate.com.au (“Site”). In some cases this Site may link or refer you to other web sites or organisations, which have their own privacy policy and practices. 

In this Privacy Policy, when we refer to ‘personal information’, we mean information that can identify you or from which your identity can be reasonably ascertained - for example, your name and contact details. By using this Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

We reserve the right, to modify or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time and this Privacy Policy should be read with the other terms and conditions applicable to the use of this Site (See the Site’s Terms of Use). 

Personal Information 

You can use this Site without telling us who you are. The only personal information we collect about you is that which you choose to tell us. For example, we may need to collect your personal information so that we can provide you with services or to answer or forward your requests or inquiries. It is our intention that this Privacy Policy will protect your personal information from being dealt with in any way that is inconsistent with applicable privacy laws in Australia. 

How Information is used

Personal information that visitors submit to this Site is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted unless we tell you otherwise in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection. Certain information you submit to this Site (for example, through the “List Your Requirement” and/or “List Your Real Estate” features), will be forwarded to the real estate agents in the State/s you nominate and may be stored in archives for approximately 4 months from the date of receipt. You should be aware that providing information to a real estate agent through our site including through the “List Your Requirement” and “List Your Real Estate” features will result in the information being passed to the real estate agent/s and your information may then be held in any way that does not conform with this Privacy Policy.

If CRE receives a request not to send commercial electronic messages to certain email addresses, CRE may indefinitely retain details of those addresses and the request so that it can comply with the request.

Other organisations that you come into contact with through this service 

Whilst we may through this Site direct you or your queries to other organisations (for example to real estate agents), we do this for your convenience only. CRE is not responsible for the privacy practices of those other organisations unless we tell you otherwise. Before disclosing your personal information to those sites or organisations, you should examine their privacy policies. 

Disclosure 

Apart from where you have consented or disclosure is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was submitted, personal information may be disclosed in special situations where we have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with CRE’s rights or property, users of this Site, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Also, we may disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires disclosure.

Security

We strive to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personal information submitted to our Site, and we review and update our security measures in light of current technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. We will nonetheless endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect the personal information you may transmit to us. 

In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us. However, we will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to your personal information.

Use of Cookies

“Cookies” are data that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies, which are industry standard and are used by many web sites, including ours, can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. They may allow us to customise the Site to your needs. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature. But you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you with some features of our on-line services.

Like many web site operators, we also use software to analyse and record visitor numbers and other details such as: 

  * the number of page views (or page impressions) that occur on Site; 
  * the number of visitors to our Site;
  * how long those visitors (on average) spend on our Site when they do visit; and
  * common entry and exit points into our Site. 



This aggregate, non-personal information is used by us to assist in analysing the usage of our web site. 

Access to your personal information

We will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep any information that we hold about you accurate and up to date. If, at any time, you discover that information held about you is incorrect or if you otherwise wish to review or correct that information, please contact us.

Links To other Web Sites

We may provide links from this Site to other web sites (“linked sites”). Unless we tell you otherwise, these linked sites are not under our control, and we do not accept responsibility for the privacy practices of those sites or their operators. Before disclosing your personal information to any other web site, you should examine the terms and conditions of those sites and their privacy practices.

Changes to this Privacy Statement

CRE’s services are constantly evolving. This may affect the types of information we collect and how we use it. If this occurs, we will update our Privacy Policy. We therefore encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy so that you remain informed of any changes to it.
