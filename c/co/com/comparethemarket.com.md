  * ## 3\. How will we use your data?

We will use your data for the following purposes:-

    1. To provide you with a quote. 

We will use the information provided to us by you to search the websites of our partners in order to obtain the best quotes available to you in respect of insurance.

Some insurers will carry out checks with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies in order to provide you with a quote. The insurers do not make these checks purely because you are using our service, and may make them if you request a quote via any other source. A record of the enquiry may be viewed by other companies if you apply for their services. These enquiries may include electoral roll and credit information, but will not affect your credit standing. 

Some insurance providers may also pass data they hold already on you (for example data from existing products or loyalty scheme data) to their insurance underwriters in order to assess and rate your cover and determine your premiums.

    2. To provide you with information about our services. 

It is very important to us that we provide a service that meets the expectations of our customers. In order to assist us in doing this, unless you tell us otherwise, we may use the information you supply to contact you by phone, e-mail, SMS or otherwise to tell you about products and services which may be of interest to you. For example, these services could include the following:

      * Our newsletter; 
      * New product launches; 
      * Reminders about our service in 11 months time; 
      * Future surveys/research. 

When given permission to do so, we may also share personal information about you with our trusted partners. If you prefer to opt out of such direct marketing activity, please click [here](https://quote.comparethemarket.com/PrivateCar/Common/Pages/Unsubscribe.aspx?affinity=CTM&affclie=CM01&Origin=CM02&affclie=CM01) or [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/) using our simple form.
