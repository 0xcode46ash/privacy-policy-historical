**6\. Credit and data checks**

Some of our product and service providers will carry out checks with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies in order to verify your identity, assess your application for a quotation or credit and offer you the best terms.  The checks may be against both public data (such as information from the electoral roll) and private data (such as your credit history) The providers do not make these checks purely because you are using our service, and may make them if you request a quote via any other source.   

A record of the search will appear on your credit report.  Some product providers may also carry out checks against data they already hold on you (or is held by the company whose brand they administer the product for, or members of their group of companies) such as data from existing products, account data or loyalty scheme data.    They may use this data to help them assess and rate your application for a quote and determine your premiums.  They may also pass this data to their insurance underwriters for these purposes where applicable.
