# Privacy | Complex CA

Complex Media, Inc., together with its partners and affiliates, owns, operates, or provides a network of interactive services and applications (together, " _Complex_ ", " _we_ ", " _us_ ", " _our_ "). This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information when you access the services, applications, and other features or functionality (collectively, the " _Service_ ") on any website that we own, operate or provide (" _Site_ ") and/or via an application accessible on a mobile device (an " _Application_ ") that includes an authorized link to this Privacy Policy. We receive Personal Information about you from various sources, including through your use of the Service and from various third party websites and other services. When you use the Service, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Your continued use of the Service after such amendment constitutes your acceptance of the Privacy Policy as amended. Any capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meaning given to them in our Terms of Use.

**What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?**

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information, such as your name, username, password, age, and email address, (" _Personal Information_ ") that we gather when you access the Service. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or we share with our business partners.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any other sites, services and applications, including Facebook, Google+ and Twitter (" _Third Party Services_ ") that you elect to access through the Service, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage. While we attempt to provide access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.

**What Information Do We Collect?**

The Personal Information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our Service. We collect the following types of Personal Information from our users.

  * _Personal Information Collected Automatically:_

We receive and store certain types of data whenever you interact with our Service and in some circumstances some of this data may be considered Personal Information. For example, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. If you access the Service through an Application, we may also collect your location Personal Information if you have selected settings that enable us to collect such data.

Generally, our Service automatically collects usage data, such as the number and frequency of visitors to our Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Service so that we can improve and make the Service appealing to as many users as possible, and improve. As part of this use of data, we may provide aggregate statistis and analysis to our partners about how our users, collectively, use the Site and Application. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience.

  * _Sign-In Information Collected:_

By creating an account or by signing in for the Service using a Third Party Service (as discussed below), you may provide us certain Personal Information, and you may allow others, including us, to identify you. We may use your contact Personal Information to send you communications about our Service. You may unsubscribe from certain of these communications through instructions in the emails we send you, but certain communications, such as important announcements regarding the Service, are not subject to unsubscription as long as you maintain an account with us.

  * _Financial Information:_

We do not currently collect financial Personal Information, such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial Personal Information); that Personal Information is collected and stored by our third party payment processing company (the _"Payment Processor"_ ), and use and storage of that Personal Information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable terms of service and privacy policy.

  * _Third Party Services:_

As mentioned above, we may allow you to link your accounts to Third Party Services, such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter (" _Third Party Accounts_ ") to the Service. If you elect to link to such Third Party Services, we may collect Personal Information related to your use of that Third Party Service, such as access tokens made available by that Third Party Service, and other content or data that is provided to us from that Third Party Service. For example, we may receive additional Personal Information about you through that Third Party Service, such as gender, age, education, occupation, hobbies, interests, relationship status, and zip code. Third Party Services may also have the ability to restrict the Personal Information that is provided to us. Moreover, we don’t actually store your passwords for those Third Party Accounts. Instead, we just use an authentication token to verify your user name.

Any Personal Information that you elect to distribute through any of these Third Party Services by using the Service is instantly provided to such Third Party Services and, after leaving our servers, becomes accessible by such Third Party Services. Therefore, in addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, you should also review the privacy policies and terms of use of the Third Party Services that you access through the Service.

  * _Email Communications:_

We may receive email activity data from your personal email provider. We use this data to understand and enhance our email communications and the Services. If you do not want to receive email from us, you can unsubscribe from specific email communications or all email communications from us by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in any email we send to you. Please note that certain communications, such as important announcements regarding the Service, are not subject to unsubscription as long as you maintain an account with us.

  * _Cookies:_

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our Site are visited and by how many people. Our cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general data collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your email address is.

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.

  * _Third Party Cookies and Web Beacons:_

We and our authorized third party partners may use device identification, cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to deliver more relevant advertising and communications to consumers. This advertising is sometimes called interest-based or online behavioral advertising. Such advertisements are generally targeted and served to particular users (as described in more detail below) and may come from third party companies called "ad networks". Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use outside of the Services.

Interest-based advertisements may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category, may be based on anonymized data inferred from material provided to us by a user (including Personal Information such as gender or age), may be based on usage patterns of particular users on the Services, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. Ad networks may set cookies through our Site that enable them to retarget you on other sites.

If you would like an ad network to not set or use cookies on your computer or mobile device, you can visit the following site <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

This includes exchanging Personal Information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
  * _With Your Consent:_  Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of your Personal Information.



**Is Personal Information About Me Secure?**

We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees and third parties who have agreed to be bound by confidentiality restrictions, such as consultants, may be permitted to access Personal Information, and they may do so only for permitted business purposes. In addition, we use SSL encryption in the transmission of your sensitive Personal Information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your Personal Information.

If you access a Third Party Service via the Service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that Third Party Service. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other websites. When linking to another website, you should read the privacy policy stated on that website.

We want you to feel confident using the Service and endeavor to protect your Personal Information we hold in our records. However, no system can be completely secure. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user Personal Information at any time. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your Personal Information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their Personal Information and should avoid sending Personal Information through insecure e-mail.

**What Personal Information of Mine Can I Access?**

You can change or access your Personal Information directly through the Service or, for Personal Information maintained by Third Party Services, through that Third Party Service, such as Facebook Connect.

**Children's Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Service.

Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Service, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes. Please note that certain communications, such as important announcements regarding the Service, are not subject to unsubscription as long as you maintain an account with us.



**Changes to this Privacy Policy**
