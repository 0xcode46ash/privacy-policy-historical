> 
> **Use of Information Collected from Employers**
> 
> Information collected from employers is not shared with third parties. Employer information is used for contact and billing purposes only. Because of the nature of the ComputerJobs.com Web site, any information that is included on a job listing must be considered public information. ComputerJobs.com provides an anonymous job posting option to exclude contact or company information from public view. IT professionals can only respond to anonymous job postings through an online form which prevents them from knowing the identity of the anonymous job poster.

   **UPDATING OR REMOVING INFORMATION**

ComputerJobs.com gives IT professionals the ability to deactivate their resume by clicking the "Remove your Resume" link on the "My Career" page of My ComputerJobs. This will take the resume out of circulation, but we will hold the candidate's information for the next time they wish to utilize our services. Candidates can log in to activate their account any time they need their resume to be available to employers.

If you have any questions or would like us to remove your resume, email [ usability@ComputerJobs.com](mailto:usability@computerjobs.com) and we will be happy to assist you.
