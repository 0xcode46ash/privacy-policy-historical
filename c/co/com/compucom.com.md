# Our Privacy Policy | CompuCom

CompuCom is committed to protecting your privacy. We have designed our sites so you may visit them without revealing any personal information.

When you choose to provide personal information to us, please know that we take your privacy seriously. The information we collect is gathered to provide a more personalized shopping experience and to support your business needs. You can help us ensure your privacy by not sharing your user name or password with anyone. See below for detailed information about how we protect your personal information. This privacy policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. If you have any concerns or comments, please be sure to let us know.

The intent of our privacy policy is to make you aware of the choices you can make regarding the information you provide to CompuCom and to inform you of our security practices.

### What information do we collect?

We collect information needed for personalizing your experience and tailoring the information displayed to your business needs. We also collect non-personal information regarding how our site is used so we can continually enhance our service and your experience.

The manner in which you access our site determines the amount of personal information that you share. There are different methods to access our site:

  * You may visit our site as a guest. A guest is not required to give any personal information. They are allowed access to view static, non-client specific content.
  * A guest may register and request an account. When registering, you are asked for your name, workplace email address and work phone number. If your company is not an existing client, a CompuCom associate will contact you to discuss your business needs to establish the site details and personalized content requirements.
  * As a client, we can personalize the site for your business needs. No other personal information is required. Only the business information that you choose to share with your account manager so the site can reflect your business' preferences and present a more relevant shopping experience. At times you may receive product promotions, specials, and newsletters. If you prefer not to receive those, you can opt out by selecting the option on your personal profile. For those clients issuing online orders, we require only the personal information that is needed for safely processing your order and for contacting you about your transactions. It is used exclusively for that purpose.



Other information collected is non-personal and is intended to assist CompuCom to focus our efforts in improving the site's usability and the available features.

Types of non-personal information we collect:

  * IP address - We use IP addresses to measure our site traffic and to help provide a relevant shopping experience. Your IP address is not linked to your customer information.
  * Referral site - If you come to our site via a link, the location of the referral is captured. This is used to help us know where our users come from.
  * Browser type - This information is captured to help us optimize our site to match the latest technology used by our customers.
  * Movements through our site - We keep track of pages you visit to help us provide a more personalized and relevant shopping experience.
