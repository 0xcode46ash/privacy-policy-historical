### Online practices, information about cookies, and other use-tracking devices

Comerica respects your privacy! Through our website, we strive to provide valuable information to you about how we may serve you. To facilitate a better online experience, we use cookies and other use-tracking devices.

Cookies are small pieces of information stored directly on your personal computer. Cookies help websites keep track of your preferences and to recognize you as a return visitor. When you return to a website you have visited before, your browser gives the information stored in the cookie back to the website’s server. For example, in addition to other information, www.comerica.com may use a cookie to save your zip code location selection so that we can present product and service information that is available in your area. Additionally, we may use cookies to facilitate online surveys, to track how visitors use our site, or to delivery our products and services to you. We use this information to improve the content, usability and functionality of our website. Recording information in a cookie allows us to simplify and personalize your online experience, as well as delivering our products and services to you.

You may choose to set your browser to reject cookies. However, we do not recommend disabling cookies on our website because you may not be able to log in or use basic features on our website such as Comerica Web Banking®. For more information see the "Help" information for the browser you are using. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR INTERNET BROWSER TO REFUSE COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING OUR SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.

We recommend you complete your online transactions and log off before visiting other sites or turning off your personal computer. We also recommend that you do not visit other sites during your online banking session.

Comerica may use other use-tracking devices, which may change from time-to-time as technology changes, to help diagnose problems and to administer our website. We also may track browser types to help us understand our visitors' needs related to our website design. Comerica may use Web-Beacons and other devices on parts of the website. A Web-Beacon, also known as a "Webbug" or “clear-gif,” is a small, graphic image imbedded on a page of the website, included in a Web-based document or an e-mail message that is designed to permit the monitoring of who is visiting a website. Webbugs are often invisible to you because they may be very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and/or are made to blend in with the background color of the webpage, document, or e-mail message. Webbugs are identified with HTML IMG tags in the webpage. You may use the "view profiles" of the webpage you are viewing on our website to see whether the page is using a Webbug.

With the assistance of a cookie, Webbugs may collect the IP address of your computer, the URL of the page the Webbugs comes from and the time it was viewed, or other personal information. For example, Webbugs may add information to a personal profile of what sites a person is visiting and to determine what banner ads to display based on the profile. Another use of Webbugs is to provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a particular website and to gather statistics about webbrowser usage at different places on the Internet.

Our website may include advertisements for third parties and their products, and those third-party advertisements and websites may include a cookie, Webbugs, or other device of the third party. Comerica does not have control over the cookies, Webbugs, or other devices used by third parties and does not have access to whatever information they may collect.​
