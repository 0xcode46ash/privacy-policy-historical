Frequently Asked Questions about Security, Privacy and Service How Can I protect myself against online credit card fraud?  
MSN eShop requires its merchants to provide secure transaction capabilities when taking transaction information from our customers. We cannot monitor all of their activities all of the time, however, so be safe and always look for an "s" in the beginning of the URL ( **https://** ) whenever you are giving out your credit card information. You can also look for the small padlock in the lower right hand portion of your browser window. Finally, ensure you are on the site you planned to be shopping with when giving out personal information.  


Where can I go for more information about protecting myself online?  
You can visit the [FTC's website on consumer internet safety](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menu-internet.htm).  


What is my liability for online credit card fraud?  
The Fair Credit Billing Act limits, under certain circumstances, your liability to $50 on misuse of your credit card or billing errors. Note that this act only covers credit cards, not debit cards (the Electronic Fund Transfer Act covers those under certain circumstances as well).

As of 06/00, Major credit card companies may waive even this $50 liability for misuse of your credit card as a result of online fraud. For specific details, go to the credit card company's websites: [Visa](http://www.visa.com/), [MasterCard](http://www.mastercard.com/), [American Express](http://www.americanexpress.com/), [Discover Card](http://www.discovercard.com/). In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has created a website with frequently asked questions and recommended procedures for dealing with fraud. [FTC's website](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/credit/fcb.htm).
