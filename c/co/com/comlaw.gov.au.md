# ComLaw - Privacy

This privacy policy applies to personal information that may be collected by or on behalf of the ComLaw team as part of managing ComLaw.

We are serious about protecting your privacy, and we encourage you to take action as appropriate to protect yourself from the [inherent risks of internet use](https://web.archive.org/content/disclaimer#information).

**Personal information**

Personal information is information or an opinion, whether true or not, about a person whose identity is apparent, or reasonably ascertainable, from the information or opinion.

The ComLaw team does not collect personal information if you only browse this website. However, servers used by ComLaw and by third parties acting on our behalf (including [Google Inc.](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/) ) may send you one or more cookies, and may collect a variety of information including your IP address. This is common practice online, and is for the purposes of:

  * enabling you to return to pages you have already visited on our website, and 
  * assisting us to improve search outcomes and the overall quality of our services. 



The ComLaw team may ask for personal information such as your email address if you send us a message or if you ask for customised services such as "notify me when" emails. Usually we will ask you for such information. We may use other sources such as the internet or a phone directory if required, for example, to confirm important information.

**Use and disclosure of personal information**

If you choose to provide your personal information to the ComLaw team, we only use it for the purpose(s) for which you gave it to us and for related, internal management purposes. We do not disclose your personal information to anyone else unless:

  * you consent to or expect disclosure of your personal information 
  * disclosure is necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law or for the protection of public revenue 
  * disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of a person, or 
  * disclosure is required or authorised by law. 



**Your choices**

You can access and ask us to correct personal information that we hold about you. If you have registered to use My ComLaw, you can opt out of further contact from us on a temporary or permanent basis by updating your My ComLaw profile.
