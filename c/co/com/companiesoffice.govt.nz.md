# Privacy | Companies Office

MBIE will only retain personal information as long as it's required for the purposes for which the information may lawfully be used.

#### Public records

Where any information provided (which may include personal information) to or through this site constitutes public records, it will be retained to the extent required by the Public Records Act 2005. MBIE may also be required to disclose information under the Official Information Act 1982 or to a Parliamentary Select Committee or Parliament in response to a parliamentary question.

#### Security

MBIE websites have security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. To maintain the cyber security of MBIE systems and information, MBIE systems are subject to ongoing monitoring (including activity logging), analysis and auditing. We may use information about your use of our websites and other IT systems to prevent unauthorised access or attacks on these systems or to resolve such events. We may use this information even if you're not involved in such activity. MBIE may use services from one or more third-party suppliers to monitor or maintain the cyber security of its systems and information. These third-party suppliers have access to monitoring and logging information as well as information processed on MBIE websites and other IT systems.

#### Call recording

As part of our commitment to providing the best possible service to our customers we record all telephone calls answered in our contact centre. This helps us to identify ways that we can provide you with a better service.

We record calls:

  * for staff training purposes, helping us to improve the quality of our customer service and to ensure the information we provide is consistent and accurate
  * so we can find ways to simplify our service to you, and
  * to ensure we have an accurate record of your call, which may be needed to support any transactions that take place over the phone or if there's a dispute.



We understand your personal information is important to you and we are committed to protecting your privacy. We store the recordings securely for 2 years and destroy them after this period.

Unless we have lawful reason for withholding this information, it will be made available if you call us, ask for the Privacy Officer and request access to a transcript of your call.

  * access that information
  * request corrections to that information.
