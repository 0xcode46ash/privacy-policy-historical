# Conduit-Powered Application – Privacy Policy

This privacy policy governs your use of a software application (“Application”) that was created using the Conduit Platform (<http://www.conduit.com/>) by one of your favorite brands or web publishers (“Publisher”). The Application includes various features and content that are offered and delivered to you by the Publisher, such as: news, messages, games, and more as well as features and content that you may choose to add. 

Conduit is committed to protecting your privacy and safety rights while using the Application. Conduit enforces strict privacy policies and requires the Publishers to protect your rights and maintain the following privacy practices: 

  1. **No Spyware Policy** – the Application does not collect or transmits personally identifiable information and does not monitor your personal use of the Application. 

The Application sends unidentifiable and non-personal statistical data to enable quality assurance and improve support processes. Such non-personal data includes unidentifiable usage of the Application (for example; statistical usage data can be sent if you open or close the Application but not personal information you may share via the Application). You may choose not to send such statistical data at any time from the Options dialog box of the Application. 

  2. **Third Party Features and Content** –the Publisher or you may choose to add features or content to the Application. In the event that such features or content may require the collection of your personally identifiable information (for example: your login credentials to a third party website, information about content you use on the web, etc.) the Publisher or the third parties providing the content must present to you a clear disclosure of the information that will be collected and you should have the opportunity to decide whether or not to share such information or alternatively not use or remove the content.

Please note that Conduit does not collect any personal information from you other than as described in this policy and it requires the Publisher and third parties that may provide you with content to protect your online privacy rights. 

You may choose to add additional content and features to the Application as part of your ongoing usage. Conduit encourages you to read the terms of service and the privacy policy of any such content before you choose to add it to the Application. 

You may also choose to activate additional features that provide you with the ability to update and use your favorite social networks. During such activation you may choose to allow Conduit to collect your information from such social network systems (subject to the privacy policies of such social network services). Such information may be used by Conduit to help you personalize your Application or suggest new features and content that may be relevant to you. Such information will be protected by Conduit in accordance with its strict privacy policies [as can be seen here - <http://www.conduit.com/privacy/WebsitePrivacy.aspx>]
