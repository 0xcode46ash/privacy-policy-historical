# Comeet Privacy Policy

                                           Comeet Privacy Policy
Comeet Technologies Inc. (“Comeet” or “us”, “our”, “we”) provides a solution for the management
of the information and interviewing of candidates for employment (the “Solution”). Comeet respects
your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Comeet uses any data and information is
provided to Comeet through the Solution and while visiting our site located at <app.comeet.co> (the
“Site”). Comeet will not make your information available to third parties without your consent,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect
Any potential employer, recruiter or manpower agency that uses the Solution to collect, use or store
data of potential employees will input Identifying Information of such potential employee in the
Solution. “Identifying Information” means information that can be directly associated with a specific
individual or entity such as but not limited to a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or
information about activities directly linked to an individual, such as the employment or educational
history of a specific individual, any observations that a potential employer may make in respect of a
potential employee, including during an interview, or any hiring decisions made by a potential
employer. In addition, entities that register to use our Solution will be required to provide us with
certain Identifying Information. Comeet may receive the internet addresses of users that make use of
the Solution. Comeet also collects any Identifying Information contained in any message that you
may send to Comeet.
In addition, the Solution may gather information regarding the system and browsing activity of users
that access the Solution or visit the Site, such as the operating system, browser and IP address of
such users or how a user interacted with the Solution.
How we Protect Information
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Identifying Information submitted to
us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the
Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use
commercially acceptable means to protect your Identifying Information, we cannot guarantee its
absolute security.
How we Use Information
Except as expressly set forth herein, we will not share Identifying Information with third parties
without the express permission of the individual identified in such information. We may use
Identifying Information internally – for example, to help diagnose problems with our servers, to make
Comeet more useful, to customize Comeet and personalize its content.
We allow authorized representatives of a party inputting the Identifying Information to access the
Identifying Information which they inputted.
We may use a potential employee’s Identifying Information in order to send such potential employee
notifications with respect to the employment process. In addition, by analyzing all information we
receive, including all information concerning use of the Solution and the browsing habits of end user
of websites that incorporate the Solution, we may compile anonymous statistical information
(“Statistical Information”). Statistical Information helps understand trends and customer needs.
Statistical Information is anonymous and we will not link Statistical Information to any Identifying
Information. We may share such Statistical Information with our partners, without restriction, on
commercial terms that we can determine in our sole discretion.
Cookies


A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to a visitor's browser. The browser provides this piece of
text to the device of the originating visitor when this visitor returns. Comeet uses cookies to help
personalize your Comeet experience. A “persistent” cookie may be used to help save your settings
and customizations across site visits. Also, if you log in to Comeet, such a cookie will be used to
recognize you as a valid user so you will not need to log in each time you use Comeet. Most Web
browsers are initially configured to accept cookies, but you can change this setting so your browser
either refuses all cookies or informs you when a cookie is being sent. Also, you are free to delete any
existing cookies at any time. Please note that some features of Comeet may not function properly
when cookies are disabled or removed.
Use of Comeet by Children
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 14. In
the event you become aware that somebody under the age of 14 has enrolled without parental
permission, please inform us immediately. Potential employer, recruiter or manpower agency may
not provide information with respect to potential employees under the age of 14.
Third Parties
Please be aware that this Privacy Policy only describes the policies of Comeet. Comeet does not
control how entities using the Solution may make use of your information, including any Identifying
Information. Comeet shall have no responsibility or liability for the collection, use or storage of any
data by any other entity, including without limitation any potential or actual employer making use of
the Solution. You should not provide any information to any entity unless you are comfortable with
the privacy policies of such entity.

We may use subcontractors that are located in countries other than your own, and send them
information we receive. For example, we may send your information to any countries outside the

personal and other information which are not as high as in your country of residence or business.
We may transfer our databases containing your Identifying Information if we sell our business or part
of it.
