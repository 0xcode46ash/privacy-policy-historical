Commence.com is owned and operated by Commence Corporation ("Commence"). Commence collects personal and non-personal information on Commence.com. Commence is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. We have created this Privacy Statement in order to describe and explain to users our information collection practice. If you have any questions or concerns in connection with Commence's information collection practice summarized in this Privacy Statement, please send an email, with the subject heading "Privacy Statement Question," to [webmaster@commence.com](mailto:webmaster@commence.com?subject=Privacy%20Statement%20Question).

####  What Information Is Collected? 

To participate in certain activities and to obtain certain services offered on this web site, a user is asked to provide varying amounts of personal information. Some information is mandatory while other information is discretionary. Each activity and service requires or requests different types of information in order for users to participate. Activities or services that require provision of personal information generally seek full name, email address, and phone number. Depending on the activity or service a user desires, we also may request personal information, such as credit card and mailing address. We endeavor to limit our requests for personal information to information we believe is minimally necessary to achieve our stated collection purposes.

The following is a list of principal activities and services on Commence.com involving collection of personal information: 

  * Alliance Program 
  * Downloading of free software or documents 
  * Viewing of product demonstrations 
  * Purchasing Commence products 
  * Participating in web seminars or other events 
  * Career opportunities 
  * Participating in Commence training 
  * Participating in user surveys 



####  How Does Commence Use My Information? 

Personal information is collected and used primarily for such purposes as, for example, facilitating purchases online, processing a user's resume, or considering alliance applications. In particular, a user's shipping and billing addresses are used for fulfilling purchase orders and for billing the user's credit card. The personal information provided in resumes and alliance applications is used to consider the eligibility of candidates. 

In addition to the primary purposes for which personal information is collected, we may use the personal information to contact a user to confirm information related to a purchase order. We may also use a user's e-mail address, phone number or address: 

  * in our internal surveys to obtain feedback on our products, our web site, or on other aspects of our business that impact you as a Commence customer; 
  * to notify a user of new products or services that we think may be of interest; 
  * to send promotional materials; 
  * to provide our free email newsletter. 



If a user prefers not to receive emails or other forms of communication unrelated to Commence orders and requests for services, the user may opt-out from receiving such communication. The opt-out procedure is discussed in detail below. 

We may also use personal information to contact a user in connection with the user's inappropriate use of Commence.com. 

We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise dispose of the personal information collected on Commence.com to third parties. We may, however, disclose your personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with law. 

We use non-personal information such as demographic data to analyze and develop our marketing strategy. We use non-personal information to determine how you found out about us, what your interests are regarding our services, and how to further improve our site and our service towards you. We also may share non-personal information with third parties. 

#### How Can I OPT-Out 

We provide a user with the opportunity to opt-out from receiving updates on new products, newsletters, and other promotional materials. You can select not to be contacted in the future if you wish to not receive any information with respect to Commence and our products by contacting Commence Corporation directly or sending an e-mail, with the subject heading "Privacy Statement Opt-Out," to [ webmaster@commence.com](mailto:webmaster@commence.com?subject=Privacy%20Statement%20Opt-Out). 

####  Does Commence's Privacy Policy Apply To Linked Web Sites? 

Our Privacy Statement applies solely to information collection practice on Commence.com. This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Commence has no control or influence over the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave Commence.com and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that they visit. 

####  Changes To This Privacy Statement 

If we later change our Privacy Statement, we will post those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner by making changes to collected profile.
