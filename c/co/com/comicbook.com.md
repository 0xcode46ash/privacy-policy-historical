To request such review or to give instructions regarding the information we have collected about a child, parents/legal guardians should [contact us](https://web.archive.org/help/au/contact_us.asp).  
We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children, to participate in the interactive activities offered online, and for children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to this or any other web site. Although guest under eighteen years of age may be allowed, with their parent`s permission and supervision, to participate in noted contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes will be sent to such guest`s parents or guardian. Parents should consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers to help supervise their children`s online activities. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information online without parental permission.
