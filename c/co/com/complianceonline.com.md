# Privacy Policy - ComplianceOnline Quality & Compliance Portal

**Introduction**

ComplianceOnline is a service provided by MetricStream Inc. At ComplianceOnline, we are committed to protecting your privacy and to give you a secure online experience. You can travel through most of our site without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide certain content, services, and products that you request, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. Please read the complete ComplianceOnline privacy statement.

**Collecting Personal Information**

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are ordering e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site, or purchasing products or services. Personal information collected by ComplianceOnline often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to fulfill your request or order.

ComplianceOnline may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, ComplianceOnline may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail address, employer, job title and department, telephone and fax numbers, and other personal information.

When ordering products or services, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to proceed with that activity.

When you buy and install the new products, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we keep this registration information on file with any information you've already given us on previous visits to our Web site. This is considered your personal profile.

When you submit personal information to ComplianceOnline through this Site, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which ComplianceOnline maintain offices. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors and partners of ComplianceOnline. Such vendors and partners are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.

**Use of Personal Information**

ComplianceOnline collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. If you subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. Your personal information is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other products and services of ComplianceOnline and selected third parties.

ComplianceOnline will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on ComplianceOnline or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of ComplianceOnline and its family of Web sites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of ComplianceOnline, its Web sites, or the public.

ComplianceOnline may collect information about the use of the Site, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. ComplianceOnline may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.
