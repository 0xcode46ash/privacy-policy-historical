# vnunet.com Privacy Statement

VNU's data collection policy allows you to choose whether to give us your address details and to control how we use that information. We aim to allow you to control your privacy and give you the means to raise any questions or concerns you may have.

This statement discloses the privacy policy for the VNU network of sites which encompasses the following sites: [**http://www.vnunet.com**](http://www.vnunet.com/)

This statement does not extend to sites that are linked to VNU sites but which are not part of the VNU network. 

It is VNU's policy to allow our site users to provide as much or as little information to us as they feel comfortable doing. As a user of the VNU site you: 

(a) control whether you want to submit your personal details 

(b) control what VNU can do with your personal details

Information collected from site users

If you use the VNU site certain information is automatically collected so that delivery can be made of the service. Cookies may be stored on your machine by your browser. You can set your browser to disable cookies, but then you might find some site features will not work. However, if your system administrator doesn't like cookies you may need to turn cookies off.

When you request a page from the site's web server, the server automatically collects some information about your system, including your IP address. VNU collects the minimum information necessary to make the service work - this information is essential to send the pages back across the Internet to the right computer. VNU uses "WebTrends Live" to analyse traffic to the VNU site. WebTrends Live does not create individual profiles for visitors as WebTrends Live only collects aggregate data. For more information about the WebTrends Live privacy policy, please [**click here**](http://www.webstrendslive.com/privacy_policy.htm).

Your VNU user ID automatically identifies your computer, but not you, to our servers when you visit our site. Unless you specifically tell us, VNU will never know who you are, even though we assign your computer a cookie.

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third party advertiser may place or recognise a unique cookie on your browser, but it will not collect any personally identifiable information about you. VNU does not have control over the collection of information for advertising purposes.
