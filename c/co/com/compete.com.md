# Compete - Privacy Policy

  
Compete samples and aggregates Internet traffic through agreements with Internet Service Providers ("ISPs") and/or Browser Companion Service Providers ("BCSP"). A BCSP is a company that provides end users with tools to help use, navigate, and shop while on the Internet or an intranet. These tools can either improve the users web experience or web performance. You may find more information about our services at [http://www.compete.com/about/about_us.jsp](https://web.archive.org/about/about_us.jsp). 

Compete summarizes online usage patterns without associating these patterns to any personally identifiable information (i.e., name, user ID, mailing/email addresses, or phone number). Therefore, Compete's products and services cannot be used to identify, or market to, specific individuals.
