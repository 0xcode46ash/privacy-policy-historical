|  |    
Compete offers clients aggregate data concerning consumer online behavior by licensing URL and demographic data (age, gender, household income, geographical location, etc.) from multiple sources including ISPs and browser companions. Compete, Inc. honors the privacy policies of its licensors and does not license personally identifiable information from its licensors. 

If inadvertently URL information licensed by Compete contains personally identifiable information passed though a query string or otherwise, Compete, Inc. makes no effort to connect this information with any personal information about an individual user. Further, Compete aggregates data on multiple users before supplying data to its clients, thereby ensuring an individual's privacy. 

**Q. Does the Compete, Inc. license personally identifiable information?**

No, Compete, Inc. honors the privacy policies of its licensors and does not license personally identifiable information from its licensors. Inadvertently, the URLs we license sometime contain personal information about the Internet users whose behavior our data providers record. For example, when an Internet user enters information on a Web page, the operator of the website may insert information into its URL for that or the next page. This information often appears after a question mark in the URL, although it can appear in other places. This means that a name, address, email address or similar information which an Internet user enters into a Web page sometime becomes part of the URL that is then transmitted to Compete by its data providers and stored in Compete's databases. This can also occur with words, topics, products, or phrases entered into search engines. Compete has no control over what information third party websites put into their URLs or where they put it. However, Compete makes no use of this data and makes no effort to connect this information with any personal information about an individual user. Further, Compete aggregates data on multiple users before supplying data to its clients, thereby ensuring an individual's privacy.

Compete, Inc. honors the privacy policies of its licensors and does not license personally identifiable information from its licensors. Compete does not analyze personally identifiable information embedded in its licensed data to determine the identity of any Internet user and does not provide such information to its clients, except as required by subpoenas, court orders or other legal requirements.
