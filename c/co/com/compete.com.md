# Compete, Inc. -> Privacy Policy

  


Compete, Inc. ("Compete") is committed to protecting online user privacy. In order to ensure your privacy, information Compete collects is used only in the manner and for the purposes described below.

This "Privacy Policy" discloses the privacy practices governing Compete's knowing collection, use, and disclosure of information. Capitalized terms shall have the meaning designated in Compete's User Agreement unless specifically defined in this Privacy Policy.

  
  
  
Compete samples and aggregates Internet traffic through agreements with Internet Service Providers ("ISPs") and/or Browser Companion Service Providers ("BCSP"). A BCSP is a company that provides end users with tools to help use, navigate, and shop while on the Internet or an intranet. These tools can either improve the users web experience or web performance. You may find more information about our services at [http://www.compete.com/what/overview.jsp](https://web.archive.org/what/overview.jsp). 

Compete summarizes online usage patterns without associating these patterns to any personally identifiable information (i.e., name, user ID, mailing/email addresses, or phone number). Therefore, Compete's products and services cannot be used to identify, or market to, specific individuals. 

  
  
  
  
You are considered a "Visitor" if you access, browse, or otherwise use Compete's web site ("Site"), either manually or via an automated device or program. Once you register at the Site for our products or services you are considered a "User". All Visitors and Users are bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. Visitors and Users consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of Visitor and User information pursuant to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

Compete collects and stores every Users' name, email address, and password and may collect, if a User so desires, the User's phone number ("Personally Identifiable Information"). Compete does not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from Visitors that are not Users. 

Compete may collect and store Visitors' site referral information, browsing patterns, technical information (e.g., the Visitor's browser version, IP address, and operating system), and other Site use information through the use of "Cookies". (For more information regarding Cookies, see below.) Compete may associate information obtained about a User through the use of Cookies to the User's Personally Identifiable Information. 

  
Compete uses Personally Identifiable Information to better understand the use of the Site and to better tailor the Site to Visitor and User preferences, as well as for customer support purposes. Compete also may use the email addresses that Users supply to contact Users, as well as to send Users promotional or other materials. To unsubscribe from our mailing list, please follow the directions set forth within the promotional or other materials you receive from us or email [unsubscribe@compete.com](mailto:unsubscribe@compete.com). To access or correct Personally Identifiable Information submitted, please send an email to [corrections@compete.com](mailto:corrections@compete.com). 

  
Compete may disclose information obtained through the use of Cookies to third parties for Site analysis purposes. Compete does not otherwise disclose Personally Identifiable Information to third parties, except when required to do so by law pursuant to a search warrant, subpoena, or other legal process. 

Compete uses a feature of Internet Web browsers called a Cookie, which is a file that a Visitor's Web browser places on a Visitor's computer's hard drive, to assign an identification code to the computer and to collect information. Cookies also may be employed to save passwords so that Users do not have to re-enter this information each time they visit the Site. 

We do not and cannot use Cookies to retrieve individual Personally Identifiable Information about Visitors from a Visitor's computer unless the Visitor knowingly and willingly provided such information. Cookies do not contain any credit card information. 

  
The Site provides hyperlinks, which are highlighted words or pictures within a hypertext document that, when clicked, take you to another place within the document or to another document altogether, to other web sites not controlled by Compete. These hyperlinked web sites may contain privacy provisions that are different from those provided herein. Compete is not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of information collected through these web sites, and Compete expressly disclaims any and all liability related to such collection, use, or disclosure. 

Compete's Site is not directed towards children 18 years of age or under and Compete does not knowingly collect any information from children 18 years of age or under through the Site. 

This Site has password security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information obtained through the use of Cookies and Personally Identifiable Information under our control. Compete makes no representations or warranties with regard to the sufficiency of these security measures. Compete shall not be responsible for any actual or consequential damages that result from a lapse in compliance with this Privacy Policy as a result of a security breach or technical malfunction. It is important that Users protect their password and not share it with others. 

  
  
  
In the event that another company acquires Compete or its assets, Compete reserves the right to include information obtained through the use of Cookies and Personally Identifiable Information among the assets transferred to the acquiring company. 

  
  
  
This privacy policy was posted in October 2001. Compete reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy periodically. Use of information obtained through the use of Cookies and Personally Identifiable Information that Compete gathers now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. Compete will post any updates or amendments on this page. Any amendments made to this Privacy Policy will be considered effective ten (10) days after the amendments are posted on the Site. ONCE THE REVISED PRIVACY NOTICE HAS BEEN POSTED, COMPETE WILL SEND AN ADMINISTRATIVE EMAIL TO ALL USERS AS A REMINDER TO VISIT THE COMPETE WEBSITE TO REVIEW THESE AMENDMENTS AND UPDATES.
