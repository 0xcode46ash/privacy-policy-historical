We also collect non-personally identifiable information via various tracking utilities, as described below.

We will use this information in a manner consistent with the following examples.

  * For those users who provide an email address and phone number, we may communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, to provide you information about Compete’s products and services and to add you to our newsletter and marketing lists.
  * If you are inquiring about employment with Compete, we may use and disclose your information to services like background-checking vendors in consideration of your application.

  * We may send you service-related announcements.
  * We may also disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
  * Your personally identifiable information may be transferred if Compete is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets. Aside from such situations, Compete will not transfer your personally identifiable information to third parties.



Personally identifiable information which you voluntarily disclose online in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, social media platform or other open forum, may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We may associate your name and website with your comments on our blog, but we are unable to control uses of your personally identifiable information by other users who see your information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the personally identifiable information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for any number of purposes.

**Opt-Out**

If you no longer wish to receive email communications from Compete as described above, you may opt-out by following the directions that are included in each email communication. You may also contact us at [support@compete.com](mailto:support@compete.com) for assistance.

**Links to Other Sites**

If you visit a third party website that is linked to or from this Site, you should read that site’s privacy policy before providing any personally identifiable information. We are not responsible for the practices of such third party websites, and a link to such website is not an endorsement by Compete of such website’s privacy practices, products or services.

**Tracking Utilities**

**Log Files** : As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information is related to the use of this Site and services and includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

**Cookies** : We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information in part through the use of a web technology called a “cookie.” We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site, to tailor your exposure to certain content on our site, and for storing your preferences.

Cookies are small text files that are saved to your computer using your web browser, which allows websites to recognize you and store preferences and other information if you return to the website using the same computer and browser. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file, or click here for more information on cookies.

**Web Beacons** : We, and our third party tracking utility companies, employ a software technology called web beacons to track the online movements of our site users.

We also use Web beacons in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the “Opt-out” section above.

Web Beacons are tiny graphics or snippets of javascript with unique identifiers, similar in function to cookies, and are embedded invisibly on Web pages. Web beacons may set cookies or interact with cookies on user’s computers.

**Security**

We have put in place reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access to the information we collect. However, no security measures are 100% impenetrable and we cannot guarantee against all potential security breaches. Moreover, the transmission of information over the Internet is not inherently secure, and we are not responsible for the transmission of information over networks that we do not control. Your use of our Site demonstrates your assumption of these risks.

**Data Retention**

We will retain the information described above for as long as the information has value to us, or as long as is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, whichever is longer. If you wish to request that we no longer use your personally identifiable information to provide you services or information, please contact us at[support@compete.com](mailto:support@compete.com).

**Data Access**

For those users for whom we have email and other personally identifiable information, you may correct, update or remove your contact information by contacting us at [support@compete.com](mailto:support@compete.com). We will respond to all such requests within 30 days.

**Changes in this Privacy Policy**

If we are going to use your previously collected personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated in our privacy policy at the time of collection, you will be notified via email or via a prominent notice on the Site prior to the change becoming effective. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner and instructions for how to make that choice will be included in the notification.

If we make any non-material changes to our privacy practices that do not affect information already stored in our database or for future collection, we will post a prominent notice on our Site notifying our users that there is a change and pointing them to the revised privacy policy.

**United State of America**

Our servers are maintained in the United States of America. By using the Site, you freely and specifically give us your consent to export your personally identifiable information to the USA and to store and use it in the USA as specified in this privacy policy. You understand that our data is subject to lawful requests by the courts or law enforcement authorities in the United States.
