# Privacy policy | Comic Relief

We operate with openness, honesty, integrity and in compliance with law.  We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. Whenever you provide us with personal information we will treat your information in accordance with the law and this privacy policy. In particular, we will:

  * Collect information fairly
  * Let you know how we will use it
  * Keep information secure



Any changes we make to this privacy policy will be posted on this page, so please check back from time to time.

### Scope of this policy

This policy applies to our websites located at [www.comicrelief.com](https://www.comicrelief.com/), [www.rednosey.com](https://www.rednoseday.com/) and [www.sportrelief.com](https://www.sportrelief.com/) (each a “Site” and together the “Sites”) and our mobile applications for iPhone and Android (each an “App” and together the “Apps”). The Sites and Apps are collectively referred to in this policy as the “Platforms”.

### Information we may collect from you

When you interact with us (examples of which are when you donate, register online, use our App, purchase from us or contact us - which includes applying for job with us or a grant from us), Comic Relief may receive personal information about you, such as your:

  * Name
  * Email address
  * Postal address
  * Telephone number
  * Debit or credit card details
  * Information stored on devices that use the Apps (such as technical information about your device)
  * Location information using technology on devices that use the Apps



When you visit and use our Sites, we may also use cookies, and collect information about your visit that enables us to identify you and provide you with a more personalised service. For more details, please see the ‘Cookies’ and ‘How we use your information’ sections below.

We also aggregate statistics about users of our Platforms to enable us to operate more effectively, but these statistics do not include information which can identify you. 

### How we use your information

We use your information in a number of ways, which include:

  * Sending you information about Comic Relief, our activities (including our fund raising activities), our campaigns, supporters and beneficiaries and for marketing purposes (including via Facebook and other social media channels)
  * Processing a donation that you have made 
  * Processing an order from our online shop
  * Manage and use any contributions you provide to us, whether via the site or otherwise for our campaign purpose or our activities 
  * Dealing with entries into competitions
  * Processing a grant or job application
  * Responding to correspondence you have sent to us
  * Your location information may be used for certain location-enabled parts of the App



If you have provided us with your personal details to participate in our Red Nose Day or Sport Relief campaigns (for example, to set up a Giving Page, or to order from our shop), and you tell us you wish to participate in another campaign (for example, by entering an event for Sport Relief; setting up a fundraising page for Red Nose Day; or a Giving page, for either), we may use the personal details you provided to us on that previous occasion to save you having to give them to us again.  

We will only contact you with marketing information by email if you have given your consent for us to do so. 

We may send you marketing, fundraising and other materials by post on the basis of our legitimate business interests (which means the interests of our organisation in conducting and managing our activities to enable us to provide the best service and experience and which might include contacting you to ensure our marketing is relevant to you so that we may process your information to tailor our marketing to your interests and sending you materials that relate to our activities). 

You may opt out of receiving marketing materials from us at any time. Please see the ‘Unsubscribe’ section below for more information.

If you have consented to receive marketing, we may occasionally contact you to ask if you would be prepared to help us with our market research, for which participation is purely voluntary.

### Disclosure of your information 

We will never sell your personal data and we do not buy personal data about people who support other charities.

We may share your information with third parties in order to provide services to you.  We may also share your personal information with: 

  * any member of our group of companies;

  * business partners, suppliers, and sub-contractors, for the performance of any contract we enter into with them; 
  * analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our site and/or the provision of our services
  * where we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligations, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Comic Relief, our donors, beneficiaries, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction;
  * a prospective seller or buyer of our business or assets in the event we sell or buy any such business or assets, including where Comic Relief or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data will be one of the transferred assets;
  * for employees, payroll agencies, HMRC, pension and insurance companies.

We will also share your data with HMRC if you give us permission that we can claim Gift Aid on your donation  
Please be aware that any personal information you choose to post on the public areas of the site (such as the fundraiser gallery or Giving Pages) can be read, collected, or used by other users and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.
