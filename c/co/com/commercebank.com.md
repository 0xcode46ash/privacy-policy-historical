**WEBSITE CUSTOMER INFORMATION PRIVACY POLICY**  


Your need for confidentiality and privacy is important to Commerce Bank. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting information with the same care we utilize for all Commerce Bank transactions. 

As a general policy, Commerce Bank does not automatically collect customer information from visitors to our web site. Any information that may be collected from consumer-initiated inquiries is used to assist us in returning information 

_Commerce Bank endorses the Privacy Principles adopted by the Bankers roundtable, the American Bankers Association, and the Consumer Bankers Association._

  1. **Recognition of a Customer's Expectation of Privacy** Financial institutions should recognize and respect the privacy expectations of their customers and explain principles of financial privacy to their customers in an appropriate fashion. This could be accomplished, for example, by making available privacy guidelines and/or providing a series of questions and answers about financial privacy to those customers. 
  2. **Use, Collection and Retention of Customer Information** Financial institutions should collect, retain and use information about individual customers only where the institution reasonably believes it would be useful (and allowed by law) to administering that organization's business and to provide products, services and other opportunities to its customers. 
  3. **Maintenance of Accurate Information** Financial institutions should establish procedures so that a customer's financial information is accurate, current and complete in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. Financial institutions should also respond to requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner. 
  4. **Limiting Employee Access to Information** Financial institutions should limit employee access to personally identifiable information to those with a business reason for knowing such information. Financial institutions should educate their employees so that they will understand the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy. Financial institutions should also take appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce employee privacy responsibilities. 
  5. **Protection of Information via Established Security Procedures** Financial institutions should maintain appropriate security standards and procedures regarding unauthorized access to customer information. 
  6. **Restrictions on the Disclosure of Account Information** Financial institutions should not reveal specific information about customer accounts or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use, except for the exchange of information with reputable information reporting agencies to maximize the accuracy and security of such information or in the performance of bona fide corporate due diligence, unless 1) the information is provided to help complete a customer initiated transaction; 2) the customer requests it; 3) the disclosure is required by/or allowed by law (e.g., subpoena, investigation of fraudulent activity, etc.); or 4) the customer has been informed about the possibility of disclosure for marketing or similar purposes through a prior communication and is given the opportunity to decline (i.e., "opt out"). 
  7. **Maintaining Customer Privacy in Business Relationships with Third Parties** If personally identifiable customer information is provided to a third party, the financial institutions should insist that the third party adhere to similar privacy principles that provide for keeping such information confidential. 
  8. **Disclosure of Privacy Principles to Customers** Financial institutions should devise methods of providing a customer with an understanding of their privacy policies. Customers that are concerned about financial privacy will want to know about an institution's treatment of this important issue. Each financial institution should create a method for making available its privacy polices.
