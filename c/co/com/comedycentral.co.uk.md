Comedy Central will use any personal data collected from the Website in accordance with all laws and regulations relating to the protection of personal data including the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Data Protection Act”).

By subscribing to any newsletters, you acknowledge that U.S law providers a lower standard of protection for personal data than the laws of various countries including, but not limited to, the European Union. Other than as detailed above, Comedy Central will only transfer a User's data to another entity if the User has agreed that Comedy Central may make such a transfer or if the transfer is necessary as part of a transfer of all of or a substantial part of the business of Comedy Central.

In addition and with your consent, Comedy Central (and if applicable, our partners or other trusted parties) may use your data for certain marketing, market research, analysis and related purposes. Comedy Central’s on-screen notices will ask for your explicit permission (often by way of a tick box) for such additional purposes.

A User may also at any time e-mail Comedy Central at info@comedycentral.co.uk or write to us at the address below, in order to unsubscribe from any of Comedy Central’s internet services and to request that Comedy Central delete the User's data.
