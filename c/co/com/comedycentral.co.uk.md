The Website contains links to other sites that are completely unrelated to Comedy Central. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these sites nor are we responsible for the content and practices of these websites. 

Please be advised that countries outside the European Union (“EU”) may have a lower standard of protection for personal information than that required by the Data Protection Act. If it is necessary to transfer your data to a company based outside the EU (e.g. for the purpose of completing a contract for fulfilment of a prize), then Comedy Central will make every effort to ensure that your personal data is processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act, as implementing the EU Directive of the Protection of Personal Data (95/46/EC), and any other Act or Acts replacing or modifying such Act for the time being in force, through the implementation of an agreement ensuring adequate protection of personal data. 

Please be advised that your personal data may be transferred to and processed by our affiliates in the US. These affiliates comply with the US – EU Safe Harbor principles, which govern how your personal data is protected once it has been transferred to the US. Please see the ([Safe Harbor Privacy Policy ](http://www.viacom.com/privacypolicy/Documents/VIACOM-610657-v1-Safe_Harbor_Policy.pdf)). for detailed information on these affiliates’ privacy practices. 

Where your personal information is transferred from the EU to an international third party, Comedy Central will ensure that the third party subscribes to the Safe Harbor principles, operates in a country that the EU has deemed to provide adequate privacy protection, is itself subject to the EU Data Privacy Directive or has entered into a written agreement requiring the third party to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as the Safe Harbor principles. 

By entering any competitions, subscribing to any marketing communications (including any newsletters), participating in any Forum on the Website, joining Comedy Central’s online communities from another community within the Social Project Network or submitting any other personal data to Comedy Central by any means, you consent to your personal data being handled in accordance with the Safe Harbor principles.

All of our online communities and your member profiles for those communities are powered, hosted and administered by Social Project Inc (“Social Project”) which is a company based in the United States that operates a website at [http://www.socialproject.com](http://www.socialproject.com/) and a global network of online social communities (“Social Project Network”). 

When you submit your information to join any of our communities you automatically register with both that community and directly with Social Project in the US. The use by us of your registered information shall be in accordance with this Privacy Policy whereas the use by Social Project of your information is governed by the Social Project Privacy Policy and US law.

Please note that the use of your information by the operator of that community (which may be in a different country) will be subject its privacy policy (which you should review) and shall be governed by the local laws of its country and we shall have no responsibility for this. 

Your member profiles within the Social Project Network are public (unless made private) as are postings to any of our communities which can be indexed by third-party search engines and appear in search results on third-party web sites. You should therefore exercise caution when disclosing information in your profile or elsewhere on any of our communities. 

Comedy Central has taken steps to ensure that your data is secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorised access.
