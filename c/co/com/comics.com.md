United Media's Privacy Statement for Comics.comâ„¢   


The United Media site is committed to maintaining the privacy of its visitors. 

### Gathering & Use of Information

United Media does not require personal information from visitors in order to gain access to any part of Comics.com; any requests for personal data are entirely voluntary. 

Any information gathered online will not be used for any other purpose other than to improve our web site's content or for internal marketing analysis. United Media is committed to the privacy of this information and will under no condition release, sell, share or transfer information to third parties. 

### Information Tracking

United Media uses an outside service to track the total number of visitors to each area of Comics.com. Compiled in an aggregate form, this information shows us which areas visitors enjoy most, and allows us to update and improve site content. Personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process. 

### "Cookies"

The United Media site contracts with DoubleClick to sell and manage the advertisements that you see on the site. The advertisements help us bring you the United Media site without charge. DoubleClick uses "cookies" to improve the quality of your visit to the United Media site. 

"Cookies" are a form of software technology used to collect non-personal information about visitors to any particular site. This type of information includes: type of browser used to access the Internet (i.e. Netscape3.0, Internet Explorer 4.0), type of operating system (i.e. Windows 95, Macintosh) and the domain of the visitor's Internet service provider. 

DoubleClick uses cookies to make sure that you do not see the same advertisements repeatedly and when possible, shows advertising that is relevant to you based on what you have seen previously. Cookies are anonymous. DoubleClick does not know the name, e-mail address, phone number, or home address of anybody who visits the United Media site or any other site in the DoubleClick Network. All users receiving an ad from DoubleClick through the United Media site therefore remain entirely anonymous to DoubleClick; DoubleClick does not have any information to sell or rent to other parties. 

DoubleClick makes available both its policies and information practices at [www.doubleclick.net](http://www.doubleclick.net/) and has voluntarily opened its practices and systems for third party auditing.
