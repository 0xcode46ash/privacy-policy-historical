# Website Privacy Policy | Communispace

This Privacy Policy discloses the practices of Communispace Corporation concerning information we obtain by and through your use of the Communispace website (the "Site") and/or online market research communities hosted and conducted by Communispace (a "Community"). Communispace is committed to respecting your privacy and recognizing your need for appropriate protection and management of any personal information you share with us. The purpose of this privacy policy is to explain the types of information Communispace obtains about visitors to our Site and members of Communispace's online Communities, how the information is obtained, how it is used, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to review and correct, the information. By using the Site or participating in a Community, you are accepting and consenting to the use of your information as described in this policy.

## What Information We Collect and How We Use it

The information we collect on our Site and through Communities generally fall into the following two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. The Personally Identifiable Information we may collect when you use our Site or become a member of a Community may include, for example, your name and e-mail address. Non-Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. If we do combine Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Personally Identifiable Information, the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.

In general, any information you provide may be used in the following ways:

a) to determine whether you meet the criteria for online market research projects conducted by Communispace (a "Community");

b) to communicate with you regarding Communispace's services and/or your participation in a Community;

c) for market research conducted on behalf of a Communispace client;

d) to analyze, evaluate and/or improve Communispace's website, services and/or market research tools.

## Information Provided Through Our Website

You may choose to share Personally Identifiable Information, for example your name or email address, by completing a form on this website. When you provide Personally Identifiable Information to us, we may ask if you want to receive future marketing information and communication from us, such as newsletters, email or other information. You can choose not to receive this communication, if you wish. If you have already chosen to receive such communication, you can ask us to stop by clicking the opt-out link on any email communication, or by emailing a request to [helpdesk@communispace.com.](mailto:helpdesk@communispace.com)

Your information may also be used to help us track the way you use our site and our products. We may also combine the information you provide with information that we collect separately, including information you have provided to other organizations (with consent that it can be shared) as well as public information. All of this information will help us to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services. In order to do this, we may also share your information with companies who carry out work for us. These companies have agreed to only use your information in the way we tell them and to have procedures in place to protect that information. We do not share the information you provide with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure.

## Use of Cookies

## Information Provided Through Communities

Your selection for and/or participation in an online Community may require you to submit Personally Identifiable Information to Communispace. This information will be used for market research purposes and to contact you regarding Community participation and not for direct marketing purposes (however, if you have provided your information to Communispace in other ways, such as through our website, we may use your information to contact you as set forth above).

In some circumstances, the information you provide may include sensitive personal information (ethnicity, income, education, etc.). Communispace collects such sensitive information solely for meeting Communispace's (and its client's) market research goals, specifically, collecting this sensitive information allows Communispace and its client to create a balanced community reflective of a certain consumer population or its segments. Such information is not collected for any discriminatory purposes. You will always retain the right not to answer any question with which you do not feel comfortable.

If you are a Community Member and participate in Community Activities, we may share your information with the Sponsor for whom the market research is conducted. In most cases, your information is shared with Community Sponsors only on an aggregate and anonymous basis. In some cases, however, Communispace may share your Personally Identifiable Information with the Community Sponsor or the Sponsor may have access to that information in the Community. In these circumstances, your personal information may be handled in accordance with the Sponsor's privacy policy, a copy of which will be made available through your Community, but the Sponsor's use of your information will also be consistent with the purposes set forth above.

## Special Circumstances

Other than as set forth above, we may use and/or disclose your information, including your Personally Identifiable Information, in the following circumstances:

  * To enforce, and/or investigate violations of, our site Terms of Use, a Community Member Agreement, and/or this Policy.
  * Although unlikely, your Personally Identifiable Information maybe disclosed to the governments, courts, law enforcement  
or regulatory agencies under a lawful order in a jurisdiction where you are located and/or where your personal information is stored  
and/or processed. You cannot opt out of disclosure of your personal information if required by lawful order.



## How We Protect Your Information

We use reasonable technological and physical safeguards to protect Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

## Storage and Processing of Personal Information

Personally Identifiable Information collected on this website or in a Community may be hosted, stored, processed, or supported in your country of residence or any other country in which Communispace Corporation or its affiliates, subcontractors or agents maintain facilities and by using the site or participating in a Community, you consent to any transfer of information outside your country of residence. If information is transferred outside your country of residence it will be treated in accordance with applicable data protection laws. 

Further, any of your Personally Identifiable Information may be directed to a third party site administered and hosted by a third party vendor retained by Communispace Corporation for processing provided, that in such event, the third party vendor will have no right to use any such information other than uses necessary to fulfill its services to Communispace Corporation.

Communispace Corporation will retain your information for a reasonable period and not longer than allowed by applicable law.

## How to Correct or Remove Personally Identifiable Information

If you do not want your personally identifiable information collected, please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted this information and would like to review, correct, or remove it from our records, please contact your community facilitator or [helpdesk@communispace.com](mailto:helpdesk@communispace.com).

## Safe Harbor Compliance

Communispace has certified its participation, and compliance with, the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor framework regarding the transfer of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland to the United States. The principles of Safe Harbor compliance are notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement. Additional information about the Safe Harbor principles and certification process can be found at [www.export.gov/safeharbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor).

## Links to Third Party Sites and/or Integration with Third Party Services

Our Site and Communities may interface with third party sites and services, (for example, Facebook® or other third party applications or services). Our Site and Communities may also contain links to websites operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control. 

Privacy policies for these third party site sand services may be different from our privacy policy. You access these third party sites and services at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a linked site or integrated service before disclosing any personal information on such site and/or through such service. Communispace is not responsible for information you submit to third parties.

Currently, to help facilitate login to our communities, we may offer in some Communities, at the Sponsor's discretion, a sign-on service that allows you to sign into your Community using login credentials from your Facebook® account. This allows you to associate your existing Facebook® profile with your Communispace account. By linking these accounts, Communispace will have access to certain profile information contained within your Facebook® profile such as your full name, e-mail, locale, gender, profile picture, as well as other publicly available profile information. No Community content will ever be shared on Facebook® without your express permission. You can disassociate your Facebook® account from your Community account at any time by clicking "Unlink" on your Member Profile page. 

## Use of the Communispace Mobile Application

In some Communities, members may have the option to participate in Community activities on their mobile device through Communispace's mobile application. Use of the mobile application is voluntary and optional. Members who choose to use the mobile application must provide their Community login and password to access and complete mobile Community activities. The mobile application may request your permission to collect location data and/or may request access to multimedia stored on your mobile device (i.e. photos or videos). Location data is not required for participation in Community activities; if you do not wish for your location data to be submitted, please respond accordingly when prompted on your mobile device. Multimedia will only be collected from your device if you affirmatively select it for submission through the application (i.e. you chose an image or video to submit for a Community activity). You can change your permissions with respect to location data and multimedia sharing through the settings feature on your mobile device. Any information and content collected through the mobile application will be used consistent with this Policy and the policies and agreements applicable to your Community.

Use of the mobile application may not be available in all Communities, at the Sponsor's discretion.
