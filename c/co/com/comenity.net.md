# Comenity - Privacy

## Privacy statement

Last revised January 19, 2012.

This Privacy Policy (also referred to herein as our "Policy") has been created by Comenity, LLC ("Comenity" sometimes also referred to herein as "we" or "us") to demonstrate our commitment to online data protection and privacy. Our website includes areas in which you may provide personal information, therefore we have developed this Policy to inform you of Comenity’s practices concerning information we collect about you on this site. This Policy is available on our homepage and by clicking the privacy link at the bottom of every page throughout our website. If you have additional questions about this Policy, please contact us at _[webmaster@comenity.net](mailto:webmaster@comenity.com)_. This Policy governs the URL http://www.comenity.net, and describes what information our site collects about you, how it is collected and how it is used. This Policy does not apply to the treatment of personal information collected off-line, or to websites found at other locations, including any web sites operated by entities affiliated with Comenity. For information concerning privacy practices of websites operated by other entities, including entities affiliated with Comenity, please consult the privacy practices posted at those websites. You should read this Policy before using our website, as your use of the website signifies that you agree with all terms of this Policy.  If you disagree with any part of this Policy, please do not use the website.

**Information collected about you**

Comenity’s website collects certain personal information about you whenever you send an email to Comenity or complete our on-line form, such as the ”Contact Us” form. The personal information you provide can identify you and your business, and may include such items as your name, email and US mail addresses, and telephone numbers. 

  
Comenity also collects or logs other information that cannot identify you personally when you visit our web site. This information includes your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address and your domain name. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by the Internet Service Provider ("ISP") computer through which you access the web, and a domain name is the name of the ISP computer itself through which you access the web. 

Comenity logs IP addresses and domain names and aggregates them for system administration purposes and to monitor the use of our site. We use the aggregated information to measure the number of visits to our site, the average time spent on our site, the number of pages viewed, to monitor various other site statistics and to diagnose problems with our server. This monitoring process helps us continuously improve the content we provide. Comenity does not share these statistics with outside parties and does not link IP addresses or domain names with any personally identifying information, which means that a visitor's session will be logged on our servers, but the visitor will remain anonymous. 

We also may retain information concerning the websites that users access by means of links at our site, and the web sites from which users link to our site. This information does not include personally identifiable data concerning those users.

Cookies also can be used for other purposes, such as to store user IDs and passwords so that visitors do not have to reenter that information each time they visit a site. These and other cookie functions may be enabled by our website as appropriate. 

Cookies are read only by the server that placed them and cannot execute any code or virus. With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. Please be aware, however, that some features of our website may be unavailable to you if cookies are erased or blocked.

Comenity also may provide personal information to a purchaser or successor entity in connection with the sale of Comenity, a subsidiary or line of business associated with Comenity, or substantially all of the assets of Comenity or one of its subsidiaries, affiliates or lines of business. Except as permitted by this Policy or law, Comenity does not disclose personal information provided to us online to third parties.
