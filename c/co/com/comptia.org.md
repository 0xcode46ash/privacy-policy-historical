**How CompTIA Uses Information**  
We use the information you submit or otherwise provide about yourself on our Web site for the purpose of completing your request or order. We also use such information to provide you, or have our business partners provide you, with updates and other information that we think may be of interest to you. By submitting or otherwise providing information on our Web site, you are authorizing CompTIA and its affiliates and business partners to collect, save, transmit, transfer, use, deliver and otherwise process such information for marketing, administration, statistical analysis, research, promotions and other purposes deemed necessary or appropriate by CompTIA, including, without limitation, transmitting or otherwise transferring such information outside the country or geographic region in which you reside. By submitting or otherwise providing information on our Web site, you are authorizing CompTIA and its affiliates to send you, and to have our business partners send you, news, announcements and other promotional communications via facsimile, e-mail and telephone. 

Except as noted in this Privacy Statement, we do not share the information you submit or otherwise provide about yourself on our Web site with third parties unless it is necessary to complete your request or order, it is necessary to provide a product or service to you, or we want to provide you, or have our business partners provide you, with updates and other information that we think may be of interest to you. We will also share such information with third parties if it is necessary to protect our rights or property or if it is required by law. We may not control the use or disclosure of such information by any third parties.

We use return e-mail addresses to respond to e-mail inquiries and to confirm orders or registrations. Except as noted in this Privacy Statement, such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with third parties. We never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

Finally, we use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our Web site, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals, except as noted in this Privacy Statement.

**Registrations for Events, Seminars and Conferences**  
To the extent that you submit or otherwise provide information on our Web site for the purpose of registering for any event, seminar or conference, such information (other than any credit/debit card information) may be shared with other attendees, sponsors and/or exhibitors at such event, seminar or conference for networking and other promotional purposes. Such information may be used or publicly disclosed by such attendees, sponsors and exhibitors in their discretion. We do not control the use or disclosure of such information by such attendees, sponsors and exhibitors.

Like most Web sites , CompTIA uses “cookies” for several legitimate purposes. These include remembering IDs and passwords, tracking user traffic patterns, and differentiating between repeat and new users.
