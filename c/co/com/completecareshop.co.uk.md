### Use of cookies by Complete Care

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide us statistical information.

Cookies are used to a minimal extent on this website and never collect your personal details. A session cookie is used to keep track of the contents of your shopping cart - it does not store any of your personal information like your name or address. Cookies are used by Google through Google Analytics (which provides us with general anonymous statistical information on how people browse our website), YouTube where we show videos (again no personal data is collected) and our search engine which is powered by Google. When you make a payment, your order details are passed to Paypal which is one of the safest payment processors in the world. Paypal uses cookies to help you through the payment process. You can [view Paypal's Privacy Policy here](https://cms.paypal.com/uk/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=ua/Privacy_full&locale.x=en_GB).

### Search engine

The search engine on our website is designed to be as powerful and easy to use as the popular search engine Google. The search is made possible by a piece of hardware (a search ‘appliance’) supplied by Google that is plugged into our server and continuously indexes the content on our site. All search requests are handled by the appliance and the information is not passed on to any third party, including Google.
