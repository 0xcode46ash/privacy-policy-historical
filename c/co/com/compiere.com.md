## What information do we collect and why? 

### IP Addresses:

We may use your IP address (not your e-mail address) to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, or to gather broad demographic information. 

### Cookies: 

A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information, such as a user ID, that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. 

We may use cookies to enhance the user experience and deliver personalized content. Cookies help us to deliver information specific to your interests, to eliminate the need to re-enter your password each time you visit our site, or to keep track of your purchases. Some parts of this site also may use cookies to track user traffic patterns for the purpose of determining the usefulness of information supplied to visitors, as well as see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. Consona does not correlate this information with data about individual users, nor does it share this information or sell it to any third party. Advertising networks that serve ads onto our web site may use their own cookies. 

To enhance your experience and minimize errors in our system, we may monitor your activity on our website. 

## Online Surveys and Forms

From time to time, we may conduct online surveys. Our surveys may ask you for your feedback or for demographic information, such as your zip code or your industry sector. If the online survey collects Personal Data, we may use that data to send you further information.
