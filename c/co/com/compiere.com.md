## Our Commitment To Privacy 

Your privacy is important to us. By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau's BBBOnLine Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the programs' strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified by BBB _OnLineÂ®_. Further information about this program is available at [http://www.bbbonline.org](http://www.bbbonline.org/). You can verify this by clicking [here](http://www.bbbonline.org/cks.asp?id=2030514133831318) or on the seal above.

To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 

## The Information We Collect

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the ComPiere web sites. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are: 

Name, Company, Address, Email address, Phone/Fax number, Credit/Debit Card Information, Products and Services bought and downloaded, Subscriptions to Mailing lists as well as info/support Requests.

We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your information so you don't have to reenter it each time you visit our site. The cookie stores user name on your computer. If you have the use of cookies disabled, you need to enter the information each time. 

##  The Way We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. _Example: If you purchase a product provided by our partners (e.g. consulting, documentation, translation, extensions, etc.) we will provide your information to the partner to complete the transaction._

We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

You can register with our web site if you would like to receive information as well as updates on our new products and services. Information you submit on our web site will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form (<https://www.compiere.com/wstore/info.jsp>). You can also unsubscribe anytime on this page.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our web site and to share with third parties. For example, we may tell a business partner that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our web site, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

## Our Commitment To Data Security 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

Encryption is used whenever sensitive information is transmitted or received online.

## Our Commitment To Children's Privacy: 

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our web site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our web site is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

## How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information 

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging in with your username and password and viewing them (<https://www.compiere.com/wstore/login.jsp>). Please do not share your access information to maintain privacy.
