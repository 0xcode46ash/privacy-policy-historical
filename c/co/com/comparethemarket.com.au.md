     COMPARE THE MARKET AND COMPARE THE MEERKAT PRIVACY
                                                    POLICY
This Policy contains important information about how we manage personal information. It applies to all
of the services offered by Compare the Market Pty Ltd ACN 117 323 (CTM, we, us, our) in respect of
www.comparethemarket.com.au and www.comparethemeerkat.com.au (websites) and the Compare

We may modify this Policy at any time, and if we do, we’ll publish it on the websites. We are bound by
the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Privacy Principles contained within that act.
PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Personal Information
The type of information we collect about you will depend on the circumstances, but will generally
include information which is relevant to the quoting or supply of products or services you’re comparing
or enquiring about. Where practicable, we will always allow you to deal with us anonymously or by
using a pseudonym. We may collect personal information from you to provide you with a comparison
service or to allow a supplier who participates in our comparison service, or a business partner who
assists us in providing our comparison service, to contact you. In some cases, if you do not provide
the information we will not be able to provide our services to you.
The information may include, depending on the service you require, your name, address, date of birth,
gender, insurance history, employment information, marital status, proof of identification information
(e.g. driver’s licence, passport details), bank account details, social security information, medicare
number, details about the risk you want to insure, details regarding your financial circumstances (e.g.
existing home loans and savings) and future requirements and property values and your contact
details. If you win a competition that we (or our agents) run, we may also with your consent use your
name, image (e.g. photograph) and/or voice recordings for the purpose of promoting or marketing the
competition and/or our services.
Sensitive Information
If you wish to compare certain products (such as health insurance or life insurance), we may also,
where necessary, collect sensitive information from you. Sensitive information includes any
information about a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, membership of a political
association, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or
trade association, membership of a trade union, sexual preferences or practices, criminal record or
health information. Currently, we may collect information about your trade or professional or health
fund memberships or health information to provide our service for certain products.
HOW WE COLLECT AND HOLD PERSONAL INFORMATION
We generally only collect your personal information from you directly via the internet, including our
websites and social media, and our call centre. Sometimes, we may collect your personal information
from one of our participating suppliers (e.g. where you purchase a policy from that supplier). We may
also collect information from another person (e.g. the person arranging the policy of insurance for
customers covered under a family or couples policy health policies)), or if you enquire about home
loans , we may also collect personal information you provide to the mortgage broker we refer you to or
from our credit licensee). If we collect information about you from a third party, we will determine
whether we could have lawfully collected that information directly from you and, if not, we will destroy
or de-identify that information (provided it’s lawful to do so).


Any personal information that you provide for a comparison (other than compulsory third party
insurance) or to purchase products or services on the websites or through the call centre is collected
and managed by CTM. Personal information that you provide to purchase products or services on
third party websites which are linked to by us is collected and managed by those third parties.
Information for a compulsory third party insurance comparison is collected and managed by the
relevant State or Territory authority in accordance with their privacy policy. The State and Territory
authorities do not provide your Personal Information to CTM.
If you enquire about home loans, personal information you provide may also be collected by our credit
licensee, Australian Finance Group Limited, and the mortgage broker/s we refer you to assist with
your enquiry. Those parties will collect and manage that information in accordance with their privacy
policies.
CTM collects feedback from users of the websites. We will give you the option to provide that
feedback anonymously however, you can provide your personal information with your feedback if you
choose.
From time to time, we may use data collection devices such as 'cookies' in conjunction with the
websites. We may (or our marketing company may) evaluate any cookie information collected to
measure the effectiveness of its advertising and how visitors use the websites in order to:
•      provide you with a better and more customised service and a more effective website; and
•      collect information on how many visitors the websites receive, how those visitors use the
       websites, where they came from and where they go.
We also use web beacons and cookies provided by our third party ad server on the websites, which
transmit information about how visitors use the websites to our ad servers so that advertising on third
party sites can be better targeted and measured. You can configure your browser so it does not
accept cookies, but this may affect the functionality of the websites. We may also collect and store
information on your personal device using browser web storage and data caches.
We hold personal information in data storage and cloud computing facilities operated by us (or by third
parties for us). We take all reasonable steps to protect the information from unauthorised access,
misuse, interference or disclosure.

       agreed) provide you with updates or information about their products and services and provide
       you with reminders;

       products because of our services;

use, deal with and manage your personal information in accordance with their privacy policies. We will
never sell your personal information to other companies.
We may share your personal information with third parties if we genuinely believe that the sharing of
that personal information is required or authorised under law.

to third parties to assist us) to maintain the integrity of the website where there is suspicious or
excessive use of the websites.

are permitted by law to do so, we may disclose your personal information to these providers or
partners to provide our services to you. Currently, these locations include the United States of
America.
ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
You have the right to access and correct your personal information we hold. In certain situations (e.g.
if required or permitted by law), we are able to deny access to some or all of the personal information
we hold. We will always provide reasons in writing if access is refused. We may charge you a
reasonable fee for access to your personal information, but we will advise you of the fee before we
process your request. We will always respond to requests for access and/or corrections within a
reasonable period and we will give access in the manner requested if it is reasonable and practicable
to do so. Please email or write to our Privacy Officer (see Contact Information) if you wish to access
or correct your personal information.
If you provide us with information about another person, you must have that person’s consent before
you provide the information to us. You must also tell the person we have collected their personal
information; the person is entitled to access the information we hold; and he or she should refer to this
document to understand how we manage their personal information.
KEEPING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE

received your personal information, we’ll take steps to make sure it is protected and secure.
