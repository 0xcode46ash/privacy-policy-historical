User's credit card and account information are stored in encrypted form on computers that are not connected to the Internet. comGateway restricts access to User's personally identifiable information to employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to User The security of User's comGateway account also relies on User's protection of User's comGateway password. User may not share User's comGateway password with anyone. comGateway will never ask User to send User's password or other sensitive information to us in an e-mail, though comGateway may ask User to enter this type of information on the comGateway website, which will always have a URL beginning with https://www.comGateway.com/.

Any e-mail or other communication requesting User's password, asking User to provide sensitive account information via email, or linking to a website with a URL that does not begin with https://www.comGateway.com/ should be treated as unauthorized and suspicious and should be reported to comGateway immediately.

If User closes User's comGateway account, comGateway will mark User's account in our database as "Closed," but will keep User's account information in our database.
