# Privacy Policy | Co-op Electrical

## What is our privacy policy?

It’s a set of rules saying exactly what happens to the information you give us. It explains what information we need, how we use it and how we keep it safe.

We also use it to give you our contact details and explain how you can get more information.

When we say ‘we’ or ‘us’, we mean ‘The Co-operative Group’, but we also share some information with other businesses, societies and organisations. We call them our partners and we’re very careful about how we choose them. Remember when you’re on their websites, you should read their privacy statements too.

## How do we learn new information about you?

We often ask you some questions when you buy something from us or sign up for a service or offer in any of these ways:

  * our website
  * emails
  * letters
  * telephone
  * face-to-face conversations.



We also get extra information from other parts of The Co-operative Group or our Partners.

## What do we do with the information?

We mainly use it to give you the products, services or offers you’ve asked for. But we also use your information for other things, such as:

  * Checking it’s definitely you when you contact us
  * Telling you about new offers or promotions we think you’d like
  * To let you know if we can’t give you a product or service you’ve asked for
  * Credit checks
  * Keeping your Co-operative accounts up to date
  * Making sure you’re using your Co-operative accounts properly
  * Collecting and looking at statistics, sometimes automatically
  * Keeping our records correct and up to date
  * Market research
  * Tracking what you do on our website
  * Checking and improving our customer service
  * Stopping crime and fraud



When we’re doing these things, we’ll sometimes get in touch with you by post, email, telephone or fax.

## Who else do we give your information to?

Sometimes we need to give some information to people who help us deliver products and services. These are mostly sub-contractors or agents, like mailing houses or couriers. We give them only the information they need. We make sure your information’s well protected and that they use it based on this privacy policy.

We also occasionally give information to investigating authorities like the police and customs and excise, if the law says we need to.

## Do we ever transfer your information outside the European Union?

Yes, sometimes. But only when it’s necessary for getting you the products and services you ask us for.

Some non-EU countries have different privacy laws to EU countries. So in these cases, we always make sure we’re keeping your information well protected.

## What are cookies?

When you view a website or an email, it will sometimes put a small text file on your computer, smart phone or tablet. That file then stores information based on the things you do.

We use cookies for several things, such as:

  * remembering your preferences when you visit our sites
  * remembering what’s in your shopping basket when you come back to our site
  * giving you personalised suggestions and offers
  * monitoring who’s doing what on our sites (to help improve them).



**Third party cookies**

We also use some third party cookies, which make it quick and easy for you to link with services like Facebook, Twitter and Youtube. We don’t control these cookies though, so you might want to read what each service says about cookies on their websites.

**Our partners’ cookies**

Some of our partners help to promote the things we sell. When they link you directly to our site, they put a cookie on your computer to show us they’re the ones who sent you our way.

## Security

With over 150 years experience on the high street with a name you can trust we understand the importance of security when entering your credit card details on the internet.

At Co-operative Electrical Shop we use secure server software which encrypts all your personal information which prevents it from being accessed or read by any third party. You can check that you are in a secure area of our site by looking at in the browser at the bottom of the page and you will see a padlock. In addition you will see that the our website address now starts with https://

From time to time a notice may appear on your screen alerting you to the fact that you are moving from a secure server to one which is not secure. Do not be alarmed by this. The secure part is where we take personal or credit card details from you and is covered by our security guarantee.

## Credit/Debit Card Details

Credit/debit card details are encrypted to minimize the possibility of unauthorized access or disclosure.

We only accept orders from Web browsers that permit communication through Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.1) protocol. Valid Web Browsers include: Microsoft Internet Explorer, version 10 and above; Google Chrome above version 28, and Mozilla Firefox version 22 or higher. This TLS protocol ensures that you cannot inadvertently place an order through an unsecured connection. Your complete credit card number is transferred to this secure machine across a proprietary one-way interface. This computer is not accessible by network or modem and the number is not stored anywhere else.

If you would prefer to place an order over the telephone please call us on 0800 28 00 111* or alternately email us on sales@coop.co.uk with your telephone number and a time it is suitable for us to call and we will contact you.
