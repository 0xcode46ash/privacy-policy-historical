Please see below for more details.

Our website, like many others, stores and retrieves information on your browser using 'cookies'. This information is used to make the site work as you expect it to.  It is not personally identifiable to you, but it can be used to give you a more personalised web experience.

Because we respect your right to privacy, you can choose to change your privacy preferences to prevent non-essential cookies being set.

This functionality is provided by the [Optanon Privacy Preference Centre](https://web.archive.org/optanon-old.aspx "Optanon") which is available to licence for any site that wishes to give visitors similar choices.

This site contains a number of forms you can fill in to provide us with information about yourself when requesting services, such as:

We use this information purely for the purpose of providing you with the services you are requesting, or to keep you informed about new developments we think you may be interested in.

You information will be held by the Cookie Collective LLP, which is a partnership between [Governor Technology Ltd](http://www.governor.co.uk/ "Governor Technology") and [Thin Martian Ltd](http://thinmartian.com/ "Thin Martian").  Employees of these companies will only have access to your information if they need it to provide our services.

We will not pass on details to any other party without your express prior consent unless we are required by law to do so.

If we send you an email newsletter to the address supplied by you, it will contain tracking images that enable us to see when you open the email. We will also know if you click on any link contained in the email.

We use this information to help us improve the quality and relevance of our communications.

If you do not download images in our emails, then we are not able to track when you open or read the emails we send. 

You can unsubscribe from any further newsletters at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the email sent.  If you do this we will not send you any more newsletters, however we will keep your details on file in order to do this.

The [Optanon Auditor](https://web.archive.org/cookie-audit.aspx "Cookie Audit") plug-in for Google Chrome gathers data about cookies and submits it to our database.

This data contains information both about the cookies found, and the pages on a particular site they were found on.  It also contains values of cookies, which in some circumstances may contain personally identifiable information - if the cookie is designed to hold such information.  Such information is only ever used to help us identify the purpose of a cookie, where a website owner has requested this service from us.  The data may also be provided to the owner of a website if they request it.

We do not use an personally identifiable information for any other purpose, and nor do we make it available in any other way.

All submissions of data via the Optanon Auditor plug-in are otherwise completely anonymous.  No information is collected about the device the plug-in is installed on, or the person using the device.  No browsing history, other than a record pf pages that set cookies, is complied, and no profile linked to a device can be created from the data.

The names and some attributes of the cookies gathered by the auditor are made publicly available on the [Cookiepedia](http://www.cookiepedia.co.uk/ "Cookiepedia - all about cookies") website.  However there is to our knowledge no personally identifiable information contained within this data.

We are committed to making sure that your information is secure and treated in accordance with this policy. We have put in place suitable procedures to safeguard the information we collect in order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure.

Cookie Collective LLP is a registered data controller under the Data Protection Act 1998.

You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998. A small fee will be payable. If you would like a copy of the information held on you please write to [info@cookielaw.org](mailto:info@cookielaw.org)

If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please write to or email us as soon as possible, at the above address. We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect.

We may from time to time publish links to other websites we believe to be of interest. However we have no control over these sites, which are not governed by this privacy policy.
