## Privacy and Security

  


### Online Ordering is Secure

We value our customers and want to make shopping online as comfortable and as safe as possible. We have taken every precaution to safeguard your financial information. Your credit card numbers are encrypted while in transit using the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Moreover, your credit card numbers are encrypted and stored on our isolated network, protecting them from theft or internal compromise. This system provides safe, reliable e-commerce.

In our effort to be a leader in online security, we have designed data management software systems which automatically store and protect your information. Furthermore, for added safety, if our customer service team suspects anything to be improper with your order and/or your credit card, they will contact you and get voice authorization from you.

  


###  What We Collect:

We ask you for information such as your name, e-mail address, shipping address, billing address and method of payment information that identifies you as an individual.

We store and use this information so we can process your order. If necessary, we might use this information to contact you for help processing the order. We respect your privacy. We may use your information to personalize your shopping experience (such as a personal greeting). Our secure server software encrypts all personal information, ensuring that your information stays private and protected.

When subscribing to our newsletter: our newsletter is an optional service to our customers and the visitors to our site. This newsletter provides product promotions and other special announcements. Your specific email address is required. We will not share your email address with any third-party without your explicit consent. We hope you find our newsletter both enjoyable and through our special offers rewarding as well.

Sending us Personal correspondence: when we receive e-mail, letters, or entries to our contests we may collect and store the information you submit.

Cookies (computer data type "cookies"- not our store): "Cookies" are pieces of data your browser stores on your computer's hard drive. They enable us to determine when you or someone using your computer returns to our site. Cookies make your visit a more personalized experience by identifying special offers or relationships. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you like, you can edit your browser options to block them.

About Children/Teens: like you, Cookie's is concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.

ANYONE UNDER 18 must have their parent's or guardian's permission to order.

If we become aware that a subscriber is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files. Please note: we may nevertheless maintain a record of that person's name and address in a "do not register" file to avoid subsequent registration by a child under the age of 13.

Other Sites' Policies: You might choose to leave our site via links to other sites, including those of advertisers. We are not responsible for the privacy, security or the content policies on those sites.

  


###  Disclosure of Information to Third Parties:

Your personal information is used by us, our suppliers and shippers in order to process and ship your orders. Personal information includes your name, e-mail address, mailing address, method of payment information and other data that identifies you as an individual. If necessary, we might use this information to contact you for help processing the order. We respect your privacy. Our secure server software encrypts all personal information, ensuring that your information stays private and protected.

Aggregate information is general in nature and does not contain any personally identifying information. Aggregate information about traffic patterns, sales, and other site information may be shared with partners, vendors, and other reputable third parties.

We may share information with governmental agencies or other companies assisting us in investigation of fraud or prevention of it. We may do so when: (1) permitted or required by law; or, (2) trying to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorized transactions; or, (3) investigating fraud which has already taken place. The information is not provided to these agencies or companies for marketing purposes. 

We will NOT sell your personal information to third parties!

  


###  Safety and Security

Shopping on CookiesKids.com is safe and secure. We ensure that it's safe by transferring all of your personal information, including your name, address and credit card, over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) line. This ensures that your information is encrypted and cannot be read by others as it travels over the Internet. The secure mode begins when you initiate your order. You will know you're in secure mode when the tiny padlock icon (located at the bottom of your browser) appears as locked. You also can verify you are in secure mode by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https" And after the information reaches us, it is stored on a secure server, resides behind a firewall and cannot be accessed from outside the company. At that point, your information can only be accessed by employees to process your orders. 

Alternate Option. If you are still concerned about using your credit card over the Internet you can just phone our Customer Care Center listed below and one of our trained Customer Care Representatives will be glad to take your order.
