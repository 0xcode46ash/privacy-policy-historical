# Privacy Policy | Cooper

**Updated June 19, 2013**

Cooper knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. When you visiting cooper.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. In the sections below, we explain what we do with any data that we gather, and what you can do to learn more about this.

## What personal information about customers does Cooper gather?

Information you give us: The only information you give us that we store are e-mail addresses for mailings. All other information is not kept electronically by Cooper. Automatic information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use “cookies,” and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses cooper.com. We use this information to help understand some practical things about our web traffic—which pages are visited most often, which browsers are used, the typical length of a visit, and so on.

## What About Cookies?

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer.

## Does Cooper share the information we receive?

Our customer’s privacy is important to us, and we do not sell information to others. We only share customer information with third parties as part of transactions for our training services. There’s more detail about this in the section below.

## What about third-party advertisers and links to other websites?

Like many websites, our site includes links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these third-party websites. We have partnered with Eventbrite to process transactions for our trainings and events. All purchase information, including credit card numbers, is captured directly with Eventbrite, and is not directly handled by Cooper. Please review Eventbrite’s privacy policy if you’d like to learn more about how they use your personal data. Their policy has a specific provision in which they discuss how they may use your personal data for marketing purposes.

## Conditions of use, notices, and revisions

If you choose to visit cooper.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Policy, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the state of California. If you have any concern about privacy at cooper.com, please contact us at webteam@cooper.com with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business may change, and our Privacy Policy will change also. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
