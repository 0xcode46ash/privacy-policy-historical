# Privacy Policy | Cooper

Cooper knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting cooper.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. 

###  What Personal Information About Customers Does Cooper Gather? 

  * Information You Give Us: The only information you give us that we store are e-mail addresses for mailings. All other information is not kept electronically by Cooper. 
  * Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses cooper.com. 



###  What About Cookies? 

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. 
  * The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. 



###  Does Cooper Share the Information It Receives? 

Our customer’s privacy is important to us, and we do not sell information to others. We only share customer information with third parties in conjunction with conducting training services, as needed. 

###  What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites? 

Our site includes links to other Web sites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these third-party Web sites. We have partnered with Brown Paper Tickets to process all purchase transactions for training events. All purchase information, including credit card numbers, is captured directly with Brown Paper Tickets, and is not directly handled by cooper.com. We have carefully reviewed Brown Paper Ticket’s privacy policy, and are confident that your privacy is being protected. A link is provided from the purchase screen that further details Brown Paper Ticket’s policy. 

###  Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions 

If you choose to visit cooper.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Policy, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the state of California. If you have any concern about privacy at cooper.com, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business may change, and our Privacy Policy will change also. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
