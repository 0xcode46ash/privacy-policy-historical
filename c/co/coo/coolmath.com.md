# Cool math - Privacy Policy

**We at Coolmath.com, Inc. want everyone's visit here to be enjoyable and safe. This privacy policy tells you what information we collect from the Coolmath family of sites (Coolmath.com, Coolmath4kids.com, ScienceMonster.com, Coolmath4parents.com, Coolmath4teachers.com), and how we maintain and use such information. If we make any changes to this Policy, they will be posted on this page and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of the Coolmath family of sites following the posting of any change shows your acceptance of the changes.**

**For each visitor to our websites, our server automatically recognizes the visitor's IP address only (that's a special number that your internet service provider uses) - not your name or e-mail address or home address.**

**We collect only the IP address, but not the e-mail address, of visitors to our Web site, and the e-mail addresses of those who choose to communicate with us via e-mail.    We never give your email address to anyone else!**

**Coolmath uses second and third party advertisers for all of the advertising that appears on our sites.   Any information collected is anonymous -- like what country you are from, what U.S. state you are from, etc.  and they make a guess at your demographic.  This information is collected via cookies (not the yummy kind).  It's no big deal since most sites and search engines you visit do this.  Game sites do this, too, so that they can remember how many levels you've completed on a game and stuff.  If you want to opt out of all this, you can either have your browser block cookies or you can opt out here:**

**All of this info is really great for us because we can tell what things on Coolmath you like the most and we can guess at what age groups we are making new stuff for.   It's great for us, too, because it helps our advertisers know what kind of ads would be best to show on Coolmath... and these ads pay for everything and keep Coolmath free for everyone!  (They help buy food for my cats too!)**

* Tell your child that if he or she receives something that he or she is not sure about, to let you know.
