**Postings on Forums:**  
It is important for you to remain aware that when you provide personal information (e.g., last name, address, phone number) in a posting on any forum, that information is available to any other person or user having access and use of that message board, and may be used by someone in a manner unintended by you. For that reason, we discourage you from offering any personally identifying information within a posting to any forum. Usually, if we find any personal information posted on our forums we'll remove the post immediately regardless whether the user's consent or keep the post or delete it.
