Your Security on COOL eh.com   
When you provide us with any personal information - your name, address, email and credit card number - it's done on a secure server. One of today's most advanced security systems - Secure Socket Layers (SSL) - encrypts all information you provide before sending it to our own server. Only when it reaches the COOL eh.com servers, is your information decrypted.

Your Credit Card Guarantee  


  * Most financial institutions or credit card providers either cover all charges resulting from unauthorized use of your credit card or limit your liability to CDN $50. If your bank or credit card provider does hold you liable for fraudulent use of your credit card, COOL eh.com will cover your liability up to a maximum CDN $50, provided the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own and was a result of purchases made at COOL eh.com. 
  * In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures. 



*Note: This policy only applies to the COOL eh.com web sites and not to the web sites of other companies, individuals or organizations to which we provide links.
