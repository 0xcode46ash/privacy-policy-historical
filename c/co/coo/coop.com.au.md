### Cookies

Cookies are small data files that are downloaded from our web servers and stored on your hard drive. A cookie is a string of letters and numbers that uniquely identify the computer you are using and the customer number and access code you may have used to register at the Site. We use cookies to store visitor's preferences, record session information such as items that visitors add to their shopping cart, record past activity at the Site in order to provide better service when visitors return to the Site, customise Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends.

The security of our visitors' information is of great importance to us, and we will take all reasonable precautions to ensure that your details are protected. 

We take great care with the information we hold about you. Our aim is to ensure that any details are securely protected from misuse, loss, and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We will take reasonable care to make sure that we keep your information in an accurate, complete and up to date manner. When that information is no longer needed, it will be permanently destroyed or de-identified. 

Whilst it is true that no system is ever completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented provide appropriate protection.
