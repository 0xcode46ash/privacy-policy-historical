# Privacy Policy | CoolWorks.com

We respect your privacy

In these days of spam and online scams, we at Cool Works® are sensitive to the issues of protecting your privacy and your identity. We try to provide the safest possible environment for you to search and apply for jobs. 

#### PERSONAL INFORMATION 

Cool Works® collects personal information from users on a voluntary basis only. This allows us to give you private and secure areas for job seekers and employers to post and edit content on our site. We do not sell your personal information to anyone for any reason. When you voluntarily distribute or display personal information such as your email address or resume, others may be able to collect and use it. As a result, you may receive unsolicited messages from third parties for which Cool Works® is not responsible. 

Our sites contain links to other Web sites over which we have no control. Cool Works® is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other Web sites to which you choose to link from Cool Works®. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other Web sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information. 

Please remember that if you post any of your personal information in public areas of Cool Works®, such as in online forums or chat rooms, such information may be collected and used by others over whom Cool Works® has no control. We are not responsible for the use made by third parties of information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of Cool Works®.

We use the information we gather, whether personal, demographic, collective or technical, for the purpose of operating and improving Cool Works®, fostering a positive user experience, and delivering the products and services that we offer. We may also use the information we gather to inform you of other products or services available from Cool Works® or to contact you about your opinion regarding potential new products and services that may be offered. We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail or other communications regarding updates at Cool Works®. We have an area where you may submit feedback. Any feedback you submit becomes our property, and we can use such feedback (such as success stories) for marketing purposes or contact you for further information. 

#### ABOUT COOKIES

We use cookies at Cool Works® only for the protection and convenience of our users. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly. If a user's system is idle for more than an hour, however, the cookie will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access to the user's information while they are away from their computer.

#### WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW
