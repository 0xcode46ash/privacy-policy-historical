# YOUR PRIVACY AS A COX BUSINESS CUSTOMER 2009

                                 YOUR PRIVACY AS A
                    COX BUSINESS CUSTOMER 2009
We updated this year’s privacy notice to make it easier to read and to discuss new services. We show any
important changes for you in bold.
In keeping with our commitment to be the most trusted provider of communications and entertainment
services, our basic privacy policy remains:
       We keep only the information needed to provide our services,
       treat it as private, use it only for what we offer you, do not sell
       it to others, work to keep it secure and destroy it when no
       longer needed. We will tell you in advance if there are ever
       any exceptions and give you the right to say no.
We cannot cover here every situation that affects your business’s information, but we have included those
we believe you are most interested in. Our website at http://www.coxbusiness.com includes updated
information for you. You can also learn more about your privacy rights through the Federal Trade
Commission, http://www.ftc.gov, and Federal Communications Commission, http://www.fcc.gov. If you
receive your bills electronically, we will send this notice by email. If you would like a written copy,
contact us at https://www.cox.com/privacyrequest.
                                           Information We Collect
Identifiable Information - In providing our services, we sometimes ask for information about your
business (“your information”). This information may include names, addresses, telephone numbers, social
security numbers, driver’s license numbers, premium services you select, demographics, user IDs,
passwords, PINs, email addresses and communications records. We maintain information concerning
subjects like credit, billing, payment, security deposits, maintenance, repair, equipment and services. We
may also collect information about your video equipment, computer hardware and software, modems,
routers, settings and preferences to aid in customer support.
Our policy is to collect only the information needed to provide the services we offer with the quality you
deserve. We take reasonable steps to keep that information secure and retain it only as long as needed for
business purposes or the law requires. We take reasonable precautions to identify your authorized
representative when we receive an inquiry on your account. We sometimes collect information for special
reasons, such as for research, in surveys or registering at our web sites. If so, we will tell you first how we
will use it, and you may choose not to participate. When we offer new services to you, we will tell you
what information we need and how we may use it.
Cable Television Services – We do not collect customer specific information concerning most video
program viewing, except as needed to bill you, without your prior consent. In providing some cable
television services, such as pay-per-view, interactive, and entertainment-on-demand, we do maintain usage
information for billing, programming and related purposes. We compile aggregate information that does
not identify you for programming, advertising and similar purposes. Some digital video recorder services
collect usage information. If this applies, we will tell you when you receive the DVR.


Internet Services – Like most Internet service providers, we automatically collect Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses (an identifier given to your computer while online), bandwidth used, connection performance,
browsers used, and connection dates and times. We keep these records for about six months. We keep
messages you send or receive only in your Cox High Speed Internet folders. We do not store information
on websites you visit. For more information, see our Online Privacy Policy at http://www.coxbusiness.com.
Telephone Services - In providing telephone services, we receive usage information, including calls made
and received and their duration. We treat this information as private and retain it for up to eighteen months,
except in California and Virginia where we are required to do so for three years. We do not share these
records with others, unless we receive a lawfully issued request. If you change or terminate your service, it
will result in loss of any voice messages stored in your account.
We do not listen to or record your calls to third parties. We do monitor certain calls to Cox employees or
agents for quality purposes. If you object to this, tell us when you call Customer Care. We keep records of
these calls for up to two years and treat the information as private.
                                                 Use and Sharing
Use Policy – We consider your information confidential, and use it only in providing our cable television,
Internet and telephone services for such things as sales, installation, operations, administration, advertising,
marketing, support, network management, maintenance, customer care, communications with you, and
billing and collection. We may also use or share it in dealing with fraud and unauthorized use of our
services.
We use and share aggregate information about usage by groups of customers for a variety of purposes.
Aggregate information does not identify individual customers. Cox may use aggregate and demographic
information in association with yours to better offer our products and services to you.
Sharing Policy – It is our policy not to disclose your information to others outside of Cox our affiliates,
vendors and business partners without your prior consent. You can ask us to note your account with a
special flag as added assurance of this promise. You can also notify us if you prefer not to receive
marketing contacts. Simply write to the address on your bill or contact us online at
https://www.cox.com/privacyrequest.
Outside Parties – We sometimes use affiliates, vendors or partners in providing our services and may
share your information for such purposes. We require these parties to assure at least the level of
confidentiality we maintain and prohibit them from using your information for any other purpose.
Special Exceptions - We reserve the right to disclose your information if we have a good faith belief it is
necessary to: (1) comply with the law; (2) protect our rights or property or those of others; (3) respond to
fraud, abuse or unauthorized reception; (4) enforce our standards and policies posted on
http://www.coxbusiness.com; or (5) act in an emergency to protect your safety or that of another. We may
also transfer your information as a part of a sale or transfer of business operations.
Retention Policy – We retain customer information as long as you are a customer or until no longer needed
for business, tax or legal purposes.
Telephone Services –There are special protections for information we obtain in providing telephone
services to you. That information, when matched to your name, address, or telephone number is known as
“Customer Proprietary Network Information,” or CPNI. Examples of CPNI include who, when and where
you call; how much you spend on local and long distance phone calls; the phone services you receive;
pricing plans; billing information; and your PIN number, password and other security measures. Cox does
not sell your CPNI information, and your CPNI will not be disclosed to third parties outside of Cox and our
affiliates, agents, joint venture partners, and independent contractors, except as otherwise required by law.


Customer Authentication and Notices – If you call to discuss your telephone account, you must provide
your “Cox PIN”, found in the top right portion of your bill. If you request, Customer Care can remove
your PIN number from your bill to enhance your security. At Cox offices, telephone customers must
show a government issued photo ID. If you, or anyone authorized by you, make certain significant changes
to your telephone account, Cox will send you notice to confirm that you made these changes. If you
suspect that someone may have made unauthorized changes to your account, contact Customer Care. If we
discover any unauthorized access to your account, we will send you notice promptly, in keeping with
applicable law.
Use For Marketing to You – By law, we can use your CPNI to offer our communications-related services to
you, unless you request otherwise in the next 30 days. You can also withdraw the right for us to use your
CPNI for these purposes at any time by contacting us at the number listed on your bill, or by email to
privacy@cox.com. Regardless, we do not share your CPNI with independent contractors, vendors or any
joint venture partners for marketing purposes without your prior consent.
Some of our services, such as cellular telephone and Cox Digital Cable, are non-communications related.
When you contact us, we may ask for your consent to use your CPNI in marketing Cox packages
containing these services. This consent applies only for the duration of the call or Internet session. As an
alternative, you can consent by writing to the address listed on your bill or by email to privacy@cox.com.
Restricting our use of your CPNI will not affect your service. If you previously contacted us to approve or
restrict our use of your CPNI, we will continue to honor your request and you do not need to contact us
again.
Listings - Our telephone customers can designate their listings as non-published for print or electronic
directories or for directory assistance services. We do not publish these directories and are not responsible
for their content or accuracy. Because of the complexity of this process and the involvement of others,
errors sometimes occur. Our telephone services are subject to tariff or contractual terms that limit our
liability in the event of such errors.
Cable Television Services – We aggregate information concerning some video service viewing and
provide it to programmers, advertisers and certain other third parties. When you use an interactive service
to participate in or to order a product or service, we will ask for your permission to provide contact
information to the appropriate party.
Internet Services – We do not read any of your online communications, unless you send them to us. We
do automatically scan incoming and outgoing email messages to filter out likely spam, harmful messages,
viruses, spyware and related problems that could harm your equipment, the network or others.
                                               Internet Security
Taking Proper Precautions - Maintaining the security of your computer is an important way to protect
your privacy and to help us protect our network and customers. You must follow our policies posted on
http://www.coxbusiness.com and maintain your antivirus software, firewall, wireless network security and
your operating system to prevent harm and potential theft of data. You should regularly back up your
computer to preserve your files, including messages you want to keep, and change your login password
regularly. Cox may take protective action related to your service or contact you directly from time-to-time
to help with security. Always be sure whom you are dealing with before clicking on an Internet link or
giving sensitive information. We encourage you to visit our website at http://www.coxbusiness.com or the
Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) at http://www.ftc.gov for tips on protecting yourself. When
communications enter the Internet, it is possible for outside parties to access them. Since we cannot control
web sites or services operated by third parties, you should review their terms of service and privacy
policies. If you have e-mail with Cox, please note that changes to or termination of your account will result
in loss of any messages stored for you.


Spam - Cox tries to block incoming and outgoing spam using a variety of methods. You can help by
preventing unauthorized access to your computer. We suggest that you remain up-to-date on ways combat
spam by watching for tips on our website at http://www.coxbusiness.com. You can forward unwanted spam
to spamreport@cox.net to help update our filters. We may use email to send transactional, informational,
or relationship messages related to your service. We will never, however, ask you to send sensitive
information to us by unsecured email. If you prefer, you may opt-out of marketing messages we may send
by notifying us in response to any you may receive.
Cookies and Web Beacons –Third parties that place ads on our websites may use “cookies” to collect
anonymous information about your visit to our website and to manage your preferences while there. A
cookie does not give any other sensitive information about you. It can, however, be read by the website
that placed it to note information about your visit, such as your type of browser, operating system and IP
address. A cookie also helps to recognize you when you log in as a registered user or as a repeat visitor.
You can control the cookies your computer accepts through the settings on your web browser or by deleting
them from your files. Doing so, however, may limit the personalization available to you. Web beacons or
clear GIFs are a type of computer code sometimes placed by advertisers on a webpage. As with cookies,
you can use your browser settings to control web beacons. We use cookies to tailor our site by
remembering you and any options you select. We may share non-sensitive information obtained from
cookies with vendors, advertisers and others.
                                   Law Enforcement and Legal Requests
Information Disclosure - We regularly receive legal requests for customer information from government
and law enforcement personnel. We also receive discovery requests in civil cases. In all such cases, we
cooperate by providing the information required by law. Cox does not volunteer customer information or
give access to customer communications to law enforcement or others, except in the “Special Exceptions”
detailed above or if we have a good faith belief that an emergency involving an immediate danger of death
or serious physical injury requires disclosure. Many criminal subpoenas require that we not disclose or
notify you of the request. Due to this fact and the volume of requests we receive, we do not assume any
duty to notify you of receipt of any legal requests.
Internet Information –Information concerning your Internet access may be subpoenaed by the
government or by others. Files shared over “peer-to-peer” services often include your IP Address, and you
could be identified in this way if we receive a lawful subpoena. Law enforcement can obtain details about
your Internet access and the content of communications through a court order or similar authority.
Telephone Information –Law enforcement must obtain a court order or other similar authority to use a
telephone wiretap or a device to capture dialing information. Voice-over-Internet services are subject to
similar surveillance standards. Law enforcement can also subpoena account and call record information.
Cable Television Programming Selections - Records concerning video programming selections may
generally be obtained only under court order, after notice is given to you and you have the opportunity to
object in court.
                                           Security of Information
We are aware of the many instances of data security breaches and continue to work on new ways to protect
your information. For our most sensitive databases, we use encrypted formats within controlled and secure
environments that have restricted access. Although we work to ensure the integrity and security of our
network and computer systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent unauthorized
access.
                                             Child Pornography


The law requires us to report any evidence concerning child pornography we learn of. We work closely
with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other groups to eliminate child
pornography on the Internet.
                                      Customer Access to Information
You may check the accuracy of information in your account by contacting a Customer Care representative.
You may also examine your information and advise us of any errors you believe we should correct, upon
prior request and at your own cost, during business hours at the Cox office listed on your bill.
                                          Your Enforcement Rights
You can enforce your legal privacy rights concerning our collection, use and sharing of your identifiable
information. Among your remedies is the right to seek damages under 47 U.S.C. 551.
                                    Other Terms and Changes in Policy
Other terms and conditions affect our service offerings, including the online privacy policies for our
websites, service contracts, our Acceptable Use Policy for High Speed Internet service, tariffs and the
Terms of Use for our websites. Changes in our service offerings or the law may cause us to make changes
to this and other policies from time to time. We will post any changes at http://www.coxbusiness.com,
along with the effective date of the changes.
                                    Annual Do-Not-Call Registry Notice
To help reduce unwanted telemarketing calls, the FCC offers telephone subscribers the opportunity to
register their residential telephone numbers, including wireless numbers, in its national Do Not Call
registry. You may register for the list without charge by calling the FTC at 1-888-382-1222 or TYY 1-866-
290-4236 from the telephone number you are registering or online at www.donotcall.gov. The FCC/FTC
rules contain an “established business relationship” exception that permits a company that has such a
relationship with you, like Cox, to call even if your number is registered.
