# Privacy Policy - College Crunch

CollegeCrunch.org’s privacy policy explains how we share, use, and collect users’ personal information. This privacy statement may be updated in the future for the purpose of ensuring it corresponds with CollegeCrunch.org information practice rules and procedures, which have the potential to change.

### Personal Information Collection and Use

As you use CollegeCrunch.org and its services, we may collect personal information from you. This information can include information regarding your demographics, computer, or ways we can [contact](http://www.collegecrunch.org/contact/ "contact") you to provide you with services you may find useful or have requested. Some examples of the information we may collect are your:

  * Browser Type
  * Educational Goals
  * Gender
  * Interests
  * IP Address
  * Phone Number

In providing us with this personal information, you are officially sending us an “inquiry.” This action permits us, our marketing vendors and partners, and our affiliates to contact you. This permission extends to contacting you by telephone for a period of time despite your involvement in a Do Not Call list; said inquiry is a legal exemption to Do Not Call list conditions. We may contact you in, but not limited to, the following ways:

  * In reference to a question, concern, or customer service request you’ve raised
  * To recommend an [online](http://www.collegecrunch.org/degrees/online/ "online") [college](http://www.collegecrunch.org/ "college") or [degree](http://www.collegecrunch.org/degrees/ "degree") that fits the personal information you’ve provided
  * To send you news and marketing information relevant to your educational search

We may also use the personal information we collect to improve our business. For instance, we may use it to analyze and conduct research regarding our business needs, or to improve our website and marketing activities.

### Choice/Opt-Out 

If you do not wish to receive marketing information from us, you may follow the unsubscribe  
instructions included in emails.

### Information Sharing Practices 

CollegeCrunch.org will share information only in the ways depicted in this privacy statement, and will never sell personal information for the benefit of a third party company’s marketing activities. However, there may be times when CollegeCrunch.org does share your personal information with third party companies. One of those times is when we are receiving business activity assistance from a service company, and said company needs that information to complete its duties. Examples of such a situation might be a customer service provider or an email delivery service provider.

Another of those times is when we have your permission to do so and CollegeCrunch.org partakes in an acquisition, merger, or a sale of some or all of its assets. During such business processes, it is often lawfully required to share users’ personal information with third parties, especially when in good faith we deem it necessary to do so for the purpose of protecting ours, yours, or another’s legal or physical welfare, determining if a fraudulent event has taken place, or adhering to a government mandate.
