# PRIVACY POLICY | Marvel Collector Corps

**COLLECTOR CORPS PRIVACY POLICY**

Funko LLC (“Funko”, “we,” or “us”) is committed to providing a fun, entertaining, and safe experience for our customers. This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) applies to and governs each user’s (“you,” “your,” or “user”) access to and use of our website located at www.collectorcorps.com (the “Website”), whether you access the Website through a personal computer, mobile device, or any other means. This Policy also applies to any information collected, stored or used by us by other means—for example, if you email us or provide us information over the phone

Together with our [Terms](https://www.collectorcorps.com/terms-conditions), this Policy is a legally binding agreement between you and Funko.  By accessing or using the Website or by registering for an Account (as defined below), you consent to the Terms and the Policy, including Funko’s collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information (as defined below) as described below.  Please read this Policy carefully.  Funko may modify this Policy from time to time and without advance notice, effective upon posting on the Website.  Your continued access to and use of the Website after the Policy has been modified constitutes your consent to the Policy as modified.

**What is Personal Information?**

For the purposes of this Policy, we define “ **Personal Information** ” as your first initial and last name, your email address, your physical address, your telephone number, any payment card or financial information and any other information that by itself or in connection with other information we collect and store is capable of identifying a natural human person, like you.  We will collect and store any Personal Information you provide to us. For example, to create a user account for the Website (“ **Account** ”) we ask you to provide your name, an email address; when you sign up for Funko’s Collector Corps Newsletter (the “ **Newsletter** ”), we ask you to provide your email address; and when you purchase any Collector Corps subscription (“ **Subscription** ”), we ask you to provide your name, shipping address, and phone number. We collect and store any Personal Information that you choose to provide in accordance with this Policy. Please note: it is your choice to provide us with this information.  
Personal Information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect automatically about the use of the Website.  The Policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate information, and we reserve the right to share such aggregate information with potential partners or other third parties without restriction.

**Information We Collect**

Information You Give Us:  Funko receives and stores any Personal Information you post on or provide through the Website or through any other means, including, without limitation, information you provide to Funko when you register for an Account, sign up for the Newsletter, purchase a Subscription, redeem a Gift Subscription (as defined below), or request information from Funko regarding our products or services.  You can choose not to provide such Personal Information, in which case you will not be able to access or use portions of the Website.  Funko may, but is not obligated to, retain the content of any electronic messages (“ **emails** “) you send or Personal Information you provide by any other means.

Purchases: Please note that, if you purchase a Subscription, a Gift Subscription (as defined below), or any other Funko product or service via the Website, we may ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration date, and authentication codes or related information to complete the purchase. Subscriptions and Gift Subscriptions may be purchased only by persons over the age of 18.  Areas of the Website where visitors can make purchases are run by trusted third party Authorize.net. Authorize.net is a leading payment gateway that accepts credit cards and electronic check payments safely and securely for our customers. Authorize.net protects personal information (at a minimum) to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“ **PCI DSS** ”), which is the bankcard industry’s most stringent security standard. The information you provide to Funko or Authorize.net, such as cardholder name, credit card number, billing address, check routing number, account number, or the like, will be used by Funko in connection with Authorize.net for the purpose of correctly authorizing and processing your purchase. Any information you provide on or through any such purchase areas of the Website is subject to Authorize.net’s privacy policy, available at [www.authorize.net/company/privacy/](http://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/).

Gift Subscriptions: You may purchase a Subscription for a recipient other than yourself (“ **Gift Subscription** ”). Upon purchasing a Gift Subscription, you will be required to submit the recipient’s name and email address, and Funko will email the recipient a gift code which he or she may redeem on the Website. The Gift Subscription recipient’s Personal Information that you submit to Funko will be used only to send the email containing the gift code, and will not be stored or maintained by Funko. For more information about Gift Subscriptions, please [click here](https://www.collectorcorps.com/product-category/gifts).

Automated Collection:  Funko automatically receives and stores certain types of Personal Information when you visit the Website, such as the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the IP address of the computer you are using and the browser and operating system you are using; the date and time you access the Website; the Internet address of the website from which you linked to the Website; and any search terms you used to find the Website.

Cookies:  We may use cookies or similar programs, such as web beacons or web bugs, to automatically collect the information described above, including, but not limited to, tracking your device’s browsing habits on the Website. A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your computer to collect information about your activities on the Website. The cookie transmits this information back to the Website each time your browser requests a page from the Website. We may also use cookies to maintain session information you provide to us, so that when you leave the Website and return, the Website will recognize your device. We will never track your Internet usage outside of the Website. However, you always have a choice with regard to cookies. You can modify your browser preferences to allow you to accept or reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is set. If you choose to reject all cookies, you may be unable to use certain areas of the Website. Please consult your browser instructions for information on how to modify your choices about cookies. Finally, you may delete any existing cookies manually from the hard drive of your device. For more information about cookies, please visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

“Do Not Track”: Section 22575 of the California Business & Professions Code requires website and online service operators to disclose whether they honor web browser “Do Not Track” settings.  Funko supports and honors “Do Not Track” web browser settings.  If you enable Do Not Track settings in the browser you are using, Funko will not collect, store, or use Personal Information about websites you visit using that browser other than [www.collectorcorps.com](http://www.collectorcorps.com/). Other parties, however, may not honor Do Not Track signals.  These parties may collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different web sites when you visit [www.collectorcorps.com](http://www.collectorcorps.com/), for example by using cookies on our Website.  We have no access to or control over other parties’ Personal Information collection practices, even those with which Funko may have an affiliation.  You should carefully review the privacy policy and terms of any website you visit.  For more information about Do Not Track, please visit [www.allaboutdnt.org](http://www.allaboutdnt.org/).

  * In connection with the processing, fulfillment, and shipment of any Subscription(s), Gift Subscription(s), or other Funko products or services you purchase.



**Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties**

Funko does not share the Personal Information provided or obtained through the Website with third parties, except as described below and as otherwise specified in this Policy.  Funko may share Personal Information as follows: ** ** ****

  * With the third party or third parties that perform(s) maintenance and operation of the Website on our behalf.  These parties are bound by a confidentiality agreement prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure and/or use of your Personal Information;
  * With other third parties that perform services or functions on our behalf, including, but not limited to, Authorize.net.  We do not authorize such third parties to use your Personal Information for any other purposes;
  * As Funko believes necessary to comply with laws, statutes, or regulations, and/or to enforce this Policy and the Terms and to protect our rights and the rights of others;
  * As required by a court or government agency or to respond to a claim by you or a third party;
  * As part of a transfer of our assets, for example in the event of a merger, acquisition, corporate change or, in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, involving Funko; and
  * As you may otherwise request or agree.



**Children**

The Website is not directed at children, and Funko does not knowingly collect Personal Information directly from users under the age of 13 or from other web sites or services directed at children.  Consistent with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), Funko will not knowingly request or collect Personal Information from any child under age 13 without requiring parental consent.  Children can browse the Website without any personal information being collected.

If you are a parent or legal guardian and purchase a Subscription or Gift Subscription for or on behalf of your child, naming your child as the Subscription or Gift Subscription recipient, you agree that Funko may collect, store, use and process your child’s Personal Information for the purposes described above and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If Funko learns that a user under 13 years of age has submitted Personal Information through or using the Website without his or her parent or legal guardian’s consent, Funko will take reasonable measures to obtain consent by contacting the child’s parent or legal guardian if possible and shall, if consent cannot be or is not obtained, take reasonable measures to delete such information from its databases and not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required by law). If Funko obtains consent from the parent or guardian of a child under 13, we will only ask for Personal Information that is reasonably necessary for the child to redeem and/or receive his or her Subscription or Gift Subscription. ** ** ****

The parent or legal guardian who has consented to a child providing Personal Information to the Website may later view the child’s Personal Information and correct or remove the information, in whole or in part; instruct Funko to discontinue all use of the child’s Personal Information and/or not to communicate further with the child; or revoke or modify the consent, by contacting Funko at [support@funko.com](mailto:support@funko.com) and including the child’s name and email address and the parent or guardian’s name and email address.

Please visit <http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html> for information from the Federal Trade Commission about protecting children’s privacy online.

**Corrections and Updates**

If you want to view, delete, or modify your Personal Information, you may do so by sending an email to **support@collectorcorps.com**.  You may also choose to opt-out of receiving future Newsletters or any other email communications from Funko by following the unsubscribe instructions included in email communications, or by contacting Funko via email as provided above.

Funko reserves the right to verify the identity of any person making a request to opt-out or to delete or modify Personal Information; provided, however, that we will have no liability of any kind resulting from false or erroneous requests or any change or deletion made by Funko for any reason.  Funko stores Personal Information for only as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes described above, as Funko determines is necessary for business records, and as required under applicable law. ** ** ****

**Third Party Websites** ** ** ****

The Website may contain links to other websites.  Funko does not control, and makes no representations whatsoever regarding, such other websites or the products and services offered by or through websites accessed through links on the Website, even those with which Funko may have an affiliation.  If you decide to access third party websites linked through the Website you do so at your own risk.  You should carefully review the privacy policy and terms of any such website.

**What Steps Do We Take To Protect Your Information Online?**

We take reasonable measures to protect your Personal Information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  All Funko employees with access to the Personal Information you provide to us through the Website or through any other means are bound by a confidentiality agreement prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure and/or use of your Personal Information.

Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.  If we become aware of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.  We may post a notice through the Website if a security breach occurs.  We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to use in these circumstances.  Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.  
Users should also be aware of how they handle and disclose their Personal Information and should avoid sending Personal Information through insecure email.  Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <http://www.business.ftc.gov/privacy-and-security/consumer-privacy> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
