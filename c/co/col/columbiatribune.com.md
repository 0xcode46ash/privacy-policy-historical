# Our Privacy Policy | The Columbia Daily Tribune - Columbia, Missouri

## Our Privacy Policy

The Columbia Daily Tribune is committed to maintaining the online privacy of its users. This privacy policy aims to explain the types of information we collect about our users on the websites of the Columbia Daily Tribune and how we use that information. 

### Information collected on our websites

Certain content areas and features of ColumbiaTribune.com and other Tribune websites are accessible only to registered users, and registration requires that you provide some personal information, including a valid e-mail address. This information is collected to help us understand our audience so we can improve the service we provide. Information about individuals is private and will not be shared with advertisers or other third parties, except in aggregate form. The Tribune will not give up control of your e-mail address to any third party. The Tribune reserves the right and at times might use e-mail addresses collected through the registration process for Tribune marketing activities. Those marketing activities might involve the use of software and hosting services provided by third-party vendors. No third-party vendor will be authorized to use data collected by the Tribune for any purpose outside the scope of service provided to the Tribune. Users have the right to opt out of receiving marketing or any other kind of e-mail from the Tribune, and the Tribune will make it easy for users to exercise that option via a hyperlink in all e-mails sent by the Tribune or any third-party vendor. 

### Site Statistics

The Tribune uses server logs and third party software programs to measure traffic to our website. While these logs and programs do not record user-specific information, they do record IP addresses, pages being requested, the date and time of the requests, referrals from other websites and information about the browser and operating systems of our users. This information is used by the Tribune and shared with advertisers only in aggregate form. 

### Cookies

Some features of the Tribune’s websites will not function correctly if you do not allow cookies. 

Some of our advertisers may serve cookies to your browser as well. The Tribune does not have control over cookies placed by our advertisers. However, you have the ability to control whether or not your browser will accept cookies from certain advertisers or ad servers.
