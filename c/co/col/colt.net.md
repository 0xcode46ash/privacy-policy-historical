We review this Privacy Statement regularly. Occasionally we may need to make changes or additions to this Statement that may affect how we handle your data.   We will indicate on this page when the Privacy Statement has changed so please refer to this link for the latest version.

Your personal information may be processed, both by Colt and its affiliates, for purposes including: (i) administering our relationship with you; (ii) providing any goods, services or information you have requested; (iii) providing you with information about our products and services; and (iv) for auditing usage of the site.

Colt sometimes needs to engage others to provide our services to you and/or fulfil other obligations. Your information will not be disclosed to any third parties except where we have your approval or where this is necessary and in accordance with applicable law.

In providing services to you, we may need to transfer your personal data to Colt affiliates or partners outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).

By submitting your personal information to Colt, you agree that you do not object to any such transfer, processing or storage.

The transmission of data via the internet is not completely secure and, as such, is at your own risk. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, e.g. through encryption, password protection or limiting access to your information, Colt cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to our Websites.
