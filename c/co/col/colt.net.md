### What information will COLT collect?

During our relationship with you we may collect personal information, such as your name, address, telephone, email and other contact details and any other information relating to you which you may provide. This information may be used by COLT, its affiliates and service providers in order to maintain our business relationship and to provide you with the services requested by you. COLT has policies and technical measures in place to safeguard and protect your personal information against unauthorised access, accidental loss, improper use and disclosure.

### How do we use this information? 

Your personal information may be processed, both by COLT and its affiliates, for purposes including: administering our relationship with you; providing any goods, services or information you have requested; providing you with information about our products and services; and for auditing usage of the site. Your information will not be disclosed to any third parties except where such disclosure is necessary for fulfilment of our obligations to you or we are obliged to do so by law. 

COLT may occasionally need to transfer your personal data to COLT affiliates or partners located outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Such data may also be stored outside the EEA and/or processed by members of staff operating outside the EEA for COLT or a partner of COLT. Such individuals may be involved with the provision of support services relating to your engagement with COLT. This does not diminish your rights and COLT will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that any personal information that is transferred outside the EEA will be treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By submitting your personal information to COLT you agree that you do not object to any such transfer, processing or storage.

The transmission of data via the internet is not completely secure and, as such, is at your own risk. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, COLT cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to our website. On receipt of your data, COLT will utilise its governance procedures to try to prevent unauthorised access. 

### Updating or deleting your personal information

When you register online for any of COLT’s products or services, you can view and update your personal information by logging onto the site and following the relevant instructions. To ensure any details we hold about you remain accurate please update your personal information if it changes. If you close your account we may retain some personal information in order to comply with legal obligations or for other proper purposes such as collecting outstanding debts or resolving disputes. 

When you request to be removed from further marketing offers, you will be added to a suppression list to ensure your request is complied with. All personal data is processed in line with the requirements of the UK’s Data Protection Act 1998 and The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003.

### Marketing

The processing of personal data for marketing purposes is carried out in accordance with the requirements of national legislation implementing the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (2002/58/EC). Occasionally we may contact you with information about other COLT products and services which we think may be of interest to you but will only do so when you have given your prior consent to being contacted in this way.

If you no longer wish to receive marketing information, please contact us either by e-mail or at the address listed below. If you have subscribed online to receive marketing information from us and no longer wish to receive this material you may unsubscribe by sending an email and writing UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line.

This small file does not store any personal information but it does identify your computer and any particular areas of interest, enabling us to respond to any preferences you express and to make your future website visits more efficient. Save for the use of cookies, we do not automatically log data or collect data with the exception of information you specifically provide to us. You can set your computer browser to reject cookies but this may preclude your use of certain parts of our website.
