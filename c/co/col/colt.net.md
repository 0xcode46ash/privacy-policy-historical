# Colt - Colt Data Privacy Statement

Colt is committed to protecting the privacy of the visitors to its websites (the “Websites”). In order to provide you with details of our products and services, we may need to collect information about you. This Privacy Statement explains how we use any personal information we might collect when you visit a Website. It also explains our use of cookies.  Third party websites accessed via our Websites are not covered by this Privacy Statement and Colt accepts no responsibility or liability in respect of third party sites.   
We review this Privacy Statement regularly. Occasionally we may need to make changes or additions to this Statement that may affect how we handle your data.   We will indicate on this page when the Privacy Statement has changed so please refer to this link for the latest version. 

This Privacy Statement was last reviewed and updated in April 2011.

### 1\. What information will Colt collect?

During our relationship with you we may collect personal information, such as your name, address, telephone, email and other contact details, and any other information relating to you which you may provide.  


### 2\. How do we use this information?

Your personal information may be processed, both by Colt and its affiliates, for purposes including: (i) administering our relationship with you; (ii) providing any goods, services or information you have requested; (iii) providing you with information about our products and services; and (iv) for auditing usage of the site.

Colt sometimes needs to engage others to provide our services to you and/or fulfil other obligations. Your information will not be disclosed to any third parties except where we have your approval or where this is necessary and in accordance with applicable law. 

In providing services to you, we may need to transfer your personal data to Colt affiliates or partners outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). This does not diminish your rights and Colt will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that any personal information that is transferred outside the EEA will be treated securely, in accordance with this Privacy Statement and with the same level of protection required by data protection law. By submitting your personal information to Colt, you agree that you do not object to any such transfer, processing or storage.

The transmission of data via the internet is not completely secure and, as such, is at your own risk. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, e.g. through encryption, password protection or limiting access to your information, Colt cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to our Websites. 

Colt has policies and technical measures in place to safeguard and protect your personal information against unauthorised access, accidental loss, improper use and disclosure. We will also take all reasonable precautions to ensure that our staff and employees who have access to information about you have received adequate training.

If you close your account we may, for limited periods and in accordance with applicable law, retain some personal information in order to comply with legal obligations or for other proper purposes, such as collecting outstanding debts or resolving disputes. 

When you request to be removed from certain marketing offers, you will, in accordance with applicable data protection laws, be added to the relevant suppression list(s) to ensure your request is complied with. All personal data is processed in line with the requirements of applicable data protection laws, for example in the UK the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003

### 4\. Marketing

The processing of personal data for marketing purposes is carried out in line with national legislation and the EU Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (2002/58/EC as amended by EU Directive 2009/136/EC) Occasionally, we may contact you with information about other Colt products and services which we think may be of interest to you. However, we will only do so when you have given your prior consent to being contacted in this way and/or subject to relevant legal requirements.

If you no longer wish to receive marketing information, please contact us either by e-mail or at the address listed below. If you no longer wish to receive certain specific material, you may unsubscribe by replying with an email and writing UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line. 

### 5\. Monitoring and recording of calls

Your telephone calls to us may be recorded for the purposes of staff training and service quality and subject to applicable law. You will be told about this in a recorded message before your call is put through to a member of staff. Calls that are recorded for these purposes will be kept secure, will not be disclosed outside our group of companies, other than for operational purposes, and will be deleted in accordance with our policies and relevant legal requirements.
