Many sites automatically collect this information, and we use it to help assess demand for our services and to assist in diagnosing problems that may arise with our systems efficiently distributing information. Your IP address is used to help identify you. 

When you join the Collectors Society you provide us with account information. This information is kept secure on our server and can be accessed only by you, and in certain instances, by authorized employees of CCG and its member companies. Outside access is not allowed.

If you do not change your account settings, other members may send you private messages either on the Collectors Society site or our message boards. 

If you participate in our Registry Set program and do not obscure your sets, the collectibles that you enter along with their certification number, grade, and any images or descriptions will be seen by all visitors to our website. You may choose to obscure your sets to prevent visitors and other members from seeing your collectibles.
