#### Choosing to Opt-Out 

If you would prefer to not receive marketing information from us, simply follow the instructions included in the emails to unsubscribe from future correspondence. 

#### Sharing Your Information 

We will not and do not sell personal information to third party companies for their unrelated marketing purposes. The only ways we will share your personal information with third party companies are in the manners that are described in this privacy statement. 

An example of how we may share your information is that we may provide it to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities, such as offering customer service or email service delivery. In submitting your personal information on CollegeDegrees.com, you are making an “inquiry” to us, our affiliated entities, and third party marketing partners/vendors, which grants permission to be contacted via email, mail, and phone — you will be consenting to receive telephone calls for a limited period from our affiliates and partners/vendors, even if the telephone number you submitted appears on a state and/or federal Do Not Call list. This is because your inquiry will serve as an exception to state and/or federal Do Not Call requirements.ÿ

In addition, your personal information may be shared to comply with the law, such as in the case of a subpoena or similar legal process when we believe that the disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, your safety or the safety of others, or investigate fraud. It may also be done to respond to a government request if CollegeDegrees.com becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets to any other third party, with your prior consent to do so.
