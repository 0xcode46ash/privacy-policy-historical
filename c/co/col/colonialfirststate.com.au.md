**Colonial First State Privacy Policy**

Australia's National Privacy Policy defines Personal Information as information or opinion that allows others to identify you. It includes your name, age, gender, contact details, as well as your health and financial information. 

At Colonial First State the privacy of your personal information is important to us. We collect personal information to provide you with the products and services you request as well as information about compatible or related products and services we offer. In some circumstances the law may also require us to collect personal information. 

**How is your personal information dealt with?**  
In the course of doing business we outsource certain tasks to third party suppliers. In these circumstances we may disclose your personal information to third parties including mailing houses, information technology support and email suppliers. From time to time we also seek expert help to improve our systems, products and services. These third parties are bound by confidentiality agreements when handling your personal information. In addition, your personal information will not be shared with third parties, other than of this kind, without your consent. 

Your personal information may also be used by us to administer, monitor and evaluate products and services, gather, aggregate and report statistical information, assist you with any queries and take measures to detect and prevent fraud and other illegal activity. We may also be allowed or obliged to disclose information by law and to report on prudential or risk management matters to regulators and our related bodies. 

If you used a financial adviser who recommended your investment in the funds (as indicated on your application form), then details of your investments may be provided to your current financial adviser. 

**Accuracy of your personal information**  
We aim to ensure that the personal information we retain about you is accurate, complete and up-to-date. You will be taken to agree to the use, collection and disclosure of your personal information when you make an investment in the fund. If you provide us with incomplete or inaccurate information, we may not be able to provide you with the products or services you are seeking.
