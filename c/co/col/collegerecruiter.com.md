# Privacy Policy | CollegeRecruiter.com

Visitors to this and other websites owned or powered by CollegeRecruiter.com, LLC can engage in a variety of activities such as post a resume, apply to a job, request information about continuing your education, request scholarship information, participate in surveys, enter contests, order products and/or services, and more. Job boards such as we operate cannot be well used by their visitors unless those visitors choose to provide information about themselves to us and the third party organizations that use our site to help them offer employment, educational, and other opportunities to our visitors.

You may provide us with personally identifiable information that can directly identify you or indicate where you may be contacted during these activities. The information may include your name, address, age, date of birth, gender, class, email address, telephone number, credit card information, hobbies, interests, and more. Sometimes visitors provide similar information about others. We also collect generic information that does not identify you personally such as the type of browser and in which city you're located.

Except as otherwise provided, we reserve the right to use and disclose any information that you provide via this website (regardless of whether such information is provided by you actively, passively, directly, or indirectly) for any purpose that we, in our sole discretion, deem necessary or proper. That said, it is our practice to limit the collection of information to what is necessary to administer our business and to deliver superior products and services to you, and to use and disclose the information collected in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it is gathered. For example, if you apply to a job or request information about continuing your education, we may send the information you provide to the third party organization (the employer or school) which is of interest to you. Or we may, for example, share your information in order to send to you information about a product, service, or opportunity available either through Adguide Publications, Inc. or a third party organization.
