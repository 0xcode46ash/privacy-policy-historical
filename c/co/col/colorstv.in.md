# Color TV Show – Privacy Policy

Viacom18 Media Private Limited (the **“Company”** ) is totally committed to providing the safest and most secure environment for you to interact with us on our website located at [http://www.colorstv.com](http://www.colorstv.com/). We are dedicated to protect your privacy and handling any personal information we receive from you with care and respect.

We encourage the visitors to the Site ( **“Users”** ) to get as much out of the Site as possible, but wish to ensure that all Users know and protect their private and personal information.

The terms and conditions contained in this policy constitute the privacy policy ( **"Privacy Policy"** ) governing the use of information received by the Company from the Visitors and shall be read as a part of the Terms and Conditions of Use located at URL [http://www.colorstv.com](http://www.colorstv.com/). 

### For protection of your private and personal information we would urge you to follow the below:

### 1\. DO NOT GIVE OUT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO UNKNOWN SOURCES

Never give out personal information to people you don't know. Sometimes you might wish to give out personal information for good reasons. At other times, it might be unnecessary.

If you are a minor, check with your parents or guardians before giving out any information you think might be personal information on any website. There's no harm in checking first if you're not sure! Talk to your Parents about the release of personal information and make sure you understand what are the reasons for giving it out.

### 2\. WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AT THE WEBSITE?

We endeavour to create website content which requires minimum collection of information from our users. Generally, the Site limits collection of information to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g. first name, age, birthday, gender, city or town). This information is collected so visitors can participate in activities without giving out unnecessary personal information. Where we need extra information, e.g. kids'/parents' email addresses, telephone numbers (as explained below) to run competitions or to offer extra on-line activities, we let the visitors know the reason for which we are collecting the information and what we will do with it. We do not as a condition to a visitor’s participation in any of our on-line activity require the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary.

There are some areas of the Site that ask visitors to enter personally identifiable information. We have made this safer and easier for the Users to use by establishing a Name and Password facility. This requires the User to enter in personally identifiable information only once at the time of registration, but after that they only require to put in their Name and Password. This personal information is added to our database and is used for the purpose of fulfilling prizes, mailing/emailing newsletters and birthday cards, emailing our newsletters and for other marketing purposes initiated by the Site. The personal information is not on sold or shared to any third party and is not accessible or displayed anywhere on the Site.

### 1) Registration

The main way we collect personally identifiable information is through our registration process. In order to take part in our registered member activities, we ask Users to submit personal information ( **“Personal Information”** ) such as full name, email address, postcode and birthday and we ask each User if they wish to **opt-in or opt-out to receiving emails** from us as part of our activities for registered members e.g. our newsletter. **In the event User is a child below 18 years of age, we remind them to ask a parent/guardian for permission first.** The information is used to allow Users to take part in registered member activities such as message boards, newsletters, any special member competitions and send postcards. Registered users ( **“Registered Users”** ) can unsubscribe, modify and remove Personal Information from the Site at any time.

All such Personal Information collected during the registration process is used only for the purpose of providing Registered Users with access to our registered member activities. We do not use such Personal Information for general marketing purposes or to share it with third parties (except in relation to competitions as set out below or where we are required to do so by law or in the context of a business transfer) or if so permitted by the Registered user. 

We do not obtain or require disclosure of sensitive Personal Information (such as ethnic origin or religion) but if you choose to provide us with such sensitive personal data, we may assume such sensitive Personal Information is provided with your express consent for processing by us for the purposes for which such Personal Information was provided by you unless otherwise notified by you to us in writing in the feedback form.

### 2) Competitions

We offer the opportunity to all Users to enter competitions on-line which may be open to all Users or certain select groups depending on each competition. In order to run competitions and send out prizes, it is necessary to collect some Personal Information from users. This can include name, address and telephone number. As a matter of policy, we keep such Personal Information only for the purposes of administering the competition and do not disclose such information to third parties except where necessary to fulfil the prizes (e.g. it may be shared with fulfilment houses for processing purposes). We may from time to time offer competitions sponsored by third party businesses and may share entrant’s Personal Information with such businesses in order to fulfil the competition only. We will provide potential entrants with the opportunity to **opt-in or opt-out** to such third party sponsored competitions. Once a competition is finished, we will delete any personal information collected via on-line entry forms from our systems and it is not kept for any longer than is necessary.

### 3) E-cards

E-cards are animated e-postcards that visitors can send to friends and family. We do not collect our visitors' full names, but we do collect email addresses during this process in order to inform the User that their postcard has been read. We also ask users to submit their friends' email addresses so we can send them these e-cards. We think it would be disproportionate to inform user's friend(s) about our privacy policy and how we will be using their Personal Information beforehand because it would spoil the surprise of receiving the friend's electronic postcard. However, we can reassure Users that this data is not transferred to a third party or used for marketing purposes and it is not kept for any longer than is necessary.

### 4) Blogs and Message Blogs

The blogs at the site is intended for Users and we will not knowingly collect Personal Information from adults who pose themselves as kids. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under age 18 who has become a member of our Site, please fill in the feedback form to notify us of a suspected violation.

The nature of blogging is to reach a public audience. Please be aware that any information that you submit to us whether through message boards, picture uploads, blogs, feedback and e-mail, including Personally Information, may be publicly displayed on the Site, or on websites not within our control. If you don't want others to see such information, please do not submit it.

### 5) Feedback

We provide Users to the Site with the opportunity to email us with their opinions and comments. We request for no Personal Information unless the User indicates that he or she wants us to reply. In these circumstances, we ask for a first name and email address. This information is used solely by us in order to give requested feedback and is then deleted from our system periodically.

### 6) Security

We have taken steps to ensure that all Personal Information that we collect is secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers as well as electronic security systems and password protections, which guard against unauthorized access. We also ask the parents to monitor their children's internet usage and become educated to the various software tools.

### 3\. AMENDMENT TO THE PRIVACY POLICY

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your Personal Information, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail at the last e-mail address that you provided us, and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Site. Any material changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon the earlier of one week following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or our posting of notice of the changes on the Site. 

Please note that, at all times, you are responsible for updating your Personal Information to provide us your current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any other reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. In any event, changes to this Privacy Policy may affect our use of Personal Information that you provided us prior to our notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your information, you must notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish to deactivate your account with us.
