# Privacy Policy - CollegeandUniversity.net

CUnet, LLC Privacy Policy

CUnet, LLC and its affiliated companies ("we" or "us") operate a series of websites offering a variety of products and services (a "Site" or the "Sites"). This notice outlines the privacy policies of the Sites. By visiting this website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy. Since any changes will be posted on this page, we encourage you to check this page regularly. Your continued use of the Sites following any changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes. 

**Your IP Address**

Each time you visit the Sites, our web server automatically recognizes your IP address and the Web page from which you came. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the Sites, and to better serve you in using the services and features of the Sites. 

**Cookies and Action Tags**

The first time a user provides an e-mail address in connection with their activities at a Site, we assign an identification number to that e-mail address and deploy a cookie to the user's PC. Whenever that user comes back to a Site using the same PC, the cookie allows the Site to identify the user and to recall the user's e-mail address. If, at any time, a user provides other information in connection with their activities on a Site (such as name, address, birth date, gender, etc.), we may store that information, along with the user's e-mail address, in our user database. We may use the information stored in our database (i) for the purpose for which the information was originally provided by a user, (ii) to pre-populate information fields in the event a user wishes to request information, sign up for and/or subscribe to services, promotions or offers in the future, (iii) to ensure that a user will not be repeatedly exposed to the same ads, offers and promotions while visiting Sites, and (iv) to, in connection with regular communication with a user, include offers, promotions or advertisements historically, or likely to be, of interest to that user.

Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods: An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or actions by visitors who view certain advertisements or other information on a site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. We may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our Sites and to provide information about what products are viewed or purchased. 

**Personal Information We Collect From You**

While on the Site we may collect personal information from you. Personal information may include information you provide to us while registering with a Site, making purchases, or as otherwise requested on the Site, such as your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. Personal information may also include information we gather about you while on a Site such as your information requests & usage history. We may also collect demographic information that you provide to us such as your zip code, age, or income level.

**How We Use Personal Information**

We will use your personal information for customer service, to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience on a Site, and to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into by you on a Site. We may also use your personal information for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our business. We may also combine the information we have gathered about you with information from other sources. We may use third parties to help us operate our business and the Sites or administer activities on our behalf, information requests, interests & order fulfillment. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes. 

In addition, unless a user has elected not to receive our offers and third-party offers and promotions or to limit or prohibit disclosure of information about them, we may provide individual user information to our advertising and marketing partners, our affiliated companies, or other third parties interested in marketing to our Sites' users. We make an effort to provide users and subscribers with ads and offers that they may find of interest and of some value. Nevertheless, it is our policy to allow users to make the choices about, and to control, the information our Sites collect and the manner in which that information is used. For this reason, users always have the ability to update, change or delete information about them collected by the Sites, to unsubscribe from any mailing list at any time, to opt out of receiving third-party ads, promotions and offers, and to prevent disclosure of their information to third-parties for such purposes. We reserve the right to, in connection with a transfer of any of our assets to any affiliated company, provide user information and data to the affiliate subject to the terms of this policy. Similarly, we reserve the right to, in connection with a sale of any of our assets or businesses to a third party, sell our customer database, or relevant portion thereof, so that a third-party may be able to continue to provide the services and features to which our users have subscribed. We may release user information if required by law, to enforce any terms of service, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our Sites, its registered users, or others. Please note that our privacy policy does not apply to websites or web pages that link to our Sites.

You may, at any time, notify us that you do not wish to have your personal information disclosed to third parties for offers and promotions by sending an e-mail to privacy@cunetcorp.comÂ 

**How We Use Financial Information**

Financial information is used to bill you for products and services.

**Other Sites**

Other sites accessible through our Sites have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each site's privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. Please be aware that our Sites may contain links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties. The information practices of those websites linked to our Sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Additionally, other companies that place advertising on our Sites may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies. We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.

On behalf of various sponsors, we may provide sponsored links to third-party websites. If you click on a sponsored link or banner ad, a "window" or "frame" containing a third-party's web site may appear in the foreground with a Site in the background. Unless you are on one of our Sites, any time that you have moved to a window, you should assume that your personal information is being collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the windowed site's privacy policy (if any). If you are unsure as to whose privacy policy applies, please contact us by e-mail at privacy@cunetcorp.com.

The Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We encrypt all of your personal and financial information and use our best efforts to prevent it from being read or intercepted as the information travels over the Internet. While we are committed to protecting your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.

**Accessing Your Information**

At your request, we will modify or remove personal information that you have provided to us. You may do so by e-mailing privacy@cunetcorp.com. However, changing or deleting your information or otherwise opting-out of receipt of communications from us or third parties will only change or delete the data in our database for purposes of transacting future business on a Site and for managing future communications from us and third parties. These changes and deletions will not change or delete information already collected as part of a particular purchase in our transactions database, which may have already been shared with third parties, all as provided above in this Privacy Policy. You will need to contact third parties who may contact you directly to change your preferences or your personal information that they may be using to contact you.
