# Privacy Policy - Collectibles Today

  
  
Shopping online at collectiblestoday.com is extremely safe. Collectibles Today uses secure Application Servers to protect your ordering information as it comes to us via the Internet. This means that all information, such as name, address and your credit card number you enter in the checkout section of our online store is encrypted. VeriSign provides authentication that you are in direct communication with collectiblestoday.com. 

If you have any concerns about ordering electronically, please call 1-800-458-1925 to place your order over the phone.

  
  
  
Collectibles Today is the Internet marketing arm of The Bradford Group. We at the Bradford Group are committed to protecting our customers' privacy. We know that you are concerned about how your information is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. The following notice describes our privacy policy. 

Automatic Information:   
This is information provided by cookies. Cookies are small alphanumeric identifier files that store information. They enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide important features that personalize our site to make your shopping faster and easier. For example they store your cart information between your visits.

You can prevent your browser from accepting cookies through its help feature, but that prevents you from shopping on our site. We recommend that you take full advantage of all the features we've designed to make shopping easy and fun.

Information That We Collect From Every Visitor:   
We collect anonymous cookie information about the site pages, items, stores, and articles you view. This is not used with personally identifiable information (such as the name and address you give us when you place an order), but as aggregate information (group information) that helps us learn more about how people use and react to our site. We store information about the items you add to your cart so your cart selections are not lost between visits, but will not know who placed the items in the cart unless you send an order.

We also send or permit collection of anonymous user information by service providers such as Coremetrics and ForeSee Results, who help us analyze information about user visits, and improve services. If you would like to change your settings or opt out of the Coremetrics service, please click here. Note that by opting out of Coremetrics, you also opt out of ForeSee Results. 

Personal Information You Give Us:   
When you place an order, we will need your name, phone number, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date so that we can process and contact you about the order. We will keep a record of this information and the items you purchase. This allows us to process and fulfill your orders and return requests, and to send you information that's of interest.

You do not have to register at our site to place an order, but ordering is much simpler when you are registered. You will choose a login name and password that will allow you to update your personal information at any time in the future. When you log on with your password, your name, address and other contact information will automatically be entered into the correct spaces of your order form. Also, you can log on with your password, and track the status of orders you have given us. Our personal registration services are provided free of charge, and you are under no obligation to purchase anything.

Periodically, Collectibles Today will ask customers to participate in contests and surveys. If you participate, the information we collect may be associated with your account, and used to improve your overall customer experience.

E-mail:   
When you order an item, a catalog, or have a customer service request, we send you an e-mail to confirm that we received your request or to answer your inquiry. These messages are generated automatically, and are sent regardless of "no-e-mail" requests. If you prefer not to receive other types of e-mail, you can indicate your preference when you receive an e-mail from us. We have an opt-out feature on every e-mail that we mail out. Or, you can respond to an e-mail and request to be removed. You can also use the contact us feature on our site or phone us at 1-877-268-6638 to let us know that you prefer not to receive offers by e-mail. Please remember that if you add or change e-mail addresses, you need to separately notify us about your preferences for those e-mail addresses.

Information Sharing:   
Collectibles Today is one of a network of related companies who specialize in various high quality collectible products such as collectors plates, dolls, figurines, ornaments and music boxes. Our affiliated companies include:

We sell products from these affiliates and share information about your purchases with them. On occasion you may receive offers mailed by post from our affiliates for other products that they believe you may enjoy. 

We share certain collections of personal information that we regard as non-sensitive with selected third parties, such as mailing list brokers and database marketers. These entities may collect and use the information alone or in combination with customer information supplied by other companies, and share it with other companies for marketing purposes in the form of mailing lists. Our contracts with such third parties prohibit them from using or permitting use of the information we provide to generate reports about specific individuals, and require that they honor our customers' do-not-call, do-not-mail, and do-not-email requests when our information is used. We occasionally do list exchanges in which we provide mailing lists containing certain customers name and contact information to third parties in exchange for mailing lists with such information concerning the other company's customers. From time to time we may use your personal information to send you offers that may interest you on behalf of third parties. If you respond to a third party offer you receive from us or from a company that has used a mailing list generated from our customer information, you will become that business's customer and the personal information you voluntarily submit to it will be subject to that company's privacy policy, not ours.

If you object to our sharing information about you as a customer with these affiliated and non-affiliated companies, or if you prefer not to receive postal mail from us or other companies, you may use the [contact us](https://web.archive.org/ct/cs/cs_contactus_email.jsp) feature on our site, or phone us at 1-877-268-6638 to tell us about your preferences. 

Even if you opt out from information sharing generally, we must share information about your individual orders with the sister corporation that packs, ships and bills your purchases, and with outside companies on a confidential basis as needed to obtain approval to charge your credit card, to verify your address, and to deliver your orders. 

When you visit our website from a link on another website, or in an ad or e-mail, a cookie will be placed on your computer, and if you make a purchase, information may be provided to the referring website. This information is not personally identifiable. This will occur even if you opt out from other types of information sharing. 

We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Collectibles Today, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, collecting unpaid purchase balances, and reducing credit risks. This protects you from price increases related to uncollected debt. 

Our business referral program is provided by an outside company. If you choose to use this optional service, then they may share your information with us, but are not authorized to contact you or provide your information to others, without your permission. 

Children:   
collectiblestoday.com is a shopping site for mature collectors. We do not knowingly solicit data from, or market to, children under age 13. 

Customer Information Transfer:   
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses and assets, including customer information. 

Visit Us Often:   
Please visit this Privacy Policy frequently, as our business changes all the time, and we update this policy to reflect those changes. By visiting our site you agree that we may collect and use information as stated in our privacy policy. If we change our privacy policy, we will post the changes on this page so you are always informed about what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
