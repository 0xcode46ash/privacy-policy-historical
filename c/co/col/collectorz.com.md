#### Order Information

For the purpose of fulfilling orders, we collect contact information (name, address, country, zipcode and email address).  
We do not receive or store financial information for credit card orders. These are processed securely using 128-bit encryption by specialized order processing companies [Plimus](http://www.plimus.com/) and [SWREG](http://www.swreg.org/). For bank transfers directly into our account, we do receive the account number from our bank.
