**3\. General Information**

When you go to a website, the pages you see, along with a short text file called a 'cookie', are downloaded to your computer. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there from the last visit.

Information supplied by cookies helps HarperCollins to provide all users of our websites with a better experience. It also assists us to analyse the profile and frequency of our visitors.

HarperCollins use independent measurement and research companies, to analyse non-personal information regarding the visitors to our website on our behalf using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on our website. HarperCollins uses this type of information, as with that obtained from other cookies used on the site, to help it improve the services to its users.

**4\. What is a cookie?**

A "cookie" is a small piece of information/data sent by a web page server to be stored on your computer’s hard drive, so it can be read back later from that browser. A cookie is generated by a web page server, which is basically the computer that operates a web site.

An example is when a browser stores your User IDs and password, so that you do not have to type them into the website on every visit. Cookies are also used to store preferences of start pages or favourite items when you visit a web page. Cookies tell a website when a user has returned and your website preferences.

Many website owners use cookies whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.

From time to time, we may use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information and newsletters relating to our goods and services. We will always give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such direct marketing or market research contact each time you receive a new item of information. HarperCollins will not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information to others unless we have obtained your express permission or are required to do so by law.

Where personal information is held for people who are not a registered user of a HarperCollins website, but have taken part in other services (e.g. competitions), that information will be held as long as is necessary to ensure that the service is run smoothly.
