###  Your personal information on the web

We do not collect personal information when you visit our site unless you apply for a card online or register for access to the Online Service Centre. If you would like to know more about our privacy practices concerning your personal information, please refer to the [ Important Privacy Notices of GECFA](http://gemoney.com.au/en/privacy_policy.html) and of Coles Group Limited and their related bodies.

###  Applying for a card on the web

When you apply for a Coles MasterCard online, the Important Privacy Notices provide detailed information about the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information and informs you of other matters of which the Privacy Act requires us to make you aware. You should read these carefully.

###  Online Service Centre

When you register for access to the Online Service Centre, the information collected is compared with the details we already have stored, such as your name, date of birth and Coles MasterCard card number, which we have previously collected from you so we can verify that you are the person seeking access to your personal information. If you do not provide the information requested, you will not be able to access the Online Service Centre.

When you submit feedback or questions via email, it is very important that you do not disclose any details that could be used by others to gain access to your account. This includes private details such as your username, password or Coles MasterCard number.

To ensure we properly protect your privacy and for security reasons, we cannot respond to your query via email if the answer would disclose account information personal to you. You will be directed to contact us using another method if this occurs.

###  Cookies

A cookie is a tiny element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive, so you can be recognised when you return.

You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.

Cookies are used on this web site to monitor the traffic to the site. They are used to count the number of visitors to each page and to track the path each visitor takes to navigate this web site, but no personal information about you is collected during this process.

The Online Service Centre uses cookies as part of the registration process. They are used to store the username while the customer is using the Service Centre and to track the number of times the user has tried to log in during a single visit. They are not used for any other purpose on this site.

###  Web site security

We use high security levels for our Online Service Centre and when you apply for a Coles MasterCard online. We use security levels which are standard for internet banking and large scale e-commerce sites. You can check the security level of a web page by clicking on your internet browser's padlock or key icon.

Encryption is the standard way of protecting your information as it is transmitted between you and us. This involves converting the information into an unreadable code using a "key" (and also de-coding it using this "key"). The longer the key, the more difficult it is for others to break the encrypted code.

To access the Online Service Centre or to apply for a Coles MasterCard online, your browser needs to be enabled to access these secure sites.
