# Collective

## JULY 6, 2015

The protection of individual privacy is critically important to us. Collective’s combination of proprietary and partner technology allows us to deliver relevant, targeted content to individuals, but not at the expense of individual privacy.

This Privacy Policy describes how we gather information from you when you visit the web sites of Collective and when we serve advertisements on our network of web sites, why we collect this information, and how we may use and share this information.

### DATA COLLECTION

Collective may collect Data from your computer or device when you are visiting a Collective web site or on a third party’s behalf when we serve advertisements on our network of web sites. This Data may include information such as your IP address, web pages which have been viewed by you, date and time, domain type, and your responses to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor. This is information which does not immediately reveal your identity. Nor will we use this information to attempt to discern your identity.

We may use different types of technologies, such as cookies, pixels, and other technologies to collect this Data. We do not collect the following information that identifies you: your name, address, email address, and telephone number (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”) unless you choose to provide it to us. We do not combine the data we collect with this PII. You may elect not to allow us to use Data for delivering targeted advertising by following the Choice procedures set forth below.

We do not ask for PII other than as outlined below for business purposes. We don’t collect PII via our corporate Web site, www.collective.com unless you choose to provide it to us – for example, by sending us your PII in an email. Some of the Collective partner websites may ask people to register and provide PII. None of this PII is combined by Collective with other Data and/or used by Collective for our ad serving.

### NON-SENSITIVE HEALTH DATA

Where permitted by applicable laws governing online privacy, Collective uses non-sensitive health-related data segments to serve or optimize advertisements. In order to provide transparency around these data segments, please [click here](http://www.collective.com/nonsensitive/) to view our list.

### HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

Collective may use your Data to better target advertisements and other content to individuals in an effort to create a more relevant experience for each person.

The Data is also used for operation and system management purposes including compliance, public purpose and consumer safety, authentication, verification, fraud prevention and security, billing or product or service fulfillment, or ad reporting or delivery, and market research or product development and as otherwise permitted under the NAI and DAA Principles (see below).

This information may also be combined with data from other sources, and shared with our affiliates and partners for similar use.

### INFORMATION REQUESTS

Any PII you provide may be used by Collective to contact you about services or information requested by you and may be shared between our offices in the United States and the United Kingdom for this purpose. We may share this information with third parties who provide administrative services on our behalf (and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information), as well as pursuant to a court order or to law enforcement or government officials, or otherwise to protect the legal rights or legitimate interests of Collective, its affiliates, partners, and each of their respective investors, directors, officers, employees, agents and suppliers.

From time to time, Collective may conduct surveys through various online methods. When participating in a survey, we may ask you to provide PII. The PII you submit in a survey may be used by Collective for research and measurement purposes, including to measure the effectiveness of content, advertising or programs. If you wish to contact us about surveys conducted by Collective, you can reach us by email at [surveys@collective.com](mailto:surveys@collective.com).

#### COOKIES

A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s hard drive containing information about the user. We use cookies, for example, to provide information to advertisers on users’ web browsing activity. We believe this enables us and our advertiser clients to provide users with a more meaningful web experience.

### CHOICE AND OPT-OUT

Collective is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”), and adheres to their respective self-regulatory codes. The NAI and DAA administer programs that provide consumer awareness and choices regarding web viewing data. As a member of these programs, we provide choice via the DAA choice tool. Additionally, Collective may partner with other advertising networks and providers to deliver ads on our behalf, or on behalf of others, across the Internet. These third party companies may collect information about your visits to our web site in order to provide you with more relevant advertising on other websites.

If you’d like to exercise that choice with respect to Collective’s or other DAA participants’ collection of data from your browser or device in connection with tailoring ads, please  
[click here www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). When you exercise choice, Collective and/or other DAA participating companies will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The Collective opt-out cookie tells us not to collect data from your browser or device to tailor online advertisement campaigns.

### BUSINESS SALE

As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, we reserve the right to include any information we have among the assets transferred to the acquiring company.

### CHILDREN

Collective does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 through Collective.com, nor via any of our network of websites. If you are under 13, please do not give us any personal information. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to instruct their children to never provide personal information on any website without parental permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to Collective, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our database. Collective complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.

### LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES

This Privacy Policy may contain links to third-party sites, which are maintained by third parties. Please be aware that we are not responsible for and cannot control the privacy policies of these other linked sites or their practices. We suggest that you visit those sites directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection and distribution policies because they may differ from Collective’s own position under this Privacy Policy.

### SECURITY

We have reasonable security measures in place intended to help protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of any Data collected. This includes, but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption. However, we are unable to guarantee that the security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that your information will remain secure under all circumstances.

We retain Data used for advertising purpose for up to two years from the last interaction between our cookie and your browser or device.

### CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date listed at the top of this policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post prior notice of any such changes on our web site.
