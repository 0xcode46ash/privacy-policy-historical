### Data Use and Sharing

Personal information you provide may be used by Collective to contact you about services or information requested by you and may be shared between our offices in the United States for this purpose. We may also use personal information to enhance the services offered on our website and to tailor advertising. We may share this information with third parties who provide administrative services on our behalf, as well as pursuant to a court order or to law enforcement or government officials, or otherwise to protect the legal rights or legitimate interests of Collective, its affiliates, partners, and each of their respective investors, directors, officers, employees, agents and suppliers.

### CHOICE AND OPT-OUT

Collective is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”), and adheres to their respective self-regulatory codes. The NAI and DAA administer programs that provide consumer awareness and choices regarding web viewing data. As a member of these programs, we provide choice via the [DAA](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) and [NAI](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) choice tool. Additionally, Collective may partner with other advertising networks and providers to deliver ads on our behalf, or on behalf of others, across the Internet. These third party companies may collect information about your visits to our website in order to provide you with more relevant advertising on other websites. If you’d like to exercise that choice with respect to Collective’s or other DAA participants’ collection and use of data from your browser in connection with interest-based advertising, please click here [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices). Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. In addition, note that if you use a different browser or delete cookies from your browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

### BUSINESS SALE
