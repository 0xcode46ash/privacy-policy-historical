· The third party assists Columbia Sportswear in the processing of orders and the delivery of products or services to you.   
· The information is shared with a company that is more than 50% owned by Columbia Sportswear, or is licensed to provide Columbia Sportswear branded products and services.

· If Columbia Sportswear goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, your personal information will usually be part of the assets transferred. Thirty (30) days advance notice of such a transfer will be posted on the Columbia Sportswear Web site, and any transferee will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

Columbia Sportswear uses non-personally identifiable information in any way that it determines is useful to it, including to maintain and improve the quality of its products and services and to offer information and promotions.

**Cookies.** A "cookie" is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a site like the Columbia Sportswear web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the site administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the site. If your browser accepts "cookies," Columbia Sportswear may use both persistent and session ID cookies to determine if you are a repeat or new visitor; to understand how many different visitors come to this site; to personalize your information on future visits; to offer you information that is appropriate to your demographics interests, and preferences; to monitor and improve its services to you; and to facilitate your shopping session. You can usually modify your browser to decline cookies at your preference, however, declining cookies may limit your ability to receive the benefit of all of the features of this site.

**Change to Use of Information**. If any material change is made in the way in which we use the personally identifiable information that you previously provided to us, Columbia Sportswear will notify you of the change and provide you with an opportunity to "opt out" of having your information used for a different purpose. We will also update this Privacy Policy as changes are made going forward by posting the change on the Columbia Sportswear website.

**Security.** Your personally identifiable information is stored on computer servers in a controlled environment, reasonably protected from unauthorized access, misuse, alteration or disclosure. Although Columbia Sportswear strives to secure your personally identifiable information with the same degree of care that it secures its own confidential information, there can be no assurances that your information will remain confidential. Storage and processing may take place in the United States or in any other country where Columbia Sportswear or its affiliates maintain facilities. By using the Columbia Sportswear web site or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY, SO THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
