  * Coles will not use your information for purposes unrelated to the services we provide, unless we first obtain your consent.
  * Wherever possible Coles will give you the option of interacting anonymously with us provided it is practicable and lawful to do so.
  * We will always use fair and lawful means of collecting personal information.
  * In most circumstances we will collect personal information directly from you. 



## What personal information do we collect?

Different personal information is collected for different reasons. The personal information we collect is in most cases supplied directly by you when you give us your details, place an order, seek a refund without a receipt, or provide feedback to us.

Personal information can include information such as your name, address, contact details and shopping purchases.

The type of service or interaction you wish to receive will determine the specific type of information we need to collect. Personal information may include the following:

Name, address, phone and other contact details (fax, email etc), merchandise information (purchases, orders etc), and method of payment.

Depending on the circumstance, sometimes we collect other information such as where you shop or what your areas of interest are, so that we can improve our service offering to you. Through business partners such as FlyBuys and GE Capital Finance, who administer our store cards, we may also collect transaction information.

You can decline cookies by adjusting the “accept cookies” setting in your browser, however this may affect the functionality of the web site.

## Why we collect information

## Who we may share your information with

Coles has no intention of selling your personal information to other parties, unless consent has been sought from you first or if we have already told you about the disclosure. Coles may sell personal information (such as name and address) of Coles Baby Club members to third parties for the purpose of promotional and direct marketing offers which Coles believes may be of interest to certain Coles Baby Club members.

We also often need to pass personal details such as your name and address to companies who perform parts of our service delivery. This includes organisations such as Coles Group Limited, GE Capital, FlyBuys and delivery companies, external (non-Coles) call centres, mail houses and third party fulfilment contractors.

In all circumstances where your personal information is disclosed, Coles will ensure that these third parties undertake to protect your privacy.

## Security

We will take all reasonable steps to store your personal information securely. In particular, we want you to feel confident in dealing with us on the internet.

Coles Supermarket feedback, contact & application forms use a process called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL locks all information passed from you to us in an encrypted envelope making it extremely difficult for this information to be intercepted.
