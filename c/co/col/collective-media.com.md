# Privacy | Collective | The Audience Engine™

This Privacy Policy describes how we gather information from you when you visit the web sites of Collective and when we serve advertisements on our network of web sites, why we collect this information, and how we may use and share this information. For more details on our practices, [contact us](mailto:contactus@collective.com?subject=Privacy).

If you'd like to opt-out from having Collective collect your Non-PII (defined below) in connection with tailoring ads on our network of web sites,[please click here](http://optout.collective-media.net/optout?). When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie tells us not to collect your Non-PII to tailor online advertisement campaigns.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”)

  
Collective may collect Non-PII while you are visiting a Collective web site or when we serve advertisements on our network of web sites. This anonymous data includes, but not limited to, information such as your IP address, web pages which have been viewed by you, date and time, domain type, and your responses to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor. This type of information may be collected using different types of technologies, such as cookies and pixels. This information is not combined with PII. You may elect not to allow us to use non-PII by following the Opt-Out procedures set forth below.

Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)

  
PII is information that identifies you or can be used to identify, contact, or locate you, such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number. We do not ask for PII other than as outlined below for business purposes. We don’t collect PII via our corporate Web site, [www.collective.com](http://www.collective.com/ "www.collective.com") unless you choose to provide it to us – for example, by sending us your PII in an email.

Some of the Collective partner websites may ask people to register and provide PII. None of this PII is combined with non-PII and/or used by Collective for our anonymous ad serving. Collective is committed to making sure that our partners provide notice and choice to all consumers.

Information that is obtained from Collective.com

At Collective.com, we collect PII only when you choose to provide it to us. For example, if you choose to provide us with your PII in an email, we will use it for the reason it was provided. We also collect Non-PII via Collective.com, and use this information to help administer Collective.com.

Sensitive Data Segments

Collective uses non-sensitive health-related data segments to serve or optimize advertisements. In order to provide transparency around these data segments, we have provided a list [here](http://collective.com/about/oba-compliance).

How We Use Your Information

  
Collective may use your non-PII to better target advertisements and other content to individuals in an effort to create a more relevant experience for each person. The non-PII is also used to predict responses to advertisements, to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals, and to provide aggregate reporting to advertisers and clients and for our internal purposes.

This information may also be combined with information from other sources, and shared with our affiliates and partners for similar use.

We may retain information used to provide you better tailored ads up to 30 days. Aggregate reports generated from such information may be kept longer.

We may share this information with third parties who provide administrative services (and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information), as well as pursuant to a court order or to law enforcement or government officials as we deem necessary or appropriate.

Opt-Out

Collective is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative, which is a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards.

If you'd like to opt-out from having Collective collect your Non-PII in connection with serving ads on our network of web sites, [please click here](http://optout.collective-media.net/optout?). When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie tells us not to collect your Non-PII to tailor online advertisement campaigns. Please note that if you change your computer, change your Internet browser (e.g. from Internet Explorer to Firefox), or delete all your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out.

Collective uses the Evidon assurance platform to help comply with the cross‐industry Self‐Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) ([http:///aboutads.info](http://aboutads.info/ "http:///aboutads.info")). As part of this service, online advertisements served by Collective are sometimes delivered with icons that help consumers understand how their data is being used and provide choice options to consumers that want more control.

Business Transfers

As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, we reserve the right to include any information we have among the assets transferred to the acquiring company. We will notify you of this event as detailed below in “Changes to Our Privacy Policy”.

Children

Collective does not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of 13 through Collective.com, nor via any of our network of websites. If you are under 13, please do not give us any PII. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to instruct their children to never provide PII on any website without parental permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided PII to Collective, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

Links to Other Web Sites

This Privacy Policy applies only to our web sites and not to any third party sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection and distribution policies.

Security

We have reasonable security measures in place intended to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of any personal information collected. This includes, but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption. However, we are unable to guarantee that the security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that your information will remain secure under all circumstances.

Changes to Our Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of October 2011. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post prior notice of any such changes on our web site. Our use of information collected prior to a material change in this Privacy Policy shall continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy that is in effect at the time the information was collected, unless you opt in to allow the information to be governed by the new policy. Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis.
