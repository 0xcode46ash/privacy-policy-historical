We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, to tailor site content and to format the site and software to user needs, and to generate aggregate statistical reports. We may use aggregate visitor data to prepare publicly displayed reports regarding the traffic on our site or on individual pages, site popularity rankings, and referrers that visitors use to access individual web pages.

### **Gathering of Personally Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to Colorado College’s websites choose to interact with the college in ways that require the college to gather personally identifying information.

For example, prospective students who engage in the application process are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those applications. In each case, Colorado College collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with the college. Colorado College does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described below.
