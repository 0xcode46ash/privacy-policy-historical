## What types of personal information do we collect and how do we use it?

_Account information._ When you register with CollectiveX, we will request some personal information, including your first and last name, email address, and password to create your account. Your password will be maintained on our system in an encrypted form.

_Group data and contents and usage._ The contents of your CollectiveX account are stored and maintained on CollectiveX servers in order to provide the service. Because we keep back-up copies of data for the purposes of recovery from errors or system failure, residual copies of group contents may remain on our systems for some time, even after you have deleted information or after the termination of your account. CollectiveX employees do not access the content of any accounts unless you specifically request them to do so (for example, if you are having technical difficulties accessing your account) or if required by law, to maintain our system, or to protect CollectiveX or the public.

We also may collect information about the use of your account, such as how much bandwidth you are using, how often you log in and other information related to your use of CollectiveX. Information displayed or clicked on in your CollectiveX account (including user interface elements, links, and other information) is also recorded. We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you, such as improving the CollectiveX user experience.
