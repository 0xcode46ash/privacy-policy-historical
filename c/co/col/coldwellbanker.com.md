# Privacy Statement | Coldwell Banker

Coldwell Banker Real Estate LLC operates the web site at www.coldwellbanker.com ("Site").

We respect the privacy of each user of the Site (referred to as "you" or "a user"), whether you are just beginning your real estate search or have already become a customer. This Privacy Statement gives you specific information about how we protect your privacy, how we treat information we collect on the Site that identifies an individual user ("Personal Information"), and how we use aggregated information.

BY REGISTERING FOR OR USING THE SITE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT, YOU CANNOT USE THE SITE. We reserve the right to modify this Statement at any time by posting a notice on the Site's home page. (If we consider it appropriate, we may also provide additional notice of significant changes.) Your use of the Site after the date of the last modification listed at the beginning of this Privacy Statement indicates to us that you agree to the changes.

Location of Servers and Transfer of Information to the United States

The Site is hosted by servers in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, your Personal Information will be transferred to the United States. By submitting your Personal Information, you consent to its transfer to the United States and to its storage, processing, and use there in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

Scope of this Privacy Statement

This Privacy Statement applies to your use of this Site only. We do not own, operate or control the web sites of our Franchisees or sales associates. Accordingly, this Statement does not apply to a Franchisee's or sales associate's web site or to a Franchisee's or sales associate's collection, use, storage and disclosure of your Personal Information.

1\. Collection and Use of Your Personal Information

We collect your Personal Information on the Site in order to enhance the services we offer you. We collect Personal Information from you only when you voluntarily submit it in order to obtain certain services or information, including (A) registrations for special communications, such as saving a search for you and, but only if you request it, sending you new listings that fit the profile of your saved search; (B) requests to find a property, to list your property, and to find a sales associate; (C) requests to contact us; (D) requests to receive periodic industry updates; (E) requests to email a listing to a friend; and (F) applications for employment.

If you submit a request through this Site to find or list a property or to find a sales associate, you will be asked to provide Personal Information and we refer this information to Franchisees or sales associates to respond to your request. For example, if you ask that we list your property or if you ask to see more listings in a given area, you will be directed to a Franchisee in that area.

If you contact us, we collect Personal Information, which is retained or referred to an independent Franchisee or sales associate depending on the nature of your inquiry. If you are looking for a property or a sales associate, it is referred to a Franchisee or sales associate; if your inquiry or complaint requires a response from us, it is referred to the appropriate department for research and a response. The information we collect is not used in any other way and is not retained after one year.

If you choose to send a listing to a friend, you will be asked to provide the friend's email address. We do not store this information, and the information is used only to send the one-time referral email.

If you are seeking employment, you will be asked to provide Personal Information about yourself. We refer this information to Franchisees in the geographic area in which you live. If you have sought employment at our company headquarters, the information is forwarded to our Corporate Human Resources Department.

2\. Collection of Non-Personal Information

Even if you do not send us any Personal Information, we collect information about how you use our site ("Non-Personal Information"). This information cannot be used to identify you personally and is explained in more detail below under "Non-Personal Information".

A cookie is a small data file, often including an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent from a web site's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Use of cookies is common on the Internet. A web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser permits a web site to access only the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. But if you refuse cookies, some parts of the Site will not function properly and may not provide services or information you have requested.

Like many sites, we obtain Non-Personal Information such as IP (internet protocol) addresses, browser types, the name of your ISP (internet service provider), information about where a user comes from before arriving at our Site, what pages a user visits, the order of those pages, and the amount of time spent on each. A vendor performs this service for us by sending a cookie to gather this information, compile it, and report to us. We use Non-Personal Information to customize the advertising and content you see, improve our services, conduct research, and provide anonymous aggregated reporting for internal audits and third-parties.

We send to your web browser some of the advertisements you see when you use our network of web sites. However, we also allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our web pages. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network web site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from the web site. Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. As always, remember we authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies only for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any Personal Information about you.

3\. Use of Information

We use the Personal Information and the Non-Personal Information we collect on the Site (A) to provide you with the services that you ask to receive through the Site, including saving searches and, if you request it, sending you updates about those searches, (B) to receive, if you choose, to receive periodic industry updates, (C) to answer your questions or complaints, (D) to refer you to Franchisees and sales associates about finding or listing a property or to locate a sale associate; (E) to refer a listing to a friend, and (F) for analytical purposes to help us improve the Site and for our business generally.

We may also use the Personal Information to inform you about other services and products that may be available through us, our family of companies, our franchisees and/or companies with which we have a marketing relationship, and to provide you a customer survey to assess your satisfaction with our services and products.

We may allow others to provide audience measurement and analytics services for us, to serve advertisements on our behalf, and to track and report on the performance of those advertisements. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, SDKs, and other technologies to identify your device when you use the Site, as well as when you visit other online sites and services, and such services will be covered by the privacy policy of the respective third parties.

We use Google Analytics to collect information about use of the Site. More information on Google Analytics – including how you can control the information sent to Google - can be found here: [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners)

If you have registered an account with the Coldwell Banker platform, your activity may be tracked using Google Analytics to provide cross-device usage reports. This data is not publicly shared, and contains no personally identifiable information. All data from these reports are used to evaluate and improve the experience of interacting with the Coldwell Banker platform. User activity is referenced using the Coldwell Banker user ID and does not share user email or name.
