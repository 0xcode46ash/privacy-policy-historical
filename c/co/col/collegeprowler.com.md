## Web Site Users

College Prowler generally collects personally identifiable information such as a name, postal address, E-mail address, telephone number, or credit card information with your specific knowledge and consent. 

### How does the Web site use information supplied by me?

Occasionally, visitors to our Web site may be asked to supply certain personally identifying information, which is then retained by College Prowler. For example, we ask you for certain information if you choose to subscribe to our E-mail newsletters, our online discussion forums, or our premium online content. If you choose to give us personally identifying information at such time, such information will be retained by us and used only to provide you with products or services you have requested, or with additional information from College Prowler about College Prowler, its affiliates, or selected outside companies whose products or services we feel may be of use to you. Any information from selected outside companies will be transmitted by College Prowler so that such companies will not have access either to your E-mail address or to your other personally identifying information. Moreover, we will not sell or rent this personally identifying information to any other company or organization. 

If, at some point after giving College Prowler your personally identifying information, you do not wish to continue to receive additional information from College Prowler about College Prowler, its affiliates, or selected outside companies, in general, you may opt out by E-mailing [support@collegeprowler.com](mailto:support@collegeprowler.com) and put the words "remove my name" in the subject line of your E-mail; in the case of our E-mail newsletters, you may opt out by clicking on the "opt out" link at the end of each E-mail. 

From time to time, the personally identifying information that you provide to us may be shared with our suppliers or service providers who assist us in maintaining and managing our newsletters, our archives, our premium online content, our online discussion forums, and other activities on the Web site. Such suppliers or service providers may use your personally identifying information only in the course of providing services to College Prowler, but they may not use such information for other purposes. 

While your individual information is protected as discussed above, College Prowler reserves the right to use such individual information to create aggregated, anonymous data about users in order to develop statistics about activity on and visitors to the Web site. In addition, College Prowler may disclose personal information if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Web site; or (4) protect the personal safety, property, or rights of our users or the public. 

### College Prowler Scholarship Applicants

If you chose to receive College Prowler tips and offers from our trusted business partners, College Prowler inc. has the right to use your personal information and may sell or transfer it with our trusted business partners. If after opting in you no longer wish to receive additional information from College Prowler, its affiliates, or trusted business partners you may opt out by E-mailing [support@collegeprowler.com](mailto:support@collegeprowler.com) and put the words "remove my name" in the subject line of the E-mail; in the case of our E-mail newsletters, you may opt out by clicking on the "opt out" link at the end of each E-mail. 

### What are "cookies" and how do you use them?

"Cookies" are pieces of information that are placed by a Web site in a storage place on your computer. Cookies do not contain information that is, in itself, personally identifying. Cookies are placed on your computer in a limited way to help deliver advertisements, to calculate unique site visitors, and to track usage throughout our site. Other uses include placement of cookies to make the login process more convenient for users of our E-mail newsletters, our archives, our premium online content, and our online discussion forums. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use cookies to collect information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please go to <http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html>. 

In addition, we contract with certain third parties to help manage and optimize our Web site business. These companies may use Web beacons and cookies to help us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. If you would like more information about this practice, you can e-mail [support@collegeprowler.com](mailto:support@collegeprowler.com). 

### How is my credit card information used when I make a purchase?

When you make a purchase, we ask you to provide your credit card information so that we can process your payment. During the ordering process, such credit card information is transmitted to College Prowler (in the case of our premium online content) or (in the case of our archives, subscriptions, and mail order products) to one of our suppliers or service providers. In both cases, credit card information is then transmitted to third-party credit card processors and card issuers that must use your information to process your order. 

## College Prowler Customers

From time to time, College Prowler is approached by third parties interested in contacting our readers, people who have purchased a book through our site or a premium online service. Perhaps they are in a similar business or have a product to offer that would interest our subscribers. We may provide our mailing list of readers to such third parties if we believe our readers would be interested in hearing from them. Many of our readers find this a valuable and timesaving service. If you have bought a guide from us and want us to exclude your name from mailing lists provided to third parties, mail a letter to the address below, or E-mail us at the address below with your request. Please specify that you would like your name removed from the mailing list, and include your full name and address or the address label from your magazine. Mail your request to: College Prowler, Mailing List, Pittsburgh, PA. 15213 or send an E-mail to support@collegeprowler.com. Please allow six to eight weeks for your request to take effect. 

## Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

No one under the age of 13 should provide any personal information. In general, College Prowler does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If in limited circumstances we do knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, we will do so only with verified parental consent prior to collection. In the event that we learn that we have collected information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete this information from our database as quickly as possible. If you believe the Web site has any information about anyone under 13, please contact us at support@collegeprowler.com.
