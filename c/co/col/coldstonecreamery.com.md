This Privacy Statement outlines our personal information handling practices. Wherever COLD STONE CREAMERY collects personal information we will provide a link to this Privacy Statement located generally at the bottom of the page of the web site. Once you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with the terms of our Privacy Statement.

However, if you choose not to provide your personal information, you may not be able to access particular areas of our website, order certificates, obtain franchise information, enter contests, request samples, or send us e-mail.

## What kind of personally identifiable information do we collect, and who is collecting it?

COLD STONE CREAMERY only gathers personal information when voluntarily submitted by you. If you request information from COLD STONE CREAMERY, or wish to share an experience you had at one of our franchise stores, we'll ask for personal information such as your name, address, and email address, as well as store address and any other information you may wish to share, so that we can best respond to your comments. This information will help us to better customize The Ultimate Ice Cream Experience® at COLD STONE CREAMERY. Additionally, if you contact COLD STONE CREAMERY, we may keep a record of that correspondence.

When you access certain areas of the COLD STONE CREAMERY web site, such as when you create a My Cold Stone account or purchase gift certificates, we will ask you for your registration or log in information. Such information can include your name, e-mail address, residence or billing addresses, product preferences, and credit card information (for online purchases). Other areas of the COLD STONE CREAMERY web site can include requests for information for prospective franchisees and vendors. These areas can include requests not only for the above type of information, but also requests for certain financial, credit and other sensitive personal information deemed necessary to evaluate your potential as a franchisee or vendor.

From time to time we and/or our partners will offer information for prospective franchisees, sponsor contests, sweepstakes, and special services that will require more information. COLD STONE CREAMERY partners or web sites that have links on our site may collect personal information about you. Please be aware that the information collected by these partners or websites is not covered under this Privacy Statement.

This aggregate information generally will not personally identify you or be correlated to you individually for external purposes. COLD STONE CREAMERY may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all of the aggregate information, provided that, such information does not personally identify you, and the aggregate information will not be used by other companies to contact you.

## How do we use the information we get, and with whom may it be shared?

COLD STONE CREAMERY collects information in order to provide our users with personalized and customized service. We will often use the information we collect to notify you of important functionality changes to COLD STONE CREAMERY, new services, and special offers or contests that we think you'll find valuable. COLD STONE CREAMERY researches our user demographics and interests based upon the information that you provide. We do this to better customize your experience, The Ultimate Ice Cream Experience®, and we may share this research with our partners.

COLD STONE CREAMERY may share personal information within the COLD STONE CREAMERY family, including the Corporation, our franchisees, our subsidiaries and our affiliates. Of course, any use of this information by the COLD STONE CREAMERY family will comply with this policy. Occasionally, with your permission, we will send marketing information to you, such as discount coupons, information about new product offerings, etc. Further, with your permission, we will, on occasion send marketing information on behalf of one of our business partners about products or services they provide that may be of interest to you. You may be asked if you wish to receive marketing materials from COLD STONE CREAMERY business partners. If you elect to receive such materials, COLD STONE CREAMERY will not share your personal information with such partners but rather will send a mailing or email on behalf of the partners. If you do not elect to receive such materials, please contact us at [service@coldstonecreamery.com](mailto:customerrelations@coldstonecreamery.com) and we will not send them to you.

Contests and promotions may be sponsored by companies other than COLD STONE CREAMERY or may be co-sponsored by COLD STONE CREAMERY and one of our partners. Our promotions, contests, and sweepstakes may often request additional information from sponsors. Some of the data collected may be shared with that partner or sponsor. When you request information, you give COLD STONE CREAMERY the permission to transfer your information to the sponsor so that they may answer your request. If you would rather not receive such information or have such information shared, please contact us at [service@coldstonecreamery.com](mailto:customerrelations@coldstonecreamery.com). If you have more than one COLD STONE CREAMERY account, make sure you change your preferences for each account or e-mail name you have with us.

Companies may be engaged by COLD STONE CREAMERY to perform a variety of functions, such as, fulfilling orders, assisting with promotions, providing technical services for our web sites, etc. These companies may have access to personal information if needed to perform such functions. However, these companies may only use such personal information for the purpose of performing that function and may not use it for any other purpose.

Further, the information collected through our web site is considered a trade secret of COLD STONE CREAMERY. As the owner of such information, we may disclose or sell such information as an asset of the company in conjunction with the sale to a third party of our company or a portion of our assets.

COLD STONE CREAMERY reserves the right to use or disclose any information when we have your permission or in special circumstances, such as when we have a good faith believe that such disclosure is necessary to comply with legal requirements, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the site, to fulfill your requests, to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an investigation on a matter of public safety, or to respond to claims that any files or data violate the rights of third-parties, or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of COLD STONE CREAMERY, its users, or the public. For example, COLD STONE CREAMERY will make such disclosures necessary under the reporting procedures of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (see the Terms of Use).

## How does COLD STONE CREAMERY protect your information?

When you submit any files, information, or access your account, COLD STONE CREAMERY uses a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all the information that you provide before it is sent to us. Additionally, we take reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to all of your data.

Your COLD STONE CREAMERY account is password-protected so that only you have access to this personal information. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. COLD STONE CREAMERY will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail.

Unfortunately, no data transmission can ever be 100% secure. While we try to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of the personal information that your transmit. You transmit such information at your own risk. Once we receive such information we will use our best efforts to maintain security on our system.

## How do we address the privacy of children?

COLD STONE CREAMERY is committed to protecting the online privacy of children and making the Internet safe for our users. For this reason, COLD STONE CREAMERY does not collect personal information from children under 13. Children 12 years old and younger may visit the COLD STONE CREAMERY web site under the supervision of a parent or guardian without disclosing any personally identifiable information. However, it is sometimes necessary to collect some personally identifiable information about children in order to allow them to use some features of our site (like joining the COLD STONE CREAMERY Birthday Club). Only a parent or guardian may register a child 12 or younger for the COLD STONE CREAMERY Birthday Club. When a parent registers a child for the Birthday Club, we request the child's name, date of birth, gender, and parent's e-mail address. We collect this information in order to verify the child's age, send personalized Birthday Club e-greetings, and provide special offers to Birthday Club members. Parents may, at any time, review the information they have provided about their children or request that we delete that information from our databases by writing to [service@coldstonecreamery.com](mailto:customerrelations@coldstonecreamery.com). We will not disclose any children's information to anyone outside of the COLD STONE CREAMERY family, including the Corporation, our franchisees, our subsidiaries and our affiliates. Our subsidiaries and affiliates may need children's personal information in order to fill an order, respond to a service request, or to provide Birthday Club member services, prevent fraud, or assist us in the management and improvement of our web site. Our franchisees may need children's personal information in order to help us provide Birthday Club member services and prevent fraud. We require our subsidiaries, affiliates, and franchisees to respect our privacy practices concerning children's information and not use children's information for purposes other than to carry out our instructions. We encourage parents of children under 13 to regularly check and monitor their children's use of e-mail and other activities on line.

## When do we make changes to our Privacy Statement?

From time to time, it may be necessary for COLD STONE CREAMERY to change this Privacy Statement, so we suggest that you check here periodically. Rest assured, however, that any changes will not be retroactively applied and will not alter how we handle previously collected information.

## Does COLD STONE CREAMERY allow customers to update or change their personally identifiable information?

Users of the COLD STONE CREAMERY web site may, at any time, review the personally identifiable information they have provided about themselves (and their family members) and make changes to that information via their My Cold Stone Account Details page. Users can also request that their My Cold Stone account be closed via the My Cold Stone Account Details page. Furthermore, users can request that COLD STONE CREAMERY delete all account information from our databases by writing to [service@coldstonecreamery.com](mailto:customerrelations@coldstonecreamery.com).
