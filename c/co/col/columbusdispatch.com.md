We ask for your home phone number to help us determine whether you are a print subscriber to _The Columbus Dispatch_ newspaper.

**Special note on children's privacy**

Dispatch.com and ColumbusNow.com are general audience Web sites. Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no Web site operator can require as a condition of participating in an activity that a child under the age of 13 disclose more information than is reasonably necessary. Dispatch.com and ColumbusNow.com abide by this requirement. 

Dispatch.com requires users to register and give us personally identifiable information -- name, address, email address -- in order to gain access to the site. ColumbusNow.com does not require registration but urges users to do so. If a child under 13 would like to register, we request that registration be completed by a parent or guardian. In addition, the two areas of Dispatch.com that are of specific interest to children -- the Now! for kids section and the Newspaper in Education section -- are available to all users without registration. 

If you register on behalf of a child, we suggest that the "Mailings" box on the registration page be left unchecked so that the child will receive no emailed promotional offers from us. We also offer users the option of completing a profile indicating their interests and giving us some demographic information including birthdate. If this information is completed on behalf of a child and indicates the child is under 13, that child will not receive any promotional email from us. We do not sell or share the personal information of any user, regardless of age, with third parties. 

The only other time children are invited to share information on Dispatch.com is when they participate in features of the NOW! section, such as contributing movie reviews, holiday greetings, short stories or entering contests. Children can respond to those features via U.S. mail or by email. This information -- the child's mailing address or email address -- is used or saved only to respond to the child if needed. It is not used for any other purpose. 

If a parent chooses to not allow Dispatch.com and ColumbusNow to further collect or use the child's information, that parent can email us to request that the information be deleted. Please send email to: [onlineeditors@dispatch.com.](mailto:onlineed@dispatch.com)

Non-subscribers to the print paper who pay $4.95 per month will be able to access the electronic edition as well as Dispatch.com.

[Click here for a preview](http://www.us.olive-soft.com/daily/client.asp?skin=Dispatch) of the electronic edition! You'll be asked to choose the dial-up version or the broadband version. Then you'll see the "A," or front section, of the newspaper from Sept. 10.
