### Who we may share your information with

This includes organisations such as Coles Group Limited and third party fulfillment contractors.

In all circumstances where your personal information is disclosed, Coles will ensure that these third parties undertake to protect your privacy. We will take all reasonable steps to store your personal information securely. In particular, we want you to feel confident in dealing with us on the internet.

Coles application forms use a process called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL locks all information passed from you to us in an encrypted envelope making it extremely difficult for this information to be intercepted.
