# Privacy Policy - Collective Bias

_Updated May 3, 2017_

  1. **The Short Version  **This website is presented by Collective Bias, Inc., an Inmar Company (“Collective Bias”).  Collective Bias cares deeply about your privacy, and wants you to understand how we collect and use information that relates to you.Our company assists in the creation of social media content. Our innovative programs gather personally identifiable information from individuals who choose to provide it, and gather non-personally identifiable and aggregated information about those who engage with the content we are involved with. Non-personally identifiable and aggregated information helps us to better understand how visitors to our websites and those of our affiliates engage with the content we are involved with, and to assess, improve, and quantify the response to such content.  We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information with our clients and affiliates.  We will only collect, store, and use any personally identifiable information (“PII”) you provide to us for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, and we strive to keep PII confidential.
  2. **Purpose of This Privacy Policy  **This Privacy Policy explains how we handle PII that you share with Collective Bias and the non-personally identifiable and aggregated information we gather. As explained in detail below, our Privacy Policy is designed to provide notice to individuals regarding how their information is being collected and used.  This Privacy Policy applies to all of the platforms owned or managed by Collective Bias and to which it is linked, including: Collective Bias (http://collectivebias.com/); Social Fabric (https://www.socialfabric.us/); Colectiva Latina (http://www.colectivalatina.com/); SoFab Food (http://www.sofabfood.com/); SoFab Chats (http://sofabchats.com); SoFab University (http://www.socialfabricuniversity.com/); and SoFab On the Road (http://ontheroad.socialfabric.us/)
  3. **Information Collection**
    1. Personally Identifiable Information Collective Bias collects PII ( _e.g._ , your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, demographic information, and information about your interest in and use of various products, programs and services, etc.) when you provide it to us.  PII collected by Collective Bias is maintained and used as set forth in this Privacy Policy. 
    2. PII Collected On Behalf Of Our Clients.  If PII is collected by Collective Bias on behalf of an identified client, such information belongs solely to the client and will be used solely in accordance with that client’s privacy policy.  Accordingly, we encourage you to review our clients’ privacy policies when submitting information for their use.  An individual’s desire to “opt-out” of receiving marketing or other information from a client will be handled in accordance with the client’s privacy policy. Collective Bias requests its clients to use the data that Collective Bias collects on its behalf in accordance with generally accepted privacy standards for both offline and online data, which includes an “opt-out” method for individuals who have provided PII.  Ultimately, however, Collective Bias is not responsible for data collected on behalf of its clients when such data is in its client’s possession.  
    3. Non-Personally Identifiable Information In addition to information you voluntarily provide to us, Collective Bias may collect on behalf of our clients and/or on our own behalf non-personally identifiable information (e.g., Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, device identifiers, “cookies,” browser information, Internet tags, and navigational data).  We do not attempt to associate such non-personally identifiable information with PII or with specific individuals.  
    4. Cookies. ”Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer’s hard drive or temporarily in your computer’s memory. The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and you will find them on most major web sites. Collective Bias may place and store Internet cookies on a user’s hard drive. The use of cookies provide benefits to you by saving user names, information that are supplied at registration, and other information that may make the use of our programs easier. Although most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, if you prefer, you can decline the placement of a cookie on your hard drive by using the appropriate feature(s) of your web browser software (if available) to delete the cookie. Please note, however, that certain areas on a web site may not function properly if your web browser does not accept cookies.
  4. **Sharing, Storage, and Retention of Personally Identifiable Information  **
    1. Sharing.  Collective Bias does not sell or rent PII to third parties, and shares PII with our clients only when the client has been identified to you.  Collective Bias does not otherwise disclose your PII to unaffiliated third parties, unless you have consented to such disclosure, Collective Bias in its sole discretion determines disclosure is necessary to protect Collective Bias, its clients, or other users of our websites and services, or such disclosure is required by law. Notwithstanding, Collective Bias does share PII with its corporate affiliates.
    2. Storage.  Collective Bias has measures in place to ensure that PII is safeguarded against loss and unauthorized access, use, modification, disclosure or other misuse.  Collective Bias stores all PII in a secured environment behind its “firewall.” Only those employees whose job responsibilities require them to use the PII are permitted access to such data. All employees sign confidentiality agreements and are not permitted to disclose any PII.
    3. Retention.  Collective Bias will retain your PII for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws.    If you have created a Member account on our website, you may request that the account be disabled, by contacting us via the website: [https://socialfabric.us/login](https://socialfabric.us/login).  You may also request that your Member account be deactivated, by contacting us via the website.  However, if you deactivate your account, it cannot be reinstated.    
  5. **Use of Personally Identifiable Information**  Collective Bias uses PII for the purposes for which it is submitted to us (e.g., to register individuals for our programs, send requested information, or identify interest in products or services referenced in the content we are involved with), and to communicate with individuals about our, and our clients’, programs and products.  You may opt out of receiving communications from us by updating your profile and/or preferences, if you have created a Member account or otherwise registered on our website, or by contacting us at community@collectivebias.com.  You may opt out of receiving communications from our clients that we have identified to you by following the “opt-out” procedures described in each client’s privacy policy.  
  6. **Sharing and Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information  **We use the non-personally identifiable and aggregated information we collect to better understand how visitors to our websites and those of our affiliates engage with the content we are involved with, and to assess, improve, and quantify the response to such content.  We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information with our clients and affiliates.  
  7. **Collection of Information by Third Parties and Links to Third-Party Websites.**  Our websites may serve ads from and/or link to the websites of third-parties.  Such third-parties may use automated methods to collect information about visitors to our websites.  For example, Amazon, in connection with special links displayed on our websites to enable you to purchase items from Amazon’s website, may monitor, record, use, and disclose information about our website and visitors to our website (e.g., that a particular Amazon customer clicked through a link from our site before buying a product on the Amazon site), and Amazon’s collection and use of such information will be in accordance with the [Amazon.com Privacy Notice](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html/ref=amb_link_353005802_18?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fhelp%2Fcustomer%2Fdisplay.html%2F%3Fie%3DUTF8%26nodeId%3D468496&token=3A0F170E7CEFE27BDC730D3D7344512BC1296B83&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=assoc-center-1&pf_rd_r=&pf_rd_t=501&pf_rd_p=&pf_rd_i=assoc_operating), not this Collective Bias Privacy Policy.   
  8. **Special Note About Children  **Unless otherwise specifically indicated, Collective Bias’s programs are not available to anyone under the age of thirteen (13).  We do not solicit PII from children, and no one under the age of thirteen (13) should submit PII to us.  If we discover that PII submitted to us pertains to a child under the age of thirteen (13), we will delete it.  
  9. **California Privacy Rights**
    1. Rights of Minors.  If you are a resident of the State of California and between the ages of thirteen (13) and eighteen (18), and have registered as a user of one or more of our websites or online services, you may request the removal of content or information you have posted that can be accessed by other users, by updating your profile and/or preferences, if you have created a Member account or otherwise registered on our website, or by contacting us at community@collectivebias.com.  Please note, however, that removal of content or information you have posted from our websites or services does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, particularly if the content or information you posted has been copied and/or reposted by a third party.
    2. California Customers  Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, a California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, unless the business adopts and discloses to the public a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes if the customer “opts out” of such communications. In that case, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost-free means to exercise that right.  Our cost-free “opt-out” procedure is described in Section 5, above.  If you use our “opt out” procedure, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. 
    3. Do Not Track Signals.  California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently isn’t an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don’t respond to them at this time.
  10. **Material Changes to Policy.  **Collective Bias may make material changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. Therefore, you should periodically visit this page to view the current Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our websites and any subsequent submission of PII to Collective Bias indicates your consent to the terms of our then-current Privacy Policy.  In the event of a material change to this Privacy Policy, Collective Bias shall send an email advising of the change to all persons whose email addresses we have collected and retained pursuant to the terms set forth above.
