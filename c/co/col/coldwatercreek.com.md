# Coldwater Creek ~ Privacy & Security

  
Trust is at the heart of every successful, ongoing relationship. At Coldwater Creek, earning and keeping your trust is the standard for everything we do. Because of this commitment, we never sell, rent or trade e-mail addresses with any other company. 

If you have any questions that are not answered below, please e-mail us at [customerservice@thecreek.com](https://web.archive.org/aspx/CustomerService/CSContactUs.aspx#Email).

  
**Do you sell or trade customer e-mail addresses?**   
No. We never sell, rent, or trade e-mail addresses.

We do occasionally share names and mailing addresses with other reliable companies. If you prefer that we not share your name or mailing address, please call 800-510-2808. Our customer service representatives are available daily from 6 a.m. to 3 a.m. ET.

**Does Coldwater Creek acquire names and addresses?**   
Yes. We may acquire names and addresses from third parties.

**What kind of information will I be asked to provide?**   
When you place an order, request e-mail updates, request a catalog, or participate in a promotion, contest or survey, we may ask for some or all of the following: your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. If placing an order, we may ask for credit card information. 

We maintain a record of your online, catalog and store purchases. If you ship your order to an address different from your billing address, we will ask you to enter the Ship To name and address. If you use Send-a-Hint, you will be asked for the e-mail address of the recipient. If you use Send-a-Hint or send an electronic gift card to someone, you will be asked for the e-mail address of the recipient. We never use these e-mail addresses for any other purpose.

**How will Coldwater Creek use the information I provide?**   
Your information is used to process and deliver your order to the address you request. Your payment information allows us to bill your credit card company. If we have any questions regarding your order, we will contact you by phone or e-mail. If you make a purchase, we may send you information and updates about new products, special sales and promotions. We use both e-mail and postal addresses to share information with our customers. When you supply e-mail addresses in Send-a-Hint or to send an electronic gift card, we use those addresses only for the purpose you intend. 

We often use testimonials from our customers in printed material or  
on our Web site, but only when we have express permission to do so. Testimonials come from customer comments sent or e-mailed  
directly to us. 

We occasionally share customer information with select third parties. From time to time we provide aggregate, statistical information about consumers and sales on our Web site and site shopping information. These statistics are used in communications, such as our annual report, and do not identify individuals.

**Do I need a password to order from Coldwatercreek.com?**   
No. However, you may find it more convenient if you sign up for an account with us. In your account we can store your name, address and credit card information so you don't have to enter that information during future shopping visits. Only the last four digits of your credit card numbers are displayed for easy identification.

**How do I update my personal information?**   
You can update your information online in [My Account](https://web.archive.org/aspx/MyAccount/MyAcctLogin.aspx). Log in with your  
e-mail address and password, then click Personal Information. Your account information will be displayed as we currently have it in our system. If you have any difficulties, click Instant Help or give us a call at  
800-510-2808. Our customer service representatives are available daily from 6 a.m. to 3 a.m. ET.

**Does Coldwatercreek.com use cookies?**   
Coldwatercreek.com does use cookies to make your shopping experience more efficient, convenient and personalized. Cookies  
are not required for you to browse our site, however, they are required for you to shop our site or to place an order. To learn more about cookies and how to enable them, [click](https://web.archive.org/aspx/CustomerService/CSSiteHelp.aspx#Browsers).

**How do I discontinue promotional e-mails?**   
At the bottom of each e-mail is information about removing your name from our e-mail list. You may also remove your name or change the frequency of the e-mails you receive in My Account. Log in with your  
e-mail address and password. Select E-mail & Password Information. On the next screen, make your selection, then save your changes. Our promotions are prepared in advance, so it may take a few days for the change to take effect, and you may receive e-mails during that time.

After you make a purchase, for your convenience we will still send e-mail order confirmations and information about your order. We may also contact  
you by phone or mail if we have questions regarding your order.

**How do I know Coldwatercreek.com is a secure site?**   
We use state-of-the-art technology to encrypt your personal and financial information before it is sent. The ordering area of our site is protected this way and is referred to as “secure.” You never have to worry when you send us your credit card information.

**Does Coldwatercreek.com use SSL technology?**   
Yes. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology is the gold standard in Internet encryption. This highly sophisticated system scrambles your financial data as it travels from your computer to our Web site, making it useless to anyone but Coldwatercreek.com.

**How do I know when I am in secure mode?**   
If you look at the Web site address in your browser window, non-secure sections of our site begin with “http://.” When you move to a secure area, the address changes to “https://”; the “s” means secure. You'll also see a lock displayed in the lower right-hand corner.

If for any reason you cannot access a secure area of our site to place your order, please call 800-510-2808. Our customer service representatives are available daily from 6 a.m. to 3 a.m. ET.

**What if an unauthorized purchase occurs?**   
We will cover any liability imposed on you by your bank or credit card company, up to $50, in the unlikely event that your card is used without your authorization at Coldwatercreek.com. We will also do whatever we can to help resolve the situation. The Fair Credit Billing Act requires your bank or credit card company to hold you responsible for no more than $50 of unauthorized or fraudulent charges on a credit card. Most debit card issuers voluntarily adopt the same liability limitations as credit card issuers, but you may want to check with your bank to make sure. Remember: if unauthorized use of your credit or debit card does occur,  
it is your responsibility to notify your card provider as stated in your agreement with them. 

**Is Instant Help a secure area of Coldwatercreek.com?**   
No. Instant Help is a chat-like feature on our site. It allows you to  
have questions answered online by one of our customer service representatives while you are shopping. It is not a secure area and, to protect your online security, a customer service representative will never ask you for credit card information during an online conversation in Instant Help.
