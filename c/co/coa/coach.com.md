# COACH: PRIVACY AND COOKIE NOTICE

Coach, Inc. and its affiliated companies (collectively, the "Company") collect certain information when you visit the websites we own in order to improve your experience and allow us to better communicate with you regarding our products and services. 

Visit our Global Privacy Page at <http://www.coach.com/globalprivacy.html> for a listing of country-specific privacy policies. If your country is not listed there, this privacy policy applies to the personal information we gather when you visit us and provide information to us through our Company websites (the “Sites”). This privacy policy also applies to the personal information you provide when you visit one of our retail locations operated by the Company or one of its subsidiaries, affiliates or distributors (“Retail Stores”) located in a country not listed on our Global Privacy Page – in such cases, we will also respect the local privacy and data protection laws in those countries. This privacy policy also applies to the information we may gather through social media or Company mobile apps. 

This policy covers how we use that collected information, and the safeguards we have in place to protect the information. This privacy policy applies to information received by the Company in connection with the Sites, and also covers personal information gathered at our Retail Stores that is transferred to or received by the Company in the United States by us or from our subsidiaries and affiliates in the EEA in any format including electronic, paper or verbal. By using and submitting information to our Sites or providing information at our Retail Stores, you are agreeing that we may collect, use and disclose the information we collect in accordance with the purposes and uses identified in this policy. For other terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Sites, please review our [Terms of Use](http://uk.coach.com/terms-of-use-uk.html).

## SAFE HARBOR AND PERSONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS

The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission agreed on a set of data protection principles (the "Safe Harbor Principles") to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the laws of the European Union ("EU") member states requiring that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EU to the United States. However, on October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued its decision in the case of Maximillian Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner which found the U.S. – EU Safe Harbor Framework to be invalid, affecting many companies that need to transfer personal data from EU member states to the United States and to other non-EU/EEA countries. While the Company continues to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles and has certified its compliance, in light of the suspension of the U.S. – EU Safe Harbor Framework, Coach has evaluated various other data transfer mechanisms and has decided to authorize these personal data transfers using European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (also referred to as Model Contracts). 

To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Company's certification, please visit [http://www.export.gov/safeharbor.](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor)

## INFORMATION WE COLLECT ONLINE

_Personal Information_

For purposes of this privacy policy, "personal information" means any information which identifies, or could be used to identify any individual, including name, address, telephone number, email address, billing and account information, credit or debit card information, and other information incidental to providing goods or services. While not personal information by itself, the Company also collects and retains certain browsing information described in more detail below, as well as information about purchases you make at Retail Stores, and, in the event that purchases are enabled on the Sites, regarding purchases on the Sites. For purposes of this policy, "personal information" shall not include anonymized information, aggregated information, or publically available information unless the same has been combined with non-public personal information.

We collect personal information from you on our Sites only when you voluntarily provide us with this information, such as when placing an order through the Sites or registering your Coach product on the Sites; establishing an account or adding information to your account such as by setting up a wish list, gift reminders, or address book entries; entering a contest or sweepstakes; taking a survey; contacting us with a comment or question; requesting a catalog; signing up to receive emails or text messages about our latest products and services; requesting to receive investor alerts; or applying for a job online.

Similarly, we collect information from you in our Retail Stores only when you voluntarily provide us with the information, such as purchasing our products, providing information about your Coach preferences, taking a survey or signing up to receive marketing information or applying for a job at a Retail Store. Your personal information in the form of images or video may also be captured in our retail stores that use CCTV. Such information is used for the purposes of theft prevention and public safety. You may contact us at the customer care email address provided below for more information on our personal information processing practices related to CCTV use in our stores.

_Browsing Information; Cookies_

When you visit the Sites, our web servers may automatically recognize certain non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your domain name, access provider, IP address, and browser language. The Sites also use a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique identification to your computer. The information collected from cookies allows us to provide better customer care to you and improve features of our Sites in a variety of ways, including by determining whether you have visited the Sites in the past and which pages of our Sites you have visited. Further, we use third party advertising companies to serve advertisements on other sites you may visit. To accomplish this, these companies may employ anonymous cookies and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness, track purchases on the Sites as a result of advertisements on a third party site, and understand your visits to our Sites and other web sites. If you do not wish to receive cookies from the Sites, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting a cookie and refuse the cookie when alerted by the browser. Cookies can also be refused by adjusting your browser settings accordingly. Please note that certain pages of the Sites may not function properly if cookies are turned off. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information about how to turn cookies on and off your browser.

We also may use a technology known as clear gifs to help us confirm your receipt of and response to our emails. If you wish to prevent further use of clear gifs in this manner, you can unsubscribe from our mailing list by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any Coach email that you receive, emailing us at [privacy@coach.com](mailto:privacy@coach.com) with your request to be removed from our email list, or changing your preferences in your Account. 

The Company also has chosen a company, Omniture, to assist us in understanding your use of the Sites. Omniture may place cookies on your computer to receive information about your browsing and, if applicable, buying activity on the Sites, and help us to provide you with a more personalized shopping experience.

  * if you submit a resume online or at our Retail Stores, we may use the information you provide solely for the purpose of evaluating you as a candidate for employment and to contact you about prospective employment.



In order to serve you better, we may combine information you provide to us on the Sites with information you provide to us in other ways, such as in our Retail Stores, and with information received from third parties including demographic or public information.

## HOW WE MAY SHARE INFORMATION

We may share your information collected on these Sites and in our Retail Stores with our subsidiaries or affiliated companies, including those located outside of your country. We also may share your information with selected third parties who provide services to us, including to process payments, provide electronic online investor information, monitor Site activity, serve Site content, help to maintain our customer database, administer emails, surveys, or contests and administer and maintain employment application information. Such third parties may have access to, store and process your personal information to provide services on our behalf, which may occur in the United States or in other countries. Our service providers are not authorized to use your information for any purpose other than to provide the contracted services. In any event, we will obtain assurances from these subsidiaries, affiliates and third parties that they will safeguard your personal information in a manner consistent with this privacy policy. We also must always reserve the right to disclose information about you as required by law, in response to legal process including law enforcement requests, and where needed to protect the safety, property, or legal rights of users of the Sites, or the Company or our subsidiaries or affiliates, or third parties.

Occasionally we may provide links to other websites which are not owned or operated by the Company and which you may access at your sole discretion. Please note that this privacy policy applies only to the personal data that we collect or receive on our Sites or in our Retail Stores and we cannot be responsible for personal data that third parties may collect, store and use through those third party websites for which we provide links. When you activate links to these third party sites, you will leave our Sites and we will have no control over, and accept no responsibility or liability in respect of, the privacy practices or the content of such websites, including (without limitation) any advertising, content, products, goods or other materials or services on or available from such third party websites. If you elect to provide your personal information on any third party website, the information will be subject to that website's privacy and security practices. You should consult the privacy and security notices of such third party website prior to providing any personal information. In the event that a third party website operator discloses your personal data to us, we will process such data in a manner consistent with this privacy policy.

In the unlikely event that the Company or substantially all of our assets are acquired by another company, or due to any merger, reorganization or liquidation, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. Your personal information will remain subject to any pre-existing privacy policy, unless you consent otherwise, and be processed in accordance with such policy. Except as described in this privacy policy, we will not share your personal information with third parties without your consent.

## VISITORS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE U.S.

Our website is maintained in the United States. This privacy policy governs the information collected at this website irrespective of where you're located when you access it, browse it and interact with it. This means your personal information may be stored outside of the province, state, and/or country in which you reside, and processed by us, an affiliate or a third-party service provider as described in this privacy policy. By using our Sites, you freely and specifically consent to such transfer of your personal information. Moreover, governmental bodies that have jurisdiction (e.g., courts and law enforcement agencies) may be entitled to access your personal information.

## CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

We do not knowingly request or collect personally identifiable information online from children or individuals considered minors under applicable law, particularly any individuals under the age of thirteen.

## SECURITY

We use certain security measures to protect the personal information you submit to the Site and at our Retail Stores. For example, when you provide any order information through our Sites, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, an encryption tool that provides security while transmitting this information over the Internet. We also use firewall technology, password controls, and other technological and procedural safeguards in maintaining the Sites and our databases. In addition, we have implemented administrative, technical and physical measures to address the confidentiality of personal information received from the Retail Stores. Although we have implemented the above security measures, you should be aware that 100% security is not possible.

## MANAGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION (YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES)

The Company shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, current, and relevant to the intended and authorized use. You may obtain upon request a summary of the personal information on record with us.
