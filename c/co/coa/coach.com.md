This privacy policy explains Coach’s information and data processing practices, as well as the choices you can make about the way your personal information or personally identifiable information (“PII”) is collected in our stores, on our social media platforms and via our Website, as well as the manner in which Coach will use your information.

By submitting your PII to Coach, you are agreeing that Coach may collect, store, use, disclose and destroy it in accordance with this policy. In this policy, we refer to the companies in our corporate group as "Coach", "we", or "us". We value every customer, prospective employee and employee and want you to trust our business and privacy practices. If you have any questions about the content of this policy, we encourage you to contact us as outlined below.

## Personal Information We Collect from You

For purposes of this policy "personal information" / “personally identifiable information” / “PII” means any information by which you can be identified, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, billing and account information, credit or debit card information, and other information incidental to providing goods or services.

We collect PII from you only when you voluntarily provide us with this information. Some examples of the manner in which we collect your PII include when you place an order through our Website or in our stores, register your Coach product after purchase, register an online account on the Website, set up a wish list, gift reminders, or address book entries, enter a contest, take a survey, contact us with a comment or question, request a catalog, sign up either online or in-store to receive emails or marketing communication about our Coach products and services, request to receive investor alerts, or apply for a job with Coach. Some of these methods of data collection are further outlined below.

## A. Website Registration

To register on our Website, you must complete the registration process by providing PII, such as your name, address, email, telephone number or mobile phone number, as well as information relating to what you would like to receive from us. If you choose to register, you will be asked to choose a user name and password. You have the right to unsubscribe at any time and the manner in which this can be done is explained further once you have accessed your account.

## B. Shopping with Coach

If you make a purchase from Coach, we obtain PII from you relating to the order. This may be done either online or in-store. The PII collected by Coach varies depending on the location and manner of your purchase, but it will generally include your billing, shipping and payment information. In addition to using this PII to fulfil your order, we also retain order information to better serve you on future purchases. Should you opt in to receive marketing communication from us we may also use this PII to contact you in connection with other Coach products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. Again, you may unsubscribe from marketing communication at any time. If you receive your marketing by email, each email will have a single click unsubscribe button at the bottom.

## C. Employment Applications

If you apply for a job with Coach, PII requested may include your qualifications for the position, your education, applicable licenses or certifications, prior job history, references, and any other information that you may choose to include about yourself. If you are accepted for employment, we will, of course, collect other relevant PII from you and include it in your personnel file with that collected during the application process. The PII that will be collected for purposes of your employment includes your Social Security number.

## D. Marketing Communications

If you choose to sign up for email communications either while browsing the Website or during one of your store visits, you must submit certain basic information during the registration process, this will include your name and email address. This PII is used to send you email marketing communications and to ensure that we can provide you with appropriate customer care and respond to your inquiries.

## E. Surveys

Coach retains this additional PII, if provided, and uses it to help us better understand and respond to the collective feedback we receive. We may also invite you to participate in a survey or poll such as providing feedback on our Website site content, services, or products. Your responses will be anonymous unless you choose to provide your contact details so that we can provide you with additional information regarding the survey or poll.

We are not responsible or liable for any content presented by or contained on any independent website, including, but not limited to, any advertising claims or marketing practices.

[www.coach.com](https://www.coach.com/) is primarily intended for residents of the U.S. If you happen to live in another country and use www.coach.com, any data collected about you with respect to your use of our Website will be transferred to the U.S. Please note that there may be different standards that apply to how your data is used and protected than the standards in place in your country.

## Promotions and Third Parties

From time to time, Coach may run promotions offering special deals, coupons, discounts, chances to win contests, and other prizes. These promotions may necessitate the involvement of third parties. In order to participate in these promotions, Coach may require certain basic information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, and age. This and other required information may be stored by Coach in order to help us better understand how we can design and market our products for you and others.

## Safe Harbor and Personal Information Transfers

Coach complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. However, on October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued its decision in the case of Maximillian Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner which found the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework to be invalid, affecting many companies that need to transfer personal data from EU member states to the United States and to other non-EU/EEA countries. While the Company continues to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles and has certified its compliance, in light of the suspension of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, Coach has evaluated various other data transfer mechanisms and has decided to authorize these personal data transfers using European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (also referred to as Model Contracts). To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view the Company's certification, please visit [https://www.export.gov/safeharbor.](https://www.export.gov/safeharbor)
