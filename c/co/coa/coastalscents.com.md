Coastal Scents: Privacy

**We respect your privacy!** Â   
  
Coastal Scents collects personal information when you subscribe to our Newsletter, create an account or when you make a purchase. However, we do not sell, rent or share any personal information you have provided with individuals or companies. All information collected on this site will be kept strictly confidential.

We do not store your credit card information on our server and/or keep them on file. Therefore, if you reorder, you will be asked for your credit card information again. Although some websites do offer express checkout and save your credit card information to your account, we chose not to offer this option to give our customers the best protection and security possible.

To be able to access your account, you must enter your email address and password. This is to establish your personal identity and respond with relevant account information. If there is a problem with your order, we may use your name and email address or phone number to contact you.

We may need to disclose user information in certain exceptional circumstances. This may be needed to protect against illegal hackers, our legal rights or to address actual or threatened illegal or harmful conduct. Disclosure may also be required by legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order.

You can access and manage your account information any time once logged in on our website. Certain information, such as name or address, can be updated or corrected.

Please note that in order to provide better functionality to our users, Coastalscents.com employs cookies, which are used to maintain your shopping cart status. Our credit card and payment processors may also collect information from you in order to be able to process your payments. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact our Customer Service Department.
