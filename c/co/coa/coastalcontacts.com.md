# Privacy Policy - Coastal.com

Essilor Group Canada Inc. ("Coastal", "we", "us", "our") respects your privacy and will at all times seek to comply with privacy laws. This privacy policy covers the site [www.coastal.com](https://www.coastal.com/). The personal information we collect about our users shall be carefully and adequately processed, and will not be disclosed, rented or sold to third parties other than described within this privacy policy.

We collect information to be able to process your order and to offer you our newsletter and special deals when it is time to refill your order (this will include your name, date of birth, email, postal addresses, encrypted credit card data information and details of any prescription supplied to you by your optician or medical practitioner). You will need to give your consent before any processing takes place and your personal data will only be used for the purposes stated in these terms and conditions and or at the point of collection. We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of personal data protection and will not collect information about you without your consent.

If you wish to refill your last order we will collect your email address and postal code and use the personal information and prescription information you have on file with in order to fulfill your request.

If you choose to use our referral service to invite a friend to our site or provide us referrals for job openings, we will ask for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

Or, if you provide your doctor's information, we will ask for your doctor's name and phone number, fax number (optional). We will use and store this information for the sole purpose of verifying your prescription.

Your friend or doctor may contact us at [privacy@coastal.com](mailto:privacy@coastal.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

Some pages may have the look and feel of being on [www.coastal.com](https://www.coastal.com/), however the information collected on these pages is not covered under this privacy policy. All information collected on the other domain is owned and controlled by a separate privacy policy.

This site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and read the privacy policy of each and every site that collects personal information. This privacy policy applies only to information collected by this site. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.

If Coastal is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information. We may also disclose your personal information to any other third-party with your prior consent.

We also use other third parties such as a shipping company to fulfill orders, a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services, provide customer service, and an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf. When you purchase items from us, we will share your personally identifiable information (PII) with the third-partsay, as necessary for the third-party to provide that service.

We, Coastal, and our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the website, tracking users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.

Our third-party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. These track the online movement of Web users. Instead of being stored on the user's hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period.

Atlas and Akamai may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide ads about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by the third-party, click here for Atlas and Akamai.

Coastal participates in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op to better understand how you use our website and apps across the various devices you use, and to deliver tailored promotions. [Learn more](https://cross-device-privacy.adobe.com/) about how Adobe does this.

### Security Policy

We take the security of your information very seriously. Our ecommerce system uses the latest SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) technology — the industry standard for encryption technology. It is used to create a secure transaction environment for commerce on the internet. If your browser and local network support the use of encrypted data transmissions, our Secure Checkout mode locks all information (i.e. your credit card number) passed from you to Coastal in an encrypted envelope, making it extremely difficult to be intercepted by an unauthorized party. SSL technology is compatible with Firefox, Chrome, and Microsoft Explorer and most other browsers. It is the same level of encryption technology that NASA and the CIA use. This ensures that your credit card information remains totally secure. It's about as secure as using your local bank machine.

### Service-related Announcements

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.

### Newsletters

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the Opt-Out section below.

### Opt-Out

We provide you the opportunity to opt-out of having your personal information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any special offer emails from us, you may opt-out at anytime by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each email communication. 

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter.

### Opt-In

Coastal is part of Essilor group. By accepting these terms and conditions, you (i) allow us to share your data strictly with companies within the Essilor group and (ii) give your express, specific and informed consent to receive emails of promotional materials concerning optical products and glasses from these companies. Your data will not be shared with any third party company. Each email sent to you by Coastal and/or other companies within our group will include an 'unsubscribe' link.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

If you have any questions about security on our website, you can email us at [privacy@coastal.com](mailto:privacy@coastal.com).
