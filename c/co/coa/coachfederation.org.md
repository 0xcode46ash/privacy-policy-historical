# Policies - About - ICF

## ICF Translation Policy

The International Coach Federation currently translates limited communications into English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. Microsites of Coachfederation.org, containing a limited version of Coachfederation.org, are also available.

ICF members may select a language in their member profile that they prefer to receive communications in from ICF Headquarters. Although all language options in the member profile menu are not currently supported, selecting a preferred language will assist ICF leaders and staff in regularly reviewing the language preferences of ICF's global membership.

Starting in April 2011, the number of items being translated into English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish will increase to include: select membership surveys and press releases and monthly member updates. Members must select a "primary language" in their ICF member profile in order to receive communications that are translated in a language other than English.

## Marketing Collateral Policy

The International Coach Federation marketing collateral policy is meant to assure sustainability, consistency, and to expand offerings, particularly translated items. The ICF provides digital files for marketing materials for ICF Chapter Leaders to use and print at their own leisure with local vendors. Only hosts of an official ICF Global Conference will be provided with printed collateral items (see marketing manual for ICF Global Conferences for details). This allows ICF staff to create additional excellent pieces that advocate for coaches. Items may not be changed or altered in any way.

*Small Chapters in need of resources are advised to contact ICF Headquarters at icfheadquarters@coachfederation.org.

## Spam Policy

All email and electronic communications with members should adhere to the following principles.

  2. A valid "from" and "reply to" address must be included with each message.
  3. If you have a subscription list, you should send a confirmation email that the person wishes to be on the list.
  4. There should always be a quick way to unsubscribe from any mail list.
  5. Any request to cease mailing from an individual or organization should be quickly honored.
  6. A complaint involving a breach of this policy may be considered a violation of the ICF Code of Ethics, and therefore referred to the Independent Review Board for their consideration.
