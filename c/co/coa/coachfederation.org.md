# Privacy Policy - Program Accreditation - ICF

**Scope:**  
This statement is designed to inform you of the International Coach Federation’s (ICF) ("us", "we", or "our") policy regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information we receive from program accreditation applicants (ACTP, ACSTH, and CCE). By submitting an application to ICF, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. ICF may disclose information received from program accreditation applicants where ICF reasonably believes that disclosure of such information is necessary to comply with law (including court and government orders, and civil subpoenas) or to ICF’s agents and advisors so that they may provide their services to ICF, and only under strict confidentiality restrictions.

**Information Collection, Use, and Sharing:**  
_Personal Information:_  
While applying for ICF program accreditation, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to maintain an uninterrupted stream of communication in order to provide pertinent updates regarding the ICF accreditation. Personally identifiable information may include but is not limited to (contact person's) name, address, telephone, or any other information deemed necessary to maintain communication. 

_Curricula & Course Content:_  
All information submitted is strictly for the purpose of assessing a program’s viability as an ICF accredited course. All course content and curricula collected by ICF is specifically utilized to assess a program’s content and alignment with ICF standards. The information is reviewed by ICF’s accreditation staff and not shared or utilized in any other capacity. (ACTP Applicants: Recordings that are provided by the applicant to assess the program’s output and subsequent alignment with ICF standards are reviewed by ICF contracted assessors and are not shared or utilized in any other capacity. Such applicant provided recordings become the property of ICF.)

_3 rd Party:_  
_JotForm:_ ICF collects a majority of its information for ICF accreditation through [_JotForm_](http://www.jotform.com/) _,_ a 3rd party application software and therefore data provided to ICF will be processed by this entity. Information collected by the _JotForm_ is governed by their [privacy policy](http://www.jotform.com/privacy/). 

_Dropbox:_ As a precautionary measure, ICF backs up and stores a majority of its information collected regarding ICF accreditation with [_Dropbox_](https://www.dropbox.com/), a 3rd party cloud storage company. Data provided to ICF will be stored on Dropbox’s cloud and therefore is governed by their [privacy policy](https://www.dropbox.com/terms#privacy). 

_ICF exercises no control over these third party sites and their privacy practices._

**Security:**  
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page. While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy:**  
The International Coach Federation (ICF) may update this Program Application Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

This Program Application Privacy Policy and privacy practices of ICF will be subject exclusively to the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky within the United States. ICF makes no representations that this Policy and its practices comply with the laws of any other country.
