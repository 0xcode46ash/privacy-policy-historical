#### Information Sharing

We will share Your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement and as may be further described at the time that You provide the requested information.

We do not sell Your personal information to third parties, however, we will provide it to third parties who need the information to process Your orders, conduct criminal background, sex offender or other checks on a Member’s credentials or personal history (“Background Checks”) or to provide services (such as for payment processing in connection with Your Membership). Any such third parties will only use Your personally identifiable information in connection with the fulfillment of Services or to perform Background Checks, or in connection with the disclosure of the results of such Background Checks as authorized by Your acceptance of our Terms, or to communicate with You about the Services.

Without limiting any other provision of this Policy or our Terms, we may share (and You expressly authorize us to share): Your personal information with third-party verification service providers for the purpose of performing Background Checks that You authorize when You sign up for our Services. You also expressly authorize us to release the results of any Background Checks that we obtain relating to You with any other Member who has requested said data in connection with the Services. In particular, we reserve the right to share, and You expressly authorize us to share the results of Your Background Check with, if You are a Coach, any other Member who has engaged You for coaching services, and if You are a Coach Seeker, with any Coach who has provided or agreed to provide You or a Minor Athlete with coaching services. You may decide not to grant permission for Background Checks, or to rescind permission to do so, but if You do, CoachUp may immediately terminate Your membership without further obligation of any kind.

**Because Background Checks are from third party providers, CoachUp disclaims all responsibility and liability for the results of said Background Checks.**

Furthermore, we may also disclose Your personal information as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect Your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. We also reserve the right, if CoachUp is involved in, to disclose any information You have provided to a third party who acquires CoachUp via a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets. In such case, You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of Your personal information, as well as any choices You may have regarding Your personal information, to any other third party with Your prior consent to do so.
