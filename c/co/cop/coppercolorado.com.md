Security

Copper Mountain has gone to great lengths to ensure the security of your credit card and other booking information. The security measures we use include a firewall, encryption, and timed logouts.

The firewall is a combination of hardware and software that securely separates the Internet from our organization's internal web servers. They are designed to prevent unauthorized access to our web servers.

Encryption is used whenever financial information, customer identification and passwords are transmitted. We use an encryption tool called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). It scrambles your information into an unreadable format called cyphertext, so that even if a third party were to intercept the message, the data would be unreadable. When we receive your cyphertext, it is decrypted using a mathematical key, so that we can process it.

Timed logouts have been set up in some areas of our site. Should you be called away from your computer and neglect to log off, you don't want someone else to sit down at your keyboard and access your secure session with us. Timed logout occurs after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if you're working on a booking and need to leave the computer, you should save your itinerary first so that you don't lose the data you've already entered.

In addition to the technically driven security measures, we also follow internal privacy procedures. In most cases our employees will see personal information only in aggregate - for instance, they'll see the total number of rooms booked for a specific date, not the room you've booked. Employees see only those data they need to complete your booking.

In a few areas on our Web site, we ask you to provide information that will enable us to enhance your site visit, process your order correctly, and if necessary, follow up with you before or after your visit. For instance, we want your e-mail address or phone number so that we can contact you if, due to unforeseen circumstances (flood, fire, storm, avalanche) we need to rebook you into another room.

From time to time we may ask questions, or we may use data collected for order processing, to better understand our customers' preferences. This information allows us to improve our products and services, and to offer you specially tailored deals when appropriate. While some of this information is optional, other items (e.g., information required to process an order) are not.

We will request information from you when you: 

  1. Register as a member on Copper Mountain's website. 
  2. Plan a trip to Copper Mountain 
  3. Place an order with Copper Mountain 
  4. Provide feedback in an online survey 
  5. Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer 
  6. Subscribe to a newsletter or a mailing list 

In each of these instances, we may ask for any of the following types of information: name, e-mail address, phone number, address, customer and trip preference information, customer ID and password, as well as other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers. If you don't want to receive promotional material or special offers from us, we ask that you tell us this in the section on communications preferences (opt out by un-checking the appropriate boxes). Please note that in the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time. Furthermore, if you need to change your profile and/or preferences, due (for instance) to a change of address, you will be able to make the change at any time.

Depending on how you configure your browser, when you visit copper.intrawest.net (our online booking engine) a small file (a "cookie") is stored on your hard drive. Whenever you log onto copper.intrawest.net our server looks for your cookie, and that's how we recognize that you've visited the site before and don't need to re-enter your personal information. Your browser can be configured to reject cookies, but if you do this you'll have to re-enter your address and billing information each time you use our on-line booking pages.

Copper Mountain does not allow companies with a banner on our site to automatically store a cookie on your browser when you visit our site. They can only store a cookie if you link through to their site.

Different information will be used for different purposes. Some personal information is required to process your order. For instance. we need to know your correct age, height, weight, foot size, skill level and gender so that we can set up rental equipment before you arrive.

We may also use personal account information to generate statistics and aggregate reports for internal use and for sharing with affiliates. These statistics and aggregate reports will not contain any personally identifiable information. Your identity is kept anonymous.

Aggregate information may be used to design programs and promotions that we think would be of interest to an identified group of customers. For example, if an analysis of purchase data shows that 30% of our guests are intermediate skiers who rent equipment, we may want to develop a special rental/lesson program for them to test new gear.

In addition we may use the detailed profiles in order to target special offers and promotions more effectively. Knowing more about you allows us to personalize the delivery of site content to you (at this time personalized content delivery will be via email) should you wish to receive offers from us. If we decide to use information collected for any purposes other than those identified we will contact you for your agreement.

Knowing more about you allows us to personalize the types of information we send to you. This means that you will probably receive less mail from us (unless of course you tell us you want everything), and what you do receive will be meaningful and not filled with a whole lot of information that does not apply to you.

We do not and will not sell or rent users information to any entity outside of Intrawest Corp.

Please remember that anything posted on our message boards becomes public information and you should exercise caution about disclosing personal information on those pages.

Copper Mountain and our parent company, Intrawest, reserve the right to cooperate with local, provincial, federal, and international officials in any investigation requiring either personal information (including any information provided on-line through copper.intrawest.net) or reports about lawful of unlawful user activity on this site.

Copper Mountain and Intrawest also reserve the right to disclose any information in an individual's account: 

  1. To satisfy any law, regulation, or government request 
  2. If such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to site operation 
  3. To protect the rights or property of copper.intrawest.net and its users, sponsors, providers, licensers, or merchants 

copper.intrawest.net also reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time.

Should you not want to receive promotional material from us we ask that you tell us in the section on communications preferences (opt out by un-checking the appropriate boxes).

We will also delete your name from the database upon your written request sent to us via email. When you register and your account is created, we will confirm your registration by sending an email to the address that you supplied to us. All future emails to your account will contain information on how to delete your name from our database. Please keep this email and follow the instructions exactly when requesting that your name be deleted from our database.

Copper Mountain and Intrawest reserve the right to decide if they will contact customers should we be required to disclose any personal information (as outlined in non-use and disclosure).

Copper Mountain and Intrawest do not knowingly solicit data from, or about, people under the age of 16 years for the purposes of selling directly to these individuals. Note: Copper Mountain and Intrawest assume that visitors to our site are adults. We do not require any visitor to provide date of birth at registration, though we do ask for an age or birth date when applicable for pricing purposes (for instance, children and seniors qualify for discounts on lift tickets). U.S. federal law prohibits discrimination in public accommodations based on age, so when we send out information on lodging bookings we are required to treat all site members equally, regardless of age. We will send real estate offers only to customers 21 years old and older.

Under no circumstances, including, but not limited to, negligence, shall Copper Mountain or Intrawest be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, including, but not limited to, loss of data or profit, arising out of the use, or the inability to use, the materials on this site, even if Copper Mountain/ Intrawest or a Copper Mountain/ Intrawest authorized representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
