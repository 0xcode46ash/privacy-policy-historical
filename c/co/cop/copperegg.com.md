COPPEREGG, INC.  
PRIVACY POLICY  
(REVISED APRIL 2011)

CopperEgg, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“CopperEgg,” “our,” “us,” or “we”) respects your privacy. In that regard, we have created this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect when you visit our website located at copperegg.com (including any forums, the “Website”), or use our proprietary service or such other features, websites or applications offered from time to time (collectively, the “Service”), why we collect it, and how it is used. By using the Website or Service, you consent to the data practices prescribed in this Privacy Policy.

“Personal Information” means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number, or other contact information, whether at work or at home, age information, credit or debit card information. We may ask you to provide Personal Information that will enable us to enhance your use of the Service, or for purposes such as facilitating correspondence with you, registering your entitlement to access certain special features, or to complete transactions. It is always your choice whether or not to provide that Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Service.

Technical Information. We may collect and use technical data and related informationâ€”including but not limited to technical information about your device(s), system and application software, and peripheralsâ€”that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Service. We may also automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, which could include your IP address, cookie information, browser information, and the page you request. This information is not deemed by CopperEgg to constitute Personal Information and while CopperEgg will not use it in a way that associates such information with you, such information it may be aggregated and used. CopperEgg owns this information and may use it in any manner it deems appropriate.

The Personal Information that you provide will be kept confidential. It will be used to process transactions and to support your relationship with CopperEgg and use our products and services. Among other things, we want to help you quickly find information through our Service, leverage our tools in connection with your authorized use of our products and services, and alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new products and services from CopperEgg.

Except as set forth herein or in a separate agreement between you and CopperEgg (including any Analytics Service Agreement or any software license agreement), CopperEgg does not rent, sell or share Personal Information it collects about you to or with third parties, and Personal Information collected from you is only used to provide you with CopperEgg products and services and to comply with any requirements of law.

Agents or contractors of CopperEgg may have access to your Personal Information on a need to know basis for the purpose of performing services on behalf of CopperEgg. All such agents or contractors who have access to such information are required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for CopperEgg or as otherwise required by law. We internally audit our business practices and procedures, examining confidentiality standards and information access in order to protect your Personal Information.

CopperEgg or its agents or contractors may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of CopperEgg or its agents or contractors; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public.

Finally, if CopperEgg should ever merge with another organization, file for bankruptcy, or sell our assets, we may transfer the information you provide to us on through the Service to a third party or share your Personal Information to the company with which we enter into such transaction as a part of such transaction.

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect Personal Information.

Our system is also designed to protect Personal Information from unauthorized usage on shared computers in that users are required to log in through CopperEgg’s Service.

Despite the actions and precautions we take, no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of your Personal Information and you transmit it to us at your own risk.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose Personal Information on our message boards or other public forums or features or through e-mail, or in chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting Personal Information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any Personal Information you choose to submit in connection with these public features.

We may send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in the event of a known security breach. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at support@copperegg.com.

Please be aware that other websites and services, including the websites of third parties that you connect with through our Service, may collect personally identifiable information about you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of those third-party websites, services or applications. Further, our Service may employ third party technologies that require you to accept such third party’s terms. This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of those third-party technologies.

Personal Information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which CopperEgg or its affiliates, subsidiaries, agents or contractors maintain facilities, and by using the Service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

By using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version.

We may change this Privacy Policy by posting a new version of this Privacy Policy on our Website or through the Service, and it is your responsibility to review this policy periodically.
