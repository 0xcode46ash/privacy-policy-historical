Cookies
    •    We may place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer. The cookie
         itself does not contain personal information although it will enable us to relate your use of this
         website to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal

         administrative messages without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them
00020547                                                 2

    •    Copart UK may store your account information active in our databases indefinitely following the
         termination of your account with Copart UK to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Confidentiality and Security
    •    We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need
         to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do
         their jobs.
    •    We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to
         protect personal information about you.
    •    If Copart UK learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so
         that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this website or providing personal
         information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security,
         privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this website. Copart UK may post a
         notice on our website if a security breach occurs. Copart UK may also send an email to you at the
         email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you
         may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written
         notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you
         should notify us at privacy@copart.uk.com.
    •    Copart UK takes your security seriously and takes reasonable steps to protect your information.
         No data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be
         100% secure. The following is a summary of the measures Copart UK takes to protect your
         information and descriptions of ways we implement these measures for different types of
         information you may provide to us:
             o Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
                 Copart UK uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption when transmitting certain kinds of
                 information, such as financial services information or payment information. An icon
                 resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most browsers window during SSL
                 transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. Any time Copart UK
                 asks you for a credit card number for payment or for verification purposes, it will be SSL
                 encrypted. The information you provide will be stored securely on our servers. Once you
                 choose to store or enter your credit card number on Copart UK, it will not be displayed
                 back to you in its entirety when you retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire
                 number, you will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of
                 your number.
             o Vendors and Partners
                 Copart UK works with vendors and partners to protect the security and privacy of user
                 information.
             o Employee and Contractor Access to Information
                 Copart UK limits access to personal information about you to those employees who we
                 reasonably believe need to come into contact with that information to provide products or
                 services to you or in order to do their jobs.
             o Education and Training for Employees
                 Copart UK has implemented a company-wide education and training program about
                 security that is required of every Copart UK employee.

         consent before implementing the change. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy
         Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the Personal Information we collect. Your
