**ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY** Â 

**Introduction**  
By using the copyright.com Web site or any other CCC Web site, you agree to the terms of the CCC Online Privacy Policy, as outlined below. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use these sites.

**Collection of Personal Information**  
You may access and read most of our Web sites without giving us any information that identifies you. However, when you engage in certain activities on these Web sites, such as seeking and receiving permissions, authorizations or licenses to use the copyrighted works of the copyright rightsholders CCC represents, CCC may ask you to provide certain information about yourself and/or your organization by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to fill out the form and/or engage in these activities. Should you choose not to do so, however, it may be impossible for CCC to provide the license that you are seeking. On the other hand, should you do so, CCC may require that you provide us with personal information, such as your name, organization name, mailing address, e-mail address and other identifying information. Further, should you choose to use a credit or debit card to pay CCC, you may be asked to provide a card number, expiration date and name of cardholder.

CCC collects this information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. For example, CCC may use the information that you provide in order to verify the details of any license issued to you or in order to keep you informed about CCC products and services. Among other things, CCC uses the information in accordance with its obligations to participating rightsholders to identify uses of copyrighted materials provided by those rightsholders, which obligations vary from CCC program to program. Details about such obligations under any particular CCC program are available from CCC upon request. CCC does not, however, share information with rightsholders (i) about individuals within CCC's organizational customers, (ii) about credit or debit card details, or (iii) about the use of OTHER rightsholders' copyrighted materials. 

CCC recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of this information. Therefore, except as disclosed above, we do not release or sell lists of our customer names to any outside organization. Further, your personal information is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access to it. This password is encrypted; we recommend that you not disclose your password to anyone. Finally, when you submit personal information to CCC, you understand and agree that CCC and its subsidiaries, affiliates and trusted vendors may transfer, store and process your customer profile in any country in which we do business, including but not limited to the United States.

Please be advised that CCC is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any other Web site to which copyright.com or any other CCC Web site may link. 

**Use of Cookies**  
When you visit copyright.com, or any other CCC Web site, you can surf the site anonymously and read important information without revealing your identity. In order to improve our sites we use "cookies" to track your visit. A cookie is a small string of data that is transferred to your browser from a Web site and can only be read by the Web site that gave it to you. It acts as an identification card, recording your passwords and preferences (if you have identified yourself to the Web site) and possibly your license status. It cannot be executed as software code or deliver viruses. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. Copyright.com does not presently include any Web pages that are inaccessible without a cookie, but CCC reserves the right to create such pages, in which case you will be given the option to accept the cookie necessary for such access. While CCC uses cookies to track your visit to any CCC Web site, and, as part of the ordinary operation of the Internet our computers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, this information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous unless you have otherwise provided CCC with personal information. 

**Changing Our Records of Your Personal Information**   
You have the right to correct your personal information. This may be accomplished either by writing to CCC at: Copyright Clearance Center, Inc., Business Operations Department, 222 Rosewood Drive, Danvers, MA 01923, USA (or our e-mail address info@copyright.com). Please include your name, address and/or e-mail address when you contact us and please be specific about your request.
