Frequently Asked Questions

**What are your shipping policies and procedures?** Please see our [shipping](https://www.cottonbabies.com/shipping.php) information for details on shipping. 

**What is your return and exchange policy?**  


This information is important. Please read this entire page before sending your return/exchange.

__Return Policy__  
Cotton Babies will gladly refund your money less a 10% restocking fee for products that are returned in the original, undamaged package and in resaleable-as-new condition within 30 days of purchase. Washed, used & clearance items are non-returnable. Packages must be returned complete, _including_ free items. Exchanges may be made without incurring a restocking fee as long as no refund is necessary. Unless we made a mistake with your order, you are responsible for return or exchange shipping charges. An [RMA number](https://www.cottonbabies.com/returns.php) is required for all returns.

**All return/exchange requests must include the following information:**

  1. A return merchandise authorization number written on the outside of the package ([click here to get your number](https://www.cottonbabies.com/returns.php)). After this form is completed, you will be emailed an authorization number that should be written on the outside of your package. You can check the status of the return online by going to the same url (<http://www.cottonbabies.com/returns.php>) and entering the authorization number and your zip code. We will update the status of your return in the system when we receive the package and again when it is processed. 
  2. A separate note in the package with the following information: name, current mailing address, products included in your package, the reason for the request and what you would like us to do. 
  3. The address to use when shipping your returns is available after you have completed the [request for an RMA number](https://www.cottonbabies.com/returns.php). 



**_Defective Merchandise_**  
Defective products are usually exchanged or repaired by the product manufacturer. If you are not sure how to contact the manufacturer of the product you purchased, please [contact us](http://www.cottonbabies.com/contact_us.php). If you are returning a defective product, you must be considerate about the condition of your item before shipping your item. _Your item must be clean, stain-free and dry before you ship it._ Without exception, we will not handle any items that are stained, smelly or damp on arrival. If the diapers stink, they will be returned to you at your expense. To be sure that your diapers are in acceptable condition, inspect carefully for staining and smell the diaper. If you smell anything "off", wash it again with 1/4 cup of bleach. Rinse well. Dry it on medium in the dryer. Repeat this process as needed until the diaper meets our return standards. 

Please note, we are not responsible for damage to an item caused by improper care, abuse, misuse, normal fading or normal "wear and tear" of the product materials. Diapers are not made of steel and, like any other clothing item, they may not withstand washing every single day for extended periods of time. Please keep this in mind as you decide how many diapers to purchase. We're here to help if you need it. 

**Privacy**  
We value your privacy. Your personal information (including your email address, street address, phone number, and order history) will not be sold to any individual or company outside of Cotton Babies for any reason (unless required by a court of law).
