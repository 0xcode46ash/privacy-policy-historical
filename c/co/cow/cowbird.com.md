The stories, sounds, images, and other media content (“Content”) that you submit for inclusion in Cowbird may reveal personal information about you and the subjects of that Content. We ask that you obtain permission from others and that you carefully consider the information that you want to disclose about yourself and others in the public forum that Cowbird provides. Please be thoughtful and decent. Once you choose to share Content through Cowbird, that Content could potentially be copied and reshared by others with access to Cowbird. 

Cowbird automatically receives and records information from your computer/mobile device and browser, including your IP address/device ID, cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request. Cowbird may set and access Cowbird cookies on your computer. Cowbird may use web beacons and other technologies to track your use of Cowbird. 

It is possible that others may submit Content that provides links to sites and services outside of Cowbird, and this privacy policy does not apply to such third party sites and services. Additionally, some of the services included on Cowbird are delivered or served by third-party companies that may place or recognize cookies, web beacons or other technology to track certain information about our Web site users. For example, we may include in Cowbird certain integrations with third-party social networks. In the course of serving certain third-party social network functionality on Cowbird, some third-party social network operators may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of Cowbird. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads based on your interests on other Web sites.
