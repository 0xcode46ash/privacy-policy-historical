# Cobb County Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**  
This computer system is for the use of Cobb County Government for the purpose of providing services and information via the Internet. Unauthorized access or access which exceeds authorized access is punishable by law. 

**We want to make it clear that we will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, or as otherwise required by law, we do not share any information we receive with any outside parties.**

**How we handle the information we gather when you visit our Web site:**

We collect and store only the following information about you:  
• The name of the domain from which you access the Internet (i.e., aol.com, if you are connecting from an AOL account)   
• The date and time you access our site   
• The item you requested from the server   
• The Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site 

If your browser accepts cookies, we may use a cookie to determine if you are a repeat or new visitor or to understand how many different visitors come to our sites. When we examine this data, it is always presented in an aggregate form. Except in the case of actual law enforcement investigations, we do not track or look at individuals' usage behavior.

**What is a cookie?**  
A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser -- along with a web page -- when you access a Web site. There are two kinds of cookies. A session cookie is a line of text that is stored temporarily in your computer's RAM. Because a session cookie is never written to a drive, it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser. A persistent cookie is a more permanent line of text that gets saved by your browser to a file on your hard drive. Some cookies we use are persistent and some are session only. If you have your browser set to notify you before accepting cookies, the notice will tell you if the cookie expires some time in the future or not. Persistent cookies have an expiration date in the future. Session cookies have no date associated with them.

**Our use of Cookies**  
We use this information to create summary statistics which are used for Web site planning and maintenance and to analyze system performance. This information tells us the number of visitors to the different sections of our site and helps us understand if our site is meeting the needs of our visitors. This information is only presented in an aggregate form--never for an individual user. Other potential uses of cookies on our web servers are to provide functionality for Web-based applications, or connecting a shopping cart on our eGov site. Beyond these uses for cookies on Cobb County Web sites, we do not share any cookie information with any third party.

**If you identify yourself by sending an email or completing a form  
**When you send us personally identifying information (e.g., in an electronic mail message containing a question or comment, or by filling out a form that emails us this information), we use this information to respond to your request. Electronic forms submitted to Cobb County include the Internet Protocol (I.P.) address assigned to you by your Internet service provider.  We may also forward your email to other Government employees, who are better able to answer you questions.

**Links to other sites**  
The documents posted on this Web site may contain hypertext links or pointers to information created and maintained by other public and private organizations as provided by Communications Office policy. These links and pointers are provided for visitors' convenience. Cobb County Government does not control or guarantee the accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of any linked information from non-Cobb County Government sites.

**Security**  
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, Cobb County web servers employ industry-standard methods to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on Cobb County servers are strictly prohibited and may be punishable by law.

In the specific context of this security monitoring, there is no expectation of privacy. However, only in the case of actual law enforcement investigations, will we attempt to identify individual users or their usage habits.

If you have any questions about these policies, [contact us](mailto:webmaster@cobbcounty.org).
