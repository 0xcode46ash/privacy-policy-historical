**PRIVACY POLICY**

Welcome to the Cobra Golf Internet site (this "Site"). Acushnet Company wants you to know what information we learn about you when you visit this Site, what we do with that information, and how you can change the information we have. 

When you visit this Site, we recognize only your domain name and not your e-mail address. We will see your e-mail address only if you fill out a form or send us an e-mail message. 

If you provide information about yourself by registering on a page, by filling out a survey, by participating in our chat rooms or otherwise by voluntarily telling us about yourself or your activities, we will collect that information for our own use to improve our products and services and the content of this Site. 

We may also use it to send you information. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please let us know by sending an e-mail message to us at: webmaster@cobragolf.com telling us that you do not want to receive e-mail from our company. 

From time to time, we may also share your information for marketing and promotional purposes with reputable companies that we have pre-screened and whose products we think you may find interesting. If you do not wish to have your information shared with other companies, please send us an e-mail or letter with your exact name and address and your request to have your name placed on our "Do not share" list. 

**COOKIES:** When you visit this Site, we may leave a "cookie" in the memory of your Web browser. Cookies are very small files that store information about your visit to and use of this Site. Most major commercial Internet sites use them and they make your Internet-surfing more useful and less time-consuming for you because they store information that is reusable each time you visit this Site, such as passwords and your preferences including information you have chosen to share with us. Cookies cannot access and read the files on your hard drive and cannot be used as a virus. They do allow us to provide information and products that are more meaningful to you without asking you the same questions every time you visit us. We hope you will want the better service that cookies allow, but if you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, if you do that, some parts of this Site and other sites may not work as well. 

Acushnet Company reserves the right to change or update this policy at any time by posting a notice to that effect on this Site.
