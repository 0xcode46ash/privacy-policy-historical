Except where necessary in connection with services provided by appropriate intermediaries, who will be required to comply with the confidentiality provisions of this policy, Wiley will not disclose any personal information identifying Users to any third party, unless required by law or to enforce the **Wiley Online Library** [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/termsAndConditions) or otherwise needed in connection with legal proceedings or unless we have received your consent.

If use of an electronic product, feature or service offered by Wiley on this website requires a User to provide a name and password or other personally identifiable information, the User will have the option to opt in or out of providing such information and using the product, feature or service. Any private communications or information supplied to Wiley by a User may be used by Wiley for internal business and research purposes and to help enhance and develop our websites but will not be shared with third parties unless we receive your consent.

In using such links, Users should be aware that each third party website will vary in terms of its privacy and data protection policies, and Wiley does not take responsibility for the privacy policies of, and usage of, personal information collected by others including, without limitation, those of any partner or affiliate.

## Additional Services

In addition **Wiley Online Library** may offer additional services, including optional _E-mail Alerting Services_ , which are opted into by registration and may be opted out of at any time. By choosing to take advantage of this and other services offered by **Wiley Online Library** , you consent to the use of your information for the purposes of providing these services.

## Use of Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of information that a website puts on a hard drive so that it can remember information about a user at a later date. In **Wiley Online Library** cookies are used in two ways: as a temporary, Session Control cookie to validate access privileges and – at the user's option – as a permanent cookie to facilitate login to **Wiley Online Library** via the Remember Me option. Cookies are not used to gather or provide usage statistics. By choosing to take advantage of these services, you consent to the use of your information for the purposes of providing these services.

## Session Control Cookie

Session control cookies are used on most Web sites today because they facilitate navigation. In order to use **Wiley Online Library** users must have their browsers set to accept cookies.

Once a user is signed onto **Wiley online library** , our Web server uses a temporary cookie to help us manage the visit to the service. _This Session Control Cookie is deleted when the user quits the browser_. This cookie allows us to quickly determine access control rights and personal preferences during the online session. The Session Control Cookie is set out of necessity and not out of convenience.

## Remember Me Cookie

When a user registers to gain access to **Wiley Online Library** or its personalization features, whether as a Guest User or as an Authorized User from a subscribing institution, he is asked to choose a user name and password. Every time the user logs into **Wiley Online Library** , he/she will be asked to enter this unique user name and password. Users have the option of storing this information on their computers as a permanent cookie by selecting the "Remember Me" option when logging in. _This feature is optional and user controlled. The Remember Me cookie can be deleted at any time by unchecking the Remember Me checkbox in_ **Wiley Online Library**.

Users must be careful not to store their user name and password as a cookie on any computer that is not their own, since doing so would enable other users coming to that computer to access **Wiley Online Library** under their name and to have access to their **Wiley Online Library** My Profile page.
