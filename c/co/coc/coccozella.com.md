# Cocco - Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy: 

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 

Information pertaining to the purchase of subscriptions by credit card or bank payments is not collected by us but rather is retained only the particular processor (eg, CCBill, iBill, Verotel, etc). For their privacy policies please consult their websites; however we can provide reasonable assurance that extremely high standards of security of information are maintained by these reputable companies and that they only use your personal information for the purpose of concluding a particular transaction. We are able to access that information but do so only to assist customers with their own accounts and do not retain a record in our own databases. 

Customer information pertaining to the purchase of tangible goods such as videotapes is entered into our local database for the purpose of tracking and shipping orders. We DO NOT use or keep a record of credit card account numbers. Our database, which primarily holds names and addresses is on a password-protected computer in secure, locked facilities with authorized-personel-only access. 

We do not share or sell our customer information with anyone whatsoever. We do not utilize recorded email addresses to send out unsolicited emails of any nature. We only contact customers individually should the need arise. 

We have an email newsletter that is sent out once every 2 weeks from a list collected by voluntary sign-up only. This list does not relate in any manner with our sales lists. The Newsletter list only records a particular email address and only the person in control of that email address can sign up for the newsletter. Being removed from the list is simple, however we will also do this for anyone who requests it. 

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please send us an email at:
