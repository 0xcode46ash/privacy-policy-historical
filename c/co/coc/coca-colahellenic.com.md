We provide this Privacy and Cookie Notice to help you to understand what we may do with any personal information that we obtain from you.

## What is personal information? 

Personal information is information about an identifiable individual, as defined by applicable law, such as name, e-mail address and telephone number. 

## Information that we collect from you 

In general, you can visit this website without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. In addition, there are parts of this website where we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information you request and where requested to register you to our website. 

We do this through the use of online forms and every time you e-mail us your details. The information collected from you may include your name, address, telephone, fax number, or e-mail address. You will find that it is not compulsory to provide us with any additional information we request which is not necessary or reasonable in order to provide you with the services you have requested. We may also collect information about you from e-mails or letters you send to us. 

## Use of information collected 

Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our site and to improve its content. 

When other personal information, such as your name and e-mail address, is collected from you with your consent (for example, through the use of on-line forms or via e-mail) we generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use that personal information. We may also use the personal information you provide or which we collect via this website for the purposes of: 

  * Providing any services that you have requested from us such as to receive Investor Relations information/copies of our Annual Reports, to subscribe to the corporate web-cast service or to subscribe to our e-mail alert service. 
  * Responding to your inquiries or to process your requests in relation to your information. 
  * Providing and personalising our services. 
  * Administering subscription-service records. 



If you change your mind about being contacted in the future, please let us know.
