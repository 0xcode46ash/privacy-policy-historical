# Privacy Policy | Coconuts Bangkok

Welcome to Coconuts, the online and mobile service of Coconuts Media Limited (“Coconuts,” “we,” or “us”). Coconuts respects your privacy and your data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.

**1.   WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS**

This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) gathered when you are using or accessing Coconuts. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.

  
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through Coconuts or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in our [Terms of Use](http://bleacherreport.com/pages/terms).

**2.   HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION**

The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate Coconuts. In connection with certain aspects of Coconuts, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect the following types of information about you:

**a. Information you provide us directly:** When you register for a Coconuts account or correspond with us, we ask for certain information, such as your first name, last name, and e-mail address. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an account on the Service and providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not be anonymous. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service, including written comments and posts from your blog. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, and as further detailed below.

**b. Information we may receive from third parties:** We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Twitter or Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the Coconuts application, linking your account to the Coconuts service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Coconuts. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service, including your public profile picture, news feed, posts on your wall (including your friends’ posts on your wall), friends list, etc. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Coconuts Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.

**c. Analytics information:** We may directly collect or use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device as part of a web page request, including the web pages you visit, your browser add-ons, your browser’s width and height, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.

**d.** **Cookies information:** When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. We use cookies to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as allowing you to decide on acceptance of each cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage of the most attractive features of the Service.

**e.** **Log file information:** Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

f. **Clear gifs/web beacons information:** When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.

**g. Device identifiers:** When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Coconuts. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

**h. Location data:** When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.

**i. Commercial and marketing communications:** We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails or push notifications on your mobile device containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. You may opt-out of push notification messages by changing your settings on your mobile device. We will not send you marketing communications using SMS text messages. We also use your information to send you Service-related notices (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices) to your email address or mobile device via push notification. You may not opt out of Service-related messages.

**j. Use of certain service type information we collect about you:** We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; (g) to provide advertising to your browser or device, and (h) automatically update the Coconuts application on your mobile devices.

**3.   SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Coconuts and its group companies (including any parent, subsidiaries and affiliates) without your consent, except as noted below:

**a. Who we may share your information with:** We may share your information with third-party business partners for the purpose of providing the Service to you. Those business partners will be given limited access to your information as is reasonably necessary to deliver the Service, and we will require that such third parties comply with this Privacy Policy.

**b. Who you may choose to share your User Content with:** Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose to the Service, such as User Content (e.g. written posts, comments, or other submissions) becomes available to the public, subject to the sole discretion of Coconuts. In addition, Coconuts allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the Service. If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.

**c. What happens in the event of a change of control:** We may buy or sell/divest/transfer our company (including any shares in the company), or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Your information, such as customer names and email addresses, User Content and other user information related to the Service may be among the items sold or otherwise transferred in these types of transactions. We may also sell, assign or otherwise transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of the company.

**d. Instances where we are required to share your information:** Coconuts reserves the right to disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our [Terms of Use](http://bleacherreport.com/pages/terms) or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Coconuts, our Users or others.

**e. Sharing certain service type information we collect about you:** We may share certain service type information, including information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with our third-party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on “How We Collect and Use Information.” We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.

**f. Ads on Coconuts:** We may also share certain information such as your location, browser and cookie data and other data relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you. Coconuts may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. Coconuts does not sell, rent, or share the information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third-party ad servers or ad networks for such parties’ own marketing purposes, unless you choose in advance to have your information shared for this purpose. Additionally, you may wish to opt-out of receiving cookies by adjusting your browser settings to refuse cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed. See “Your Choices About Your Information” below.

Please note that an advertiser may ask Coconuts to show an ad to a certain audience of Users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests). In that situation, Coconuts determines the target audience and Coconuts serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.

The Coconuts Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.

**4.   HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION**

**a. Storage and Processing:** Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States, Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Manila, Kuala Lumpur or any other country in which Coconuts or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Coconuts may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Coconuts or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

**b. Keeping your information safe:** Coconuts cares about the security of your information, and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Coconuts, at all times. However, Coconuts cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Coconuts or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of Coconuts’s distributors, such as social networks. Coconuts is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.

**c. Compromise of information:** In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Coconuts will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.

**7.   LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES AND SERVICES**

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services linked to or from the Service, including the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link or advertisement on our website, are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies. In addition, you agree that we are not responsible and we do not have control over any third-parties that you authorize to access your User Content. If you are using a third-party website or service (like Facebook or Twitter) and you allow such a third-party access to your User Content, you do so at your own risk. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources other than through the Service.
