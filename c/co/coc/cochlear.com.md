Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available as a link from our home page and from every page on our web site 

**The Information We Collect**

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Cochlear website. You can order products from our online catalog. In addition, you can be part of the Nucleus Forum, receive company information, apply for employment or participate in surveys. The types of personal information collected are: 

  * Name 
  * Address 
  * Email address

  * Implant Data 



**The Way We Use Information:**

We use the information you provide about yourself only for the purpose for which it is provided and we do not share the information with outside parties. 

For example, we use the information you provide when placing an order in the online catalog only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We use your email address in order to deliver Nucleus Forum Peer Counseling and Support information. 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website. For example, we may track information so that we can tell that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

In addition, we automatically track certain information about you. This information includes your domain name and IP address, your browser version, your operating system, the URL you came from, the pages you visit within the Site, and the URL to which you go upon leaving the website. We use this information, in an aggregate form only, to monitor Site performance, utilization of features and services, traffic trends, and browser versions. 

We may use personal information to determine the demographics of our users and to distribute statistics and general marketplace information. These demographics will always represent aggregate information and never identify a specific user. 

The Site includes links to other web sites ("Linked Sites"). Except as expressly stated herein. We shall not share personally identifiable information about users with the operators of such Linked Sites, but may provide aggregate information regarding users to such operators. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the Linked Sites and hereby expressly disclaim all responsibility and liability that may arise therefrom. Links to and from the Website to the Linked Sites does not constitute an endorsement by Cochlear of any Linked Site or its content. 

We also use a technology called "cookies" which can be used to provide tailored information from a website. A cookie is an element of data that is sent to your browser and stored on your system. You may be able to set your browser to refuse a cookie or to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. 

Users in the European Union fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of their personal information in the United States. 

**Our Commitment To Data Security**

To maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. However, you acknowledge that you are aware of security and privacy limitations, including but not limited to (1) the possible limitations or failures of security, privacy and authentication measures and features in this system; and (2) that data or information may be subject to third party eavesdropping or tampering. 

**Our Commitment To Children's Privacy**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. Any information collected openly on the website from children is kept strictly confidential within Cochlear. Any use of such information by Cochlear will not identify individual children. No data will be released to any third party. 

If a person of 15 years or less registers to use the Nucleus Forum they should advise a parent or guardian that they are so registered. 

**How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information**

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online. 

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request by e-mail at info@cochlear.com that credibly shows the error. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before making corrections.
