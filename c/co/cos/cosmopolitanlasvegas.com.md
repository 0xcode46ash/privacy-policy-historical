## A. The Types of Personal Information We Collect From You via This Website

When you browse the Websites or access the internet while staying at The Cosmopolitan we do not collect personal information about you unless you provide it to us. This means that, with two exceptions, we will not know your name, your email address, or any other personal information about you simply because of the Interactions. The exceptions are that if you access the Websites from a link in an email that we sent to you or if you are accessing our public internet. In the first case, we will know who you are based on information you previously supplied to us, and in the second, when you log on to the public internet we ask that you provide basic personal information about you that includes your name, home, work and e-mail addresses, telephone and fax numbers.

When you submit a request for information from us, we collect the personal information you choose to submit to us in the context of your request for information. While you can choose not to provide us with any personal information, or with limited personal information, as part of your request for information from us, if you do so we may not be in a position to respond to your request for information. 

Please note that personal information that you provide during the Interacitons may be provided to and processed by third parties under contract with us. When your personal information is submitted to these third parties, we require those third parties to exercise reasonable care to protect your personal information and restrict the use of your personal information to the purposes for which it was provided. 

We do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of 21. If you are the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 21 and believe that the person has provided The Cosmopolitan with personal information, you may contact us by email at[Privacy@CosmopolitanLasVegas.com](mailto:Privacy@CosmopolitanLasVegas.com), by telephone at 702-698-1000, or by postal mail at: 3708 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109, Attn: Privacy and request that it be deleted from our files. 

## B. Use of Cookies

We may use cookies to ensure ease of future log-ins to the public internet or to obtain information about you while visiting the Websites. A cookie is a very small text file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. It assigns the computer with a unique identifier, which in turn, becomes your identification card whenever you return to the public internet or the Websites. Cookies are designed to save you time because they help us to provide you with a customized experience without you having to remind us of your preferences each time you return. The cookies we use are not designed to damage your files, nor can they read information from other files on your computer hard drive. 

Our cookies are limited to the public internet access and the Websites, and are not designed to follow you when traveling on the Internet. We track the usage of our public internet access and Websites in order to better meet your needs and to help make it easier for you to find information in the future. Please note that in addition to our cookies, various third parties may also place cookies on your computer’s hard drive. The Cosmopolitan is not responsible for the presence or absence of third party cookies, or for the technological capabilities or practices employed by third parties in connection with third party cookies. 

If you would prefer not to have the benefits of cookies, your Internet browser can be adjusted to treat cookies in different ways. Depending upon the type of browser you are using, you may be able to configure your browser so that: (i) you are prompted to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis or (ii) you may be able to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at all. You should refer to the supplier or manufacturer of your web browser for specific details about cookie security. However, you should also understand that rejecting cookies might affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our web sites and our ability to recognize your browser from one visit to the next.

## C. How We Use Personal Information We Collect From You Via This Website

Your personal information may be used for various purposes, including, but not limited to: 

  * providing services such as processing a transaction (e.g., making a reservation, fulfilling a request for information, or completing a product order); 
  * marketing and communications with you in relation to the products and services offered by The Cosmopolitan, our strategic marketing partners, and other third parties; and/or 
  * performing market research via surveys to better serve your needs, improve the effectiveness of our Websites, public internet access, your hotel experience, our various types of communications, advertising campaigns, and/or promotional activities. 



Your permission to use personal information we collect from you via the Interactions in other ways will be implied from the nature of the service requested or transaction undertaken. For example, your permission will be deemed given for communications from us that are necessary to fulfill transactions and services that you request. 

We may also use your personal information for non-marketing purposes such as conducting statistical or demographic analysis. We may also combine personal information you submit to us with other generally or publicly available information to help us identify your preferences or interests or to help us match e-mail addresses with postal addresses. 

If you do not want us or a third party to whom we have provided your personal information to use your personal information for marketing purposes, you may opt-out of such uses by notifying us in accordance with Section E of this Policy. Please note that opting-out will not prevent your personal information from being used for non-marketing purposes. 

In the course of processing your information, it may be necessary to transfer your personal information to The Cosmopolitan’s third party service providers for the purposes outlined within this Policy. As a general practice, we do not sell, rent, or give physical possession of your personal information to third parties other than: 

  * when we have received your consent to do so; 
  * in situations where sharing or disclosing your information is required in order to offer you products or services you desire (e.g., a vacation package); 
  * when companies or services providers that perform business activities on behalf of The Cosmopolitan require such information (e.g., credit card processing, customer support services, market research administration or database management services); 
  * in the event of a business transfer, such as those described below; 
  * to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance with applicable law or court order; and/or 
  * in case of emergency such as to safeguard the life, health, or property of an individual. 



If information is shared as mentioned above, we seek to limit the scope of information that is furnished to the amount necessary for the performance of the specific function. Unless otherwise precluded by legal process, we require third parties to protect your PII and abide by applicable privacy laws and regulations. 

## D. Security Measures We Take to Protect Your Personal Information

We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures in an effort to safeguard the privacy of your personal information from unauthorized access or improper use. From time to time, The Cosmopolitan will review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes available. However, you acknowledge and agree that despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and your personal information may still be accessed and used by others without authorization in the event of a security breach. 

## E. Updating Your Personal Information and Opt-Out Choices

To ensure that your personal information is accurate and up to date, we encourage you to regularly review and update your information as appropriate (e.g., in the event your home or e-mail address changes, or you wish to add an additional method for us to communicate with you). You can access, update, and change the personal information you have provided to us, and modify your opt-out choices, by contacting us by email at: [Privacy@CosmopolitanLasVegas.com](mailto:Privacy@CosmopolitanLasVegas.com), by telephone at 702-698-1000, or by postal mail at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas 3708 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109 Attn: Privacy. Occasionally, information that you request to be removed will be retained in certain files for a period of time in order to properly resolve disputes or to troubleshoot problems. In addition, some types of information may be stored indefinitely on “back up” systems or within log files due to technical constraints, or financial or legal requirements. Therefore, you should not always expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your request. 

You may unsubscribe from marketing e-mails from The Cosmopolitan by clicking on the unsubscribe links in those e-mails. If The Cosmopolitan receives an opt-out or unsubscribe request from you, The Cosmopolitan thereafter (i) will not contact you directly with marketing messages about The Cosmopolitan’s products or services, and (ii) will not use personal information obtained from the Interactions to contact you with marketing messages. Please note that if The Cosmopolitan has shared your personal information with our strategic marketing partners, and other third parties, as described in Section C of this Policy, opting out or unsubscribing from marketing messages from The Cosmopolitan will apply to marketing messages coming from The Cosmopolitan only, and not to marketing messages coming from such third parties. To opt out of messages from our strategic marketing partners, and other third parties, please see such partners' or third parties' individual privacy policies and terms of use. 

## F. Business Transfers

In the event that The Cosmopolitan is acquired by (whether by sale of assets or ownership interests) or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign all of the personal information we have collected from you via the Interactions (including via any survey in which you have participated) as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred or used. 

## G. Policy Changes

Through the Interactions, you agree to let us collect and use personal information per this Policy. In the future, we may change this Policy; we will post changes at this URL and note the effective date so that you are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it. If we decide to change our privacy practices, all changes will be reflected at this URL and the effective date will be posted so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use personal information and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If we materially change our practices regarding collection or use of your personal information, your personal information will continue to be governed by the policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice, and have not objected to, this change. This Policy was last updated on August 29, 2011.
