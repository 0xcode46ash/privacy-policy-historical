**Privacy Policy and Terms of Use**  
This privacy policy describes how Hearst Communications, Inc., the publisher of CosmoGIRL! magazine ("CosmoGIRL!"), treats the personally identifiable information that is collected about you when you visit the Web sites to which this policy is linked, and the information collected on CosmoGIRL!'s behalf to the extent CosmoGIRL! uses third-party service providers to host the Web site or collect information about site users. 

**What is personally identifiable information:** "Personally identifiable information" is information that we can use to identify you as an individual. Personally identifiable information includes your name, address, telephone number, and any other information that is connected with you personally. 

**Information this privacy policy does not apply to:** This privacy policy does not apply to information collected about you by anyone other than CosmoGIRL! (and its third party service providers acting on its behalf) and only applies to the Cosmogirl.com Web site. Any information you provide when you visit Web sites other than those covered by this policy (including the Web site to which you will be linked if you subscribe online to CosmoGIRL magazine and including other Web sites affiliated with Hearst Communications, Inc. and its magazines) or when you purchase any products or services that may be offered or advertised on our Web site by companies other than CosmoGIRL! is subject to the privacy policies posted on such sites by CosmoGIRL!'s affiliates, or, as applicable, those of the third-party organizations who run and/or own these Web sites. This policy also does not apply to information you may provide to us offline. 

Cosmogirl.com collects no personally identifying information about our users unless they knowingly provide us with some. We may place a "cookie" (a small file that contains no personal information) in your computer's browser file, which helps us gather information about your use of the site to better serve all our visitors, and which enables us to provide you some of the games and features on our site. This information may be collected by third party service providers with whom CosmoGIRL! contracts to host the Web site or to fulfill requests for services; in that event, CosmoGIRL! asks such service providers to make the personal information available only to CosmoGIRL! for CosmoGIRL! to use in accordance with the terms of this policy and not to use the information for any other purpose. 

We may use any personal information you send, such as name, age, location, and personal preferences, for content or for marketing and promotional purposes or to send you our newsletter. In addition, we may share your personal information with third parties who may choose to contact you to promote their own goods and services if you have selected the opt-in box authorizing us to do so. If you selected the opt-in box but want us to stop sharing your personal information with third parties in this way, click [here](mailto:webmaster@cosmogirl.com) and let us know. CosmoGIRL! may also share or disclose personally identifiable information about you to other companies or individuals when: 

  * We utilize third-party service providers to provide products, services, or functions on our behalf (such as sending e-mails or processing credit cards or fulfilling subscriptions), and ask these service providers to agree to maintain the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information and not to use your personally identifiable information for any reason except to carry out the purpose(s) for which we hired them; 
  * You enter a contest on our site, in which case we may give your personal information to the contest sponsor who may also use it, and allow others to use it, for marketing purposes; the entity to whom the information is disclosed is one under control of, or under common control with Hearst (for these purposes, a company controlling twenty (20%) percent or more of the voting stock of another entity shall be deemed to control such entity);
  * The entity to whom the information is disclosed is hosting Web sites associated with our magazines or magazines we publish in conjunction with a third party, other than those Web sites covered by this policy;
  * We need to protect our legal rights (for example, if we are trying to collect money you owe us);
  * We must comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal or regulatory process; or
  * In connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of the business conducted by the Web sites to which this policy applies.
