### 1\. General

We, Costa Limited ("Costa"), respect the right to privacy of every individual who visits our site, mobile site or apps ("Digital Channels"), or who otherwise receives services from us or who participates in activities connected with Costa. This privacy policy explains how we use any personal information we collect about you, and your rights to access and correct the personal information we hold about you.

### 2\. What personal information do we collect and how we will use it?

We may collect the following information about you:

  * Contact details including title, name, date of birth, age, postal and email addresses, postcode and contact telephone numbers;
  * Demographic information;
  * Details about your employment status;
  * Registration information, including your password (if any);
  * Customer communication preferences;
  * Customer feedback (which may be collected through customer satisfaction surveys and market research studies);
  * Details of your gender; and
  * Computer or device information (e.g. your IP address and operating system). 



We may use your information for the following purposes:

  * Administration of our Digital Channels;
  * Administration and management of our competitions, promotions and prize draws – you should check the applicable terms and conditions of the competition, promotion or prize draw for further information;
  * Obtaining customer feedback (including through customer satisfaction surveys and market research studies, among other methods);
  * Identifying any unusual customer feedback and scores in respect of particular Costa stores;
  * Business, website and consumer analysis and reporting; and
  * Correspondence between us, including where you use our 'Contact us' form.



Although it is not Costa’s intention to collect any personal information and/or sensitive personal information (e.g. in respect of race or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or similar beliefs; physical or mental health or condition; sexual history or orientation; trade union membership; and/or any criminal offences or related court proceedings) about you when obtaining customer feedback or conducting market research studies (for example, through “Any Other Comments” or “free text” type sections in customer satisfaction surveys or market research studies), if any personal or sensitive personal information is inadvertently collected in this way such information will be securely deleted and will not be retained by Costa or any third parties who provide services to Costa.

### 3\. Sharing your personal information with third parties

We may disclose your personal information to:

  * Any third party where we are under a legal duty to do so, or in order to enforce or protect any of our rights, property or safety (or those of our customers).
  * Third parties who provide certain services to Costa (e.g. IT service providers and service providers who administer customer satisfaction surveys and market research studies on behalf of Costa), (third parties may also collect certain personal information about you on Costa’s behalf).



Where personal information is processed on our behalf by third parties we put measures in place to keep your information secure.

Our Digital Channels contain links to other websites, mobile sites and apps and certain services provided by third parties (e.g. Wi-Fi services available in Costa stores) are available for use by customers. This privacy policy only applies to our channels and services. When you link to other websites, mobile sites, or apps, or use services provided by third parties (e.g. Wi-Fi services available in Costa stores) we are not responsible or liable for them. You should read the privacy policies for those linked sites, apps or services before you submit any personal information to them.

### 4\. Security

Costa takes the security of any personal information we hold very seriously.

Where necessary, and in common with other websites and apps, we use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to ensure that personal information provided to us is not visible to anybody else when in transit between your computer and our servers. You can tell when SSL is in use by the presence of a small "padlock" symbol in the status bar of your web browser.

In addition, our web servers are housed behind a secure firewall that prevents access to our databases by unauthorised users. All of our servers are housed in a secure environment with high levels of physical security.

However, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site: any transmission is at your risk. Once we have received your information, we will handle it in accordance with our usual practices.

Where you have chosen a password that enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

### 5\. International transfers

We may transfer your personal information to, and store it at, destinations outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA") for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy. It may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us, for the Whitbread group of companies or our service providers. By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer. 

Costa will take appropriate measures to ensure that, wherever it is located, your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

### 6\. Direct marketing

We would like to keep you informed of Costa news and offers by post, phone, email, text and other electronic means.

If you have agreed to receive such marketing communications you may opt out or change your marketing preferences at any time by contacting us [here](https://web.archive.org/contact/ "Contact").

### 7\. Access to and amending your personal information

We want to make sure that your personal information is accurate and up to date. You may ask us to correct or remove personal information you think is inaccurate by contacting us [here](https://web.archive.org/contact/ "Contact").

You also have the right to request a copy of the personal information that we hold about you. To do so, please contact us at http://www.costa.co.uk/contact-form. We may make a small charge for this service.
