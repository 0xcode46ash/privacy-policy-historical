As set out above, HPCi Media is committed to safeguarding your personal information. Whenever you provide such information, we are legally obliged to use your information in line with all laws concerning the protection of personal information, including the Data Protection Act 1998 (these laws are referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as the "data protection laws"). 

Our websites contains hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party websites have their own privacy policies, including cookies, and we urge you to review them. They will govern the use of personal information you submit or are collected by cookies whilst visiting these websites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.

## What Information about me will HPCi Media collect?

When you sign up to participate in or receive a service from any HPCi website - such as subscriptions, newsletters, competitions, message boards - we may ask for personal information about you. This can consist of information such as your name, e mail address, business address, telephone or mobile number. Different web pages may ask for different personal information. Where you are asked to submit details of your credit card HPCi confirms that it will not retain any of these details and they will be used solely for processing the transaction.

HPCi Media also uses cookies (see below for details) and collects IP addresses (an IP address is a number that can uniquely identify a specific computer or other network device on the internet). We use analysis software to look at IP addresses and cookies for the purpose of enhancing your user experience. This information is not used to develop a personal profile of you and the log files are regularly purged.

## How will HPCi Media use the information they collect about me?

HPCi Media will use your personal information for a number of purposes including the following:

  * to deliver any products or services you have requested;
  * for "service administration purposes", which means that HPCi Media may contact you for reasons related to the service you have signed up for, as set out below (e.g. to provide you with password reminders or to notify you that a particular service has been suspended for maintenance);
  * to inform you of other relevant products and services that as far as HPCi determine match your industry and job function;
  * to contact you about a submission you have made to the websites, including any content you provide;
  * to personalise the way HPCi content is presented to you;
  * IP addresses are used to identify the location of users, the number of visits from different countries and also to block disruptive use; and
  * to analyse and improve the services offered on the Websites. e.g. to provide you with the most user-friendly navigation experience.



Where HPCi Media proposes using your personal information for any other uses we will ensure that we notify you first. You will also be given the opportunity to withhold or withdraw your consent for your use other than as listed above. 

## When will HPCi Media contact me?

HPCi Media may contact you:

  * in relation to the functioning of any service you have signed up for in order to ensure that HPCi Media can deliver the services to you;
  * where you have opted to receive further correspondence;
  * in relation to any contribution you have made to hpcimedia.com, e.g. on HPCi Media message boards;
  * to invite you to participate in surveys about HPCi Media services (participation is always voluntary); and
  * for marketing purposes where legislation permits this and you have not told us that you do not wish to be contacted.



## Will HPCi Media share my personal information with anyone else?

We will keep and use your information in line with best practice and our legal obligations under the current UK data protection and privacy legislation.

## Offensive or inappropriate content on the Websites

If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on the Websites, or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on the Websites, HPCi Media may use your personal information to stop such behaviour.

Where HPCi Media reasonably believes that you are or may be in breach of any of the laws of England or Wales (e.g. because content you have posted may be defamatory), HPCi Media may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your employer, school e-mail/Internet provider or law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.

## How long will HPCi Media keep my personal information? 

We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant service, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with HPCi Media. 

Where you contribute to our Websites we will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted. 

## Can I find out what personal information HPCi Media holds about me?

Under the Data Protection Act you have the right to request a copy of the personal information HPCi Media holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. (We charge £10 for information requests and will require you to prove your identity with 2 pieces of approved photographic identification.) We will use reasonable efforts to supply, correct or delete personal information about you on our files.

Please address requests and questions about this or any other question about this Privacy Policy to the Data Protection Officer, HPCi Media, Unit 1, Vogans Mill Wharf, Mill Street, London, SE1 2BZ. 

## What if I am accessing the Websites outside the UK?

## Cookies Policy 

### What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device";) browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.

Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the websites to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the hpcimedia.com features. Each browser is different, so check the help menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

During the course of any visit to hpcimedia.com, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.

### How does HPCi Media use cookies?

Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. This can be achieved through personalisation of your web pages or analysing user activity to determine what is more popular and what is not.
