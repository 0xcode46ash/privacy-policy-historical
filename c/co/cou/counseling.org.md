# Press Releases

ACA developed this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our current information-gathering and dissemination practices for this site.   We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of this Privacy Policy, and any changes will be posted here.  Please refer back to this Privacy Policy regularly because your use of this website signifies that you agree to be bound by this Policy, as might be amended from time to time.

## **Information Collected**

Data collected by ACA is used to provide better service to ACA members and users of ACA’s web site. **It is ACA’s policy to collect and store information of a personal nature only if knowingly provided by members and users.  **

## Browsing

ACA does not collect any personal information from users browsing its web site. Users to the public areas of ACA’s web site browse anonymously. Only aggregate data, such as IP addresses and the number of hits per page, are collected; these data do not provide any personally identifying information and are only used for internal analysis of web site usage and traffic.

## **ACA Website Registrants**

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like name and email address). We use that contact information to send you updates and stay in contact with you.   By providing such information, you consent to it being used for these purposes, unless you opt-out (see below).  ACA rents its mailing lists to other like-minded organizations and individuals that have an interest in marketing to the Counseling Profession. ACA carefully reviews each mailing piece prior to approval. Items must be of professional interest to ACA members.  Questions about the collection and use of this information can be addressed to the ACA webmaster at webmaster@counseling.org.

## **Opt-Out**

Users can have their name and data removed from our mailing lists at any time by sending email to [acamemberservices@counseling.org](mailto:acamemberservices@counseling.org) or call ACA Member Services at 800-347-6647 x222.

## **Correction/Updating Personal Information**

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your email address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. Send email to [acamemberservices@counseling.org](mailto:acamemberservices@counseling.org) or call ACA Member Services at 800-347-6647 x222.

## **Cookies**

If a user chooses to register with our web site, a cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. This saves you from having to log in every time you visit our web site.  If you reject the cookie, you are still able to use our site by logging in. Cookies also enable us to enhance the experience on our site by customizing content based on your interests. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to offer to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.

## **Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

## **Credit Card Security**

ACA does not disclose to anyone credit card account information provided by its members and customers. Credit card information is used only for processing payments. ACA uses commercially reasonable security measures consistent with standard industry practice, to safeguard financial, personal and other information collected through this Service.  We believe these commercially reasonable practices provide adequate security to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information we collect on our Service.  We also limit access to personal information to only those employees who need the information to perform a specific job. 

All credit card transactions are guaranteed secure by VeriSign.
