Use of cookies | Back to top  
  
Unlike some companies, we designed many features of our site to let new visitors anonymously learn about our financial products and services, view today’s rates and use our educational tools without revealing their identities. For these new visitors, the only information we collect online is from cookies, pixel tags or similar devices, which provide limited data, such as the date, time and areas of our site that were visited, interactions with the site, and the Web path/domain where the visitor came from. This general information enables us to serve customers better by continually improving our Web site, making it more convenient, and improving our Internet marketing efforts. When you go online and select one of our financial products or services, log in to review your accounts, or respond to our marketing materials sent directly to you, we will try to identify your browser and may combine information from  cookies, pixel tags or other similar devices with other information you have provided to us and other data we maintain about you. We do this to better serve your financial needs and make your online experience more convenient.

Cookies are Required to operate the Your Accounts feature

It is possible to disable cookies on your Web browser. If you do so, it is not possible for us to offer you the Your Accounts service for accessing consolidated information online about all your accounts with the Countrywide Financial family of companies.

Benefits to sharing outside the Countrywide family | Back to top  
  
To make products and services available, often at substantial savings to you, we may prudently share some customer and former customer non-public personal information with business partners under an agreement requiring that the information be kept confidential and used only for those offers. Our business partners may have privacy policies which vary from those set forth herein.  
  
   
Information we gather and communicate | Back to top  
In order to provide financial products and services, comply with government regulations, improve our products and services and better understand your financial needs, we collect and maintain a range of customer and former customer data including non-public personal information: 

  * From applications, supporting documents and other forms (such as your phone, Social Security and account numbers, assets, income and employment history) 
  * About your transactions with us, our affiliates and our business partners (such as your loan balance, payment history and other account information) 
  * From a credit reporting agency (such as your credit worthiness and credit history) 
  * From business partners, current or past employees, other financial institutions or vendors and service companies (such as a property appraisal, income information, purchase contract or membership number) 



We are periodically required to disclose some of this data to third parties, such as credit reporting agencies, title and insurance carriers, federal and state regulators and loan investors, in order to do business with you. We may also share all of this information with companies that perform services on our behalf (such as the vendors who prepare our monthly statements or provide ATM access to your accounts). These business partners contractually agree to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose.

Additional, in order to provide you with valuable product and service offers, we share limited amounts of this non-public personal information (such as a list of customers in a certain income range) within our Countrywide family of companies and with well-respected business partners who are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your information.   
  
   
You have choices | Back to top  
   
  
Because we respect your right to privacy, we give you the choice of how your personal information may be shared. You may choose to

  1. Allow Countrywide to share limited amounts of your personal information within and outside the Countrywide family of companies, 
  2. Limit information sharing outside the Countrywide family of companies, or 
  3. Limit information sharing with the Countrywide family of companies. 

  
The process of limiting our ability to share your information is called "opting out." 

We provide you three different options to consider, and have a strong commitment to honor your request. They are to:

  * Continue receiving valuable and convenient product and service offers

No action is required if you want to enjoy the benefits of valuable product and service offers by allowing Countrywide to share limited amounts of your personal information within and outside the Countrywide family of companies. 



  * Opt out of information sharing outside the Countrywide family of companies

Making this decision will prevent us from sharing non-public, personal information with our well-respected, carefully screened business partners. This choice may limit our ability to inform you of valuable and convenient products and services from partner companies.

  * Opt out of information sharing within the Countrywide family of companies

Making this decision will prevent us from sharing non-public, personal information within the Countrywide family of companies. This choice may limit our ability to offer conveniences such as a tailored savings quote on homeowners insurance, a custom financial investment plan, other financial service offers and more.

Some state laws already require us to maintain more restrictive practices for sharing information. For state specific information, visit the appropriate business segment by clicking on one of the tabs at the top of our Home Page or review the information when you obtain one of our products or services. 




  
For loans to multiple borrowers, we will treat an opt out by any borrower as applying to all borrowers on the loan. Please be aware that even if you decide to opt out, Countrywide will continue to share non-public personal information with companies that perform services on our behalf (such as the vendor who prepares our monthly statements) and with third parties as otherwise required or permitted by law (such as to credit reporting agencies or regulators), as well as share transactions and experience (such as your loan balance or payment history) within the Countrywide family of companies.

During the application process, you'll be provided with a privacy notice that includes a toll-free phone number to call if you decide to exercise either of the opt out choices. Or, if you have any questions about our privacy policy, please send an email message to: : [privacypolicy@countrywide.com](mailto:privacypolicy@countrywide.com)  
  
   
| About Internet Security  
|  | How Does Browser Security Work? | Back to top  
---|---  
Recent versions of most internet browsers support the encrypted transmission of on-line documents and the data you enter on a web page. This means that instead of sending readable text, both your browser and the web site's secure server encode all text using a security key. That way, personal data sent to your browser or data you send back would be extremely difficult to decode in the unlikely event it was intercepted by an unauthorized party. The key used for encoding is a random number that is unique to your session at the secure web site. 

There are two grades of internet security: International-grade encryption uses a 40-bit random number negotiated between your browser and the web-server. This means that only one out of about 1,000,000,000,000 possible decoding keys can be used to decipher your data. Domestic-grade encryption uses a 128-bit key, so that the number of possible keys is vastly larger. The Countrywide site uses the highest grade of encryption supported by your browser and your internet connection.   
  
   
How Do I Know If Security is Operating? | Back to top  
Your internet session is encrypted if your security-enabled browser is connected to a web site using the Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol. URL strings beginning with "HTTPS://" instead of the usual "HTTP://" indicate that the secure protocol is in effect. Your browser may also tell you if security is operating. For example, Netscape Navigator may display the  icon in the lower left corner of your screen in secure mode. If 128-bit security is in effect, it shows the  icon. Microsoft Internet Explorer shows a  icon in either case. Note that security may be operating without any visible indication if the web page you are viewing employs frames (see below). 

If secure transmission is not in effect or only part of a frame-based page is secure, Netscape shows the "broken key"  icon, and Explorer does not show the "lock" icon. 

Most browsers can be set to give you a pop-up announcement when you enter or leave a secure web page. In Netscape, these settings are on the Security Preferences "General" tab. In IE, the setting is on the "Advanced" tab when you select "Options" on the View menu.   
  
   
Secure Mode and Frame-Based Web Pages | Back to top  
Security may be operating without displaying any security icons (or Netscape may show the "broken key" icon) if only part of a frame-based page is employing security. You can verify the security of page within a frame by opening it in a new browser window. Both IE and Netscape allow you to open a link in a new window by right-clicking on the link and selecting that option from the pop-up context menu. When a secure page is open in its own window, instead of being viewed within a frame, you can then see the security icons provided by your browser as well as the "https://" secure protocol prefix in the URL string.

|  | Cookies | Back to top  
---|---  
When you visit a site, a file called a “cookie” may be saved to your computer’s hard drive during your visit. When you revisit the site, the Web site’s server may open the cookie file and access the stored information. You can set your browser to limit or let you know about cookies that a Web site places on your computer.   
   
Pixel tags and Third-Party cookies | Back to top  
A pixel tag is a graphic on a Web page or in an email message that is designed to monitor whether the Web page or email message is read or clicked. Pixel tags are often invisible because they are very small in size, typically 1-by-1 pixels. Pixel files are also used for alignment purposes on Web pages of many Web sites. We sometimes use pixel tags to provide an independent accounting of how many people visit our Web sites or to gather statistics about browser usage at our Web sites. It is difficult for you to limit the use of pixel tags because there is no easy method of distinguishing pixel tags from alignment pixel files. A pixel tag may be loaded from a different Web server than the rest of the page.

We sometimes use third party ad serving companies to serve our internet ad banners on our site and other sites on which we advertise. If you click on one of those ads, you can go to one of the Countrywide Financial sites offering that particular product or service. These ads contain small graphics with “tags” to tell us how many people responded to our ads. They do not identify you personally. The companies that distribute our ads are prohibited by contract from using information other than for the agreed upon purpose – to help us market our products and services and to measure response rates.   
  
   
Similar Devices | Back to top  
For example, we include unique URLs in email marketing materials sent directly to you (such as special offers) so that we can identify that it is you responding to the campaign and provide details on the offer available to you.   
   
| identity theft  
|  | What is Identity Theft? | Back to top  
---|---  
Identity theft is when someone takes and uses your personal information (such as your name, social security or credit card number) without your permission to commit fraud or other crimes. These criminals take the identities of others to open new credit cards; obtain phone or utility accounts, loans, or employment; open bank accounts; and/or pass fraudulent checks. According to the FBI, identity theft is the fastest growing crime in America.  
   
How Does Identity Theft Occur? | Back to top  
Criminals gain access to personal information in many ways, but the most common method is to take it from the victim themselves - you. They steal mail (such as account statements, new checks and offers of credit) left in a mailbox, discarded in the trash or stored in an easy to get to location in your home or office. They take credit card and personal identification from your purse or wallet. Without knowing it, you may give the information directly to the criminal when you enter data at an unsecured or unknown website, or in response to a fraudulent request for account information through an unverified e-mail ("[phishing](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/phishingalrt.htm)"). Imposters also ask for information from you in unsolicited phone calls, tricking you into thinking it is someone you know, such as your bank ("[pretexting](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/credit/pretext.htm)").   
   
What Happens to the Victim? | Back to top  
Identity thieves can damage the credit reputations and lives of victims. Studies have shown that victims spend an average of $808 and 205 hours resolving the identity theft. Time and money is spent clearing credit reports, reporting the theft to lenders and merchants, and filing complaints with law enforcement and governmental agencies. One of the menacing problems of identity theft is that it can happen more than once. Once the initial incident is resolved, the thief may begin using the victim’s identity again after waiting 6 months to a year and the cycle begins all over again.   
   
How Can I Prevent Becoming a Victim? | Back to top  
Identity theft requires someone to gain access to your personal information. You can take steps to decrease the risk of someone stealing your information.  
  
  * Destroy papers you throw out. Shred or completely destroy any documents that contain personal information before discarding them in the trash. This includes information about you, your family, your home, or your accounts such as credit card solicitations, pre-approved credit offers, convenience checks contained in your statements, bills, cancelled checks, loan offerings, ATM or credit card receipts, insurance or tax information. Just as important are receipts from ATM’s or self-service devices such as gasoline pumps. Don’t just leave them behind or throw them in the trash. Criminals only need a few pieces of information about you to get credit in your name and access your existing accounts. 
  * Be careful who you give your information to over the telephone. Do not give out personal information such as your social security number, credit card or bank account numbers, or loan numbers over the phone to anyone who has called you without first confirming who you are speaking to, why they need the information and that they are who they claim to be. 
  * Guard your PINs. Never give out your Personal Identification Number (PIN). Memorize your PINs and never write them on your cards or carry them in your wallet.
  * Report lost or stolen credit cards, checks or identification immediately.
  * Store your personal information securely. Keep it where it is not easily available in the event of a burglary or other unauthorized access.
  * Be cautious online. Make sure it is safe when you are asked to provide information at websites or with online merchants you do not have an existing relationship with. Always confirm that you are in a secure session before entering personal information online (see [How Do I Know if Security is Operating?](https://web.archive.org/web/20031202161821id_/http%3A//my.countrywide.com/Privacy.asp?linkid=PCFT014#about_internet_security)). 
  * Check your credit reports. Review your credit report regularly to identify any inquiries or accounts that you are not aware of and did not apply for. 
  * Protect your mailbox. If your residential mailbox is not secure, don’t put outgoing mail in the box and promptly pick up incoming mail or obtain a secure postal mailbox. 
  * Safeguard your checks. Never print your personal information such as a Social Security Number or driver’s license number on your checks.

  
   
What Should I Do if I Become a Victim of Identity Theft? | Back to top  
  
  * Contact the three major credit bureaus  | Equifax  
P.O. Box 05873

---|---|---  
Ask them to send you a copy of your credit report and instruct them to place a fraud alert on your record. Once you receive the report, review it carefully. Contact any creditors listed that you did not apply for credit with and inform them that you have been a victim of identity theft. Instruct them to close the account, send you copies of the application and any transactions, and to promptly clear your credit record. 
  * Contact your local police or sheriff’s department and file an identity theft complaint.
  * File a [complaint](https://rn.ftc.gov/pls/dod/widtpubl$.startup?Z_ORG_CODE=PU03) with the Federal Trade Commission at [www.consumer.gov/idtheft](http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft) or via their hotline at 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338).

What is Countrywide Doing to Assist in the Battle Against Identity Theft? | Back to top  
Protecting the confidentiality and security of our customers’ personal information is a priority for Countrywide and its family of companies. You can find more information in our [Privacy and Security Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20031202161821id_/http%3A//my.countrywide.com/Privacy.asp?linkid=PCFT014). We understand the implications identity theft can have and take very specific steps to reduce the chance that identity thieves can damage the credit reputations of our customers. As a result, Countrywide has put multiple safety measures in place to combat identity theft.  
   
| Training  
---  
  | Countrywide trains key employees in customer identification and authentication. Our training is designed to reduce the chance of an account or loan being opened in your name without your permission. We regularly update training to educate our employees on changing trends in identity theft.  
   
Fraud Hotline  
  | For many years, Countrywide has maintained a Fraud Hotline for consumers, employees and the public to report crimes, including identity theft. Fraud Hotline staff work with departments across the Countrywide family of companies to block credit reporting based on claims of identity theft, conduct investigations including reviews of the account or loan documentation, and, if identity theft is confirmed, notify the credit bureaus and correct credit reporting history on affected Countrywide relationships. The Fraud Hotline serves as a single point of contact for consumers to report identity theft complaints to Countrywide and we respond within 48 hours. You can reach the Fraud Hotline by any method described under the _Reporting Identity Theft on a Countrywide Relationship_ section below.  
   
CreditGuard™  
  | Countrywide also offers a variety of services to help customers protect themselves against identity theft including [CreditGuard](http://www.countrywidecreditguard.com/order_guard_info.jsp?login=&reporttype=&source=EMPL0000). Offered through Countrywide’s LandSafe subsidiary, CreditGuard provides round-the-clock monitoring of your credit report and notification if any critical information changes.   
   
Education  
  | Consumer awareness is a critical component in reducing the incidence of identity theft. Countrywide provides consumer education and training on identity theft through featured articles in our quarterly newsletters, statement messaging and our websites.  
   
Industry Associations  
  | Countrywide works in concert with industry groups in developing legislation, policies and practices to fight identity theft and other crimes in the businesses we operate in. Countrywide also works with these industry groups in the establishment and adherence to security and customer authentication programs to ensure that we remain an industry leader in protecting your identity and assets held with us.  
   
Law Enforcement  
  | Countrywide coordinates with local, state and federal law enforcement when identity theft cases arise.
