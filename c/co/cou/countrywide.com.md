|  | Your Privacy  
The opportunities you deserve, the privacy you expect  
---  
Countrywide Financial Corporation, a trusted leader for over 30 years in the home loan industry, offers a wide range of financial products and services through our family of companies. This section explains how the Countrywide family of companies protects and uses your information in a safe, secure and responsible manner.  
   
We offer you products and services at a lower cost or with greater convenience by sharing limited information within our Countrywide family of companies and with carefully selected business partners.  
   
Your protection is our priority  
  
We strive to safeguard your data. We do this by:

  * setting policies and procedures for carefully handling your information; 
  * limiting employee access to sensitive information; 
  * protecting against unauthorized access to customer data using data encryption, authentication, and virus detection technology; 
  * requiring service providers who do business with Countrywide to comply with privacy laws; 
  * auditing company security practices; 
  * monitoring our websites through recognized online privacy and security organizations such as TruSecure Corporation; and 
  * conducting background checks on all employees and providing privacy training. 

  
  
  
About our websites | Back to top  
  
Our systems automatically switch to "secure" mode when you are asked to enter personal information on a Countrywide website (such as your loan number, account number or social security number). To keep your data safe, we use:

  * Encryption and authentication technology 
  * Website design that blocks or limits online display of customer information when not necessary to the transaction 
  * IDs and passwords to protect customer information 



For more details on Internet security, please see our "About Internet Security" section

Use of cookies and Web beacons | Back to top  
  
We design many features of our website so new visitors may anonymously learn about our products and services, view today’s rates and use our educational tools without revealing their identity. For new visitors, we use "cookies" and Web beacons to collect limited data (such as the date, time and areas of our website visited and the website the new visitor came from). When you select one of our products or services, review your accounts online or respond to marketing materials sent to you directly, we will try to identify your browser and may combine information from "cookies," Web beacons and other information collected online with any other data we maintain about you. By improving the marketing and content of our website and making your online experience more convenient, we are able to better serve our customers' financial needs.

Cookies are required to operate the Your Accounts feature  
You can have your Web browser disable "cookies." If you turn off "cookies," it is not possible for us to offer you the Your Accounts service. Your Accounts provides online access to consolidated information about all of your accounts with the Countrywide Financial family of companies.   
   
Benefits to sharing within the Countrywide family | Back to top  
To offer and recommend valuable products and services, we may share customer and former customer information within our Countrywide family. All of these Countrywide companies follow the same policies and procedures described in this section.  
|    
---

As Countrywide Financial continues to expand its Global Operations, we also look for ways to enhance customer satisfaction in the United States by using our resources overseas. Our mission is to quickly respond to your homeownership and financial needs at all hours of the day.  
   
Benefits to sharing outside the Countrywide family | Back to top  
  
To make products and services available, often at a savings to you, we may prudently share some customer and former customer non-public personal information with business partners under an agreement requiring the partner to keep the information confidential and only use it for those offers.  
  
   
How we obtain and use information | Back to top  
To fund and service your loan, comply with government regulations, improve our products and services, and better understand your financial needs, we collect and maintain customer and former customer data. We collect information: 

  * you provide us on applications and other forms (such as your phone, Social Security and account numbers, assets, income and employment history); 
  * about your transactions with us (such as your loan balance, payment history and other account information); 
  * about your credit history from a credit reporting agency; and 
  * about you or your property from business partners and service providers (such as a property appraisal, purchase contract or membership number).



We disclose some of this data to third parties (such as credit reporting agencies, regulators and loan investors). We may share some of this information with companies performing services on our behalf (such as the vendor who prepares our monthly statements). These service providers agree to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose.

Additionally, to provide you with valuable product and service offerings, we share limited information (such as a list of customers in a certain income range) within our Countrywide family of companies and with business partners who are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your information.  
  
   
You have choices | Back to top  
You may limit how we share your personal information. This is called a right to "opt out." You have three options to consider. 

  1. Continue receiving valuable and convenient product and service offers  
You can enjoy the benefits of valuable product and service offerings without taking any action. 
  2. Opt out of information sharing outside the Countrywide family of companies  
This choice would stop us from sharing non-public personal information with our carefully screened business partners. This may limit our ability to inform you of valuable and convenient products and services from partner companies. 
  3. Opt out of information sharing within the Countrywide family of companies  
This choice would stop us from sharing non-public personal information within the Countrywide family of companies. This may limit our ability to offer conveniences such as a tailored savings quote on homeowners insurance, a custom financial investment plan, and other financial service offers.



We honor our customers’ privacy choices across the family of companies. For loans to multiple borrowers, we will apply an opt out by any borrower to all borrowers on the loan. If you opt out, we will continue to share non-public personal information with our service providers (such as the vendor who prepares our monthly statements), with third parties as required or permitted by law (such as credit reporting agencies or regulators), and share transaction and experience information (such as your loan balance or payment history) within the Countrywide family of companies.

During the application process, you will receive a privacy notice that includes a toll-free telephone number to call if you want to opt-out. Please have your account and billing information available when you call. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please send an e-mail message to [privacypolicy@countrywide.com](mailto:privacypolicy@countrywide.com).

In today’s dynamic market, opting out may mean missing timely information about products and services that help you accomplish your homeownership and other financial goals. It's something to think about carefully. We don’t want you to miss out on any opportunities.

| About Internet Security  
|  | How Does Browser Security Work? | Back to top  
---|---  
  
Recent versions of most internet browsers support the encrypted transmission of on-line documents and the data you enter on a web page. This means that instead of sending readable text, both your browser and the website's secure server encode all text using a security key. That way, personal data sent to your browser or data you send back would be extremely difficult to decode in the unlikely event it was intercepted by an unauthorized party. The key used for encoding is a random number that is unique to your session at the secure website.

There are two grades of internet security: International-grade encryption uses a 40-bit random number negotiated between your browser and the web-server. This means that only one out of about 1,000,000,000,000 possible decoding keys can be used to decipher your data. Domestic-grade encryption uses a 128-bit key, so that the number of possible keys is vastly larger. The Countrywide site uses the highest grade of encryption supported by your browser and your internet connection.  
  
   
How Do I Know If Security is Operating? | Back to top  
Your internet session is encrypted if your security-enabled browser is connected to a website using the Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol. URL strings beginning with "HTTPS://" instead of the usual "HTTP://" indicate that the secure protocol is in effect. Your browser may also tell you if security is operating. For example, Netscape Navigator may display the  icon in the lower left corner of your screen in secure mode. If 128-bit security is in effect, it shows the  icon. Microsoft Internet Explorer shows a  icon in either case. Note that security may be operating without any visible indication if the web page you are viewing employs frames (see below). 

If secure transmission is not in effect or only part of a frame-based page is secure, Netscape shows the "broken key"  icon, and Explorer does not show the "lock" icon. 

Most browsers can be set to give you a pop-up announcement when you enter or leave a secure web page. In Netscape, these settings are on the Security Preferences "General" tab. In IE, the setting is on the "Advanced" tab when you select "Options" on the View menu.   
  
   
Secure Mode and Frame-Based Web Pages | Back to top  
Security may be operating without displaying any security icons (or Netscape may show the "broken key" icon) if only part of a frame-based page is employing security. You can verify the security of a page within a frame by opening it in a new browser window. Both IE and Netscape allow you to open a link in a new window by right-clicking on the link and selecting that option from the pop-up context menu. When a secure page is open in its own window, instead of being viewed within a frame, you can then see the security icons provided by your browser as well as the "https://" secure protocol prefix in the URL string.   
   
| cookies, web beacons  
|  | Cookies | Back to top  
---|---  
When you visit a website, a small file called a "cookie" may be saved to your computer’s hard drive during your visit. When you revisit the site, the website’s server may open the cookie file and access the stored information. You can usually set your browser to limit or let you know about cookies that a website places on your computer.   
   
Web Beacons | Back to top  
  
A Web beacon is a graphic image (such as a pixel tag or clear GIF) that is placed on a web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity (such as whether the web page or e-mail message is read or clicked). They are often invisible because they are very small in size. They are also used on many web pages for alignment purposes. We sometimes use Web beacons to provide an independent accounting of how many people visit our websites or to gather statistics about browser usage at our websites. Some of our web pages and HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters use Web beacons in conjunction with cookies. It is difficult for you to limit the use of Web beacons because there is no easy way to distinguish their use from alignment and other purposes. They may be loaded from a different web server than the rest of the page.  
  
   
Third Party Advertising | Back to top  
  
We sometimes use third party advertising companies to serve our internet ad banners on our site and other sites on which we advertise. If you click on one of those ads, you will be directed to one of the Countrywide Financial sites offering that particular product or service. If you view a web page where our ads appear, the advertising company may place a cookie on your computer or use a Web beacon to access a cookie they previously placed on your computer. These companies do not collect information that can identify you personally, but may use information about your visits to our sites and other sites to measure the effectiveness of ads. We do not give any personally identifiable information to these companies. Unless you are first notified, these advertising companies do not link any online actions or cookie to any information that can be used to personally identify you (such as your name, address or e-mail address). The companies that distribute our ads are prohibited by contract from using information other than for the agreed upon purpose – to help us market our products and services and to measure response rates.

Third party advertisers are subject to their own privacy policies. Currently, we use Avenue A, Inc. as one of our third party advertisers. If you would like more information about the privacy practices of Avenue A, including information on how to opt-out of their cookies, please click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) to visit the Network Advertising Initiative website. To prevent other advertising companies from placing cookies on your computer, you may adjust the privacy settings for your browser to block or filter cookies, or visit each website individually and opt-out.

For example, we include URLs in e-mail marketing materials sent directly to you (such as special offers) so that we can identify that it is you responding to the campaign and provide details on the offer available to you.

| identity theft  
|  | What is Identity Theft? | Back to top  
---|---  
Identity theft is when someone takes and uses your personal information (such as your name, social security or credit card number) without your permission to commit fraud or other crimes. These criminals take the identities of others to open new credit cards; obtain phone or utility accounts, loans, or employment; open bank accounts; and/or pass fraudulent checks. According to the FBI, identity theft is the fastest growing crime in America.  
   
How Does Identity Theft Occur? | Back to top  
Criminals gain access to personal information in many ways, but the most common method is to take it from the victim themselves - you. They steal mail (such as account statements, new checks and offers of credit) left in a mailbox, discarded in the trash or stored in an easy to get to location in your home or office. They take credit card and personal identification from your purse or wallet. Without knowing it, you may give the information directly to the criminal when you enter data at an unsecured or unknown website, or in response to a fraudulent request for account information through an unverified e-mail ("[phishing](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/phishingalrt.htm)"). Imposters also ask for information from you in unsolicited phone calls, tricking you into thinking it is someone you know, such as your bank ("[pretexting](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/credit/pretext.htm)").   
   
What Happens to the Victim? | Back to top  
Identity thieves can damage the credit reputations and lives of victims. Studies have shown that victims spend an average of $808 and 205 hours resolving the identity theft. Time and money is spent clearing credit reports, reporting the theft to lenders and merchants, and filing complaints with law enforcement and governmental agencies. One of the menacing problems of identity theft is that it can happen more than once. Once the initial incident is resolved, the thief may begin using the victim’s identity again after waiting 6 months to a year and the cycle begins all over again.   
   
How Can I Prevent Becoming a Victim? | Back to top  
Identity theft requires someone to gain access to your personal information. You can take steps to decrease the risk of someone stealing your information.  
  
  * Destroy papers you throw out. Shred or completely destroy any documents that contain personal information before discarding them in the trash. This includes information about you, your family, your home, or your accounts such as credit card solicitations, pre-approved credit offers, convenience checks contained in your statements, bills, cancelled checks, loan offerings, ATM or credit card receipts, insurance or tax information. Just as important are receipts from ATM’s or self-service devices such as gasoline pumps. Don’t just leave them behind or throw them in the trash. Criminals only need a few pieces of information about you to get credit in your name and access your existing accounts. 
  * Be careful who you give your information to over the telephone. Do not give out personal information such as your social security number, credit card or bank account numbers, or loan numbers over the phone to anyone who has called you without first confirming who you are speaking to, why they need the information and that they are who they claim to be. 
  * Guard your PINs. Never give out your Personal Identification Number (PIN). Memorize your PINs and never write them on your cards or carry them in your wallet. 
  * Report lost or stolen credit cards, checks or identification immediately.
  * Store your personal information securely. Keep it where it is not easily available in the event of a burglary or other unauthorized access. 
  * Be cautious online. Make sure it is safe when you are asked to provide information at websites or with online merchants you do not have an existing relationship with. Always confirm that you are in a secure session before entering personal information online (see [How Do I Know if Security is Operating?](https://web.archive.org/web/20041204183013id_/http%3A//my.countrywide.com/Privacy.aspx?linkid=PCFT014#about_internet_security)). 
  * Check your credit reports. Review your credit report regularly to identify any inquiries or accounts that you are not aware of and did not apply for. 
  * Protect your mailbox. If your residential mailbox is not secure, don’t put outgoing mail in the box and promptly pick up incoming mail or obtain a secure postal mailbox. 
  * Safeguard your checks. Never print your personal information such as a Social Security Number or driver’s license number on your checks.

  
   
What Should I Do if I Become a Victim of Identity Theft? | Back to top  
  
  * Contact the three major credit bureaus Ask them to send you a copy of your credit report and instruct them to place a fraud alert on your record. Once you receive the report, review it carefully. Contact any creditors listed that you did not apply for credit with and inform them that you have been a victim of identity theft. Instruct them to close the account, send you copies of the application and any transactions, and to promptly clear your credit record. 
  * Contact your local police or sheriff’s department and file an identity theft complaint. 
  * File a [ complaint](https://rn.ftc.gov/pls/dod/widtpubl$.startup?Z_ORG_CODE=PU03) with the Federal Trade Commission at [ www.consumer.gov/idtheft](http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft) or via their hotline at 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338).

What is Countrywide Doing to Assist in the Battle Against Identity Theft? | Back to top  
Protecting the confidentiality and security of our customers’ personal information is a priority for Countrywide and its family of companies. You can find more information in our [ Privacy and Security Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20041204183013id_/http%3A//my.countrywide.com/Privacy.aspx?linkid=PCFT014). We understand the implications identity theft can have and take very specific steps to reduce the chance that identity thieves can damage the credit reputations of our customers. As a result, Countrywide has put multiple safety measures in place to combat identity theft.  
   
| Training  
---  
  | Countrywide trains key employees in customer identification and authentication. Our training is designed to reduce the chance of an account or loan being opened in your name without your permission. We regularly update training to educate our employees on changing trends in identity theft.  
   
Fraud Hotline  
  | For many years, Countrywide has maintained a Fraud Hotline for consumers, employees and the public to report crimes, including identity theft. Fraud Hotline staff work with departments across the Countrywide family of companies to block credit reporting based on claims of identity theft, conduct investigations including reviews of the account or loan documentation, and, if identity theft is confirmed, notify the credit bureaus and correct credit reporting history on affected Countrywide relationships. The Fraud Hotline serves as a single point of contact for consumers to report identity theft complaints to Countrywide and we respond within 48 hours. You can reach the Fraud Hotline by any method described under the _Reporting Identity Theft on a Countrywide Relationship_ section below.  
   
CreditGuard™  
  | Countrywide also offers a variety of services to help customers protect themselves against identity theft including [ CreditGuard](http://www.countrywide.com/creditcenter?linkid=CREDG01). Offered through Countrywide’s LandSafe subsidiary, CreditGuard provides round-the-clock monitoring of your credit report and notification if any critical information changes.   
   
Education  
  | Consumer awareness is a critical component in reducing the incidence of identity theft. Countrywide provides consumer education and training on identity theft through featured articles in our quarterly newsletters, statement messaging and our websites.  
   
Industry Associations  
  | Countrywide works in concert with industry groups in developing legislation, policies and practices to fight identity theft and other crimes in the businesses we operate in. Countrywide also works with these industry groups in the establishment and adherence to security and customer authentication programs to ensure that we remain an industry leader in protecting your identity and assets held with us.  
   
Law Enforcement  
  | Countrywide coordinates with local, state and federal law enforcement when identity theft cases arise.
