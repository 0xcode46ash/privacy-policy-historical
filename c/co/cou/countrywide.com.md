Countrywide Financial Corporation, a national leader with more than 30 years of trusted experience in the home loan industry, offers a wide range of financial products and services through our family of companies.  
   
A guide to protecting your privacy  
The purpose of this section is to explain how the Countrywide family of companies protects and uses your personal information when and after you obtain financial products or services from us. We want you to know that information given to us is safe, secure and used in a responsible manner. 

To offer you all the greatest advantages as a Countrywide customer, we find that sharing limited amounts of your personal information within our Countrywide family of companies and with well-respected, carefully selected business partners enables us to offer you personalized products and services at lower costs and/or much greater convenience than otherwise would be possible.  
  
   
Your protection is our priority  
  
 We use advanced data-encryption and storage technology to protect your sensitive personal information. Also, most of our companies benefit from membership in recognized online privacy and security organizations such as [TruSecure](http://www.trusecure.com/)®[Corporation](http://www.trusecure.com/) and [VeriSign Inc.](http://www.verisign.com/about/index.html)

We implemented extensive administrative, technical and physical safeguards and quality controls. These include:

  * Setting policies and procedures for carefully handling your information 
  * Limiting physical access to central facilities through the use of guard personnel and state-of-the-art security systems 
  * Maintaining a database across the Countrywide family of companies to honor our customers' privacy preferences 
  * Requiring third-party business partners to agree contractually to comply with privacy laws to do business with Countrywide 
  * Auditing company security practices 



Clearly stated policies in our employee handbooks, background checks on all employees and thorough on-the-job training in confidentiality and customer privacy ensure that our employees are committed to keeping your personal information safe and secure

Use of cookies | Back to top  
  
Unlike some companies, we designed many features of our site to let new visitors anonymously learn about our financial products and services, view today’s rates and use our educational tools without revealing their identities. For these new visitors, the only information we collect online is from cookies, pixel tags or similar devices, which provide limited data, such as the date, time and areas of our site that were visited, interactions with the site, and the Web path/domain where the visitor came from. This general information enables us to serve customers better by continually improving our Web site, making it more convenient, and improving our Internet marketing efforts. When you go online and select one of our financial products or services, log in to review your accounts, or respond to our marketing materials sent directly to you, we will try to identify your browser and may combine information from cookies, pixel tags or other similar devices with other information you have provided to us and other data we maintain about you. We do this to better serve your financial needs and make your online experience more convenient.

Cookies are Required to operate the Your Accounts feature

It is possible to disable cookies on your Web browser. If you do so, it is not possible for us to offer you the Your Accounts service for accessing consolidated information online about all your accounts with the Countrywide Financial family of companies.

Benefits to sharing outside the Countrywide family | Back to top  
  
To make products and services available, often at substantial savings to you, we may prudently share some customer and former customer non-public personal information with business partners under an agreement requiring that the information be kept confidential and used only for those offers. Our business partners may have privacy policies which vary from those set forth herein.  
  
   
Information we gather and communicate | Back to top  
In order to provide financial products and services, comply with government regulations, improve our products and services and better understand your financial needs, we collect and maintain a range of customer and former customer data including non-public personal information: 

  * From applications, supporting documents and other forms (such as your phone, Social Security and account numbers, assets, income and employment history) 
  * About your transactions with us, our affiliates and our business partners (such as your loan balance, payment history and other account information) 
  * From a credit reporting agency (such as your credit worthiness and credit history) 
  * From business partners, current or past employees, other financial institutions or vendors and service companies (such as a property appraisal, income information, purchase contract or membership number) 



We are periodically required to disclose some of this data to third parties, such as credit reporting agencies, title and insurance carriers, federal and state regulators and loan investors, in order to do business with you. We may also share all of this information with companies that perform services on our behalf (such as the vendors who prepare our monthly statements or provide ATM access to your accounts). These business partners contractually agree to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose.

Additional, in order to provide you with valuable product and service offers, we share limited amounts of this non-public personal information (such as a list of customers in a certain income range) within our Countrywide family of companies and with well-respected business partners who are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your information.   
  
   
You have choices | Back to top  
  
Because we respect your right to privacy, we give you the choice of how your personal information may be shared. You may choose to

  1. Allow Countrywide to share limited amounts of your personal information within and outside the Countrywide family of companies, 
  2. Limit information sharing outside the Countrywide family of companies, or 
  3. Limit information sharing with the Countrywide family of companies. 

  
The process of limiting our ability to share your information is called "opting out." 

We provide you three different options to consider, and have a strong commitment to honor your request. They are to:

  * Continue receiving valuable and convenient product and service offers

No action is required if you want to enjoy the benefits of valuable product and service offers by allowing Countrywide to share limited amounts of your personal information within and outside the Countrywide family of companies. 



  * Opt out of information sharing outside the Countrywide family of companies

Making this decision will prevent us from sharing non-public, personal information with our well-respected, carefully screened business partners. This choice may limit our ability to inform you of valuable and convenient products and services from partner companies.

  * Opt out of information sharing within the Countrywide family of companies

Making this decision will prevent us from sharing non-public, personal information within the Countrywide family of companies. This choice may limit our ability to offer conveniences such as a tailored savings quote on homeowners insurance, a custom financial investment plan, other financial service offers and more.

Some state laws already require us to maintain more restrictive practices for sharing information. For state specific information, visit the appropriate business segment by clicking on one of the tabs at the top of our Home Page or review the information when you obtain one of our products or services. 




  
For loans to multiple borrowers, we will treat an opt out by any borrower as applying to all borrowers on the loan. Please be aware that even if you decide to opt out, Countrywide will continue to share non-public personal information with companies that perform services on our behalf (such as the vendor who prepares our monthly statements) and with third parties as otherwise required or permitted by law (such as to credit reporting agencies or regulators), as well as share transactions and experience (such as your loan balance or payment history) within the Countrywide family of companies.

During the application process, you'll be provided with a privacy notice that includes a toll-free phone number to call if you decide to exercise either of the opt out choices. Or, if you have any questions about our privacy policy, please send an email message to: : [privacypolicy@countrywide.com](mailto:privacypolicy@countrywide.com)

In today's ever-changing, competitive market, opting out may mean missing timely information about money-saving products and services that help you accomplish your homeownership or other financial goals. It's something to think about carefully. We don't want you to miss out on any opportunities.

| About Internet Security  
|  | How Does Browser Security Work? | Back to top  
---|---  
Recent versions of most internet browsers support the encrypted transmission of on-line documents and the data you enter on a web page. This means that instead of sending readable text, both your browser and the web site's secure server encode all text using a security key. That way, personal data sent to your browser or data you send back would be extremely difficult to decode in the unlikely event it was intercepted by an unauthorized party. The key used for encoding is a random number that is unique to your session at the secure web site. 

There are two grades of internet security: International-grade encryption uses a 40-bit random number negotiated between your browser and the web-server. This means that only one out of about 1,000,000,000,000 possible decoding keys can be used to decipher your data. Domestic-grade encryption uses a 128-bit key, so that the number of possible keys is vastly larger. The Countrywide site uses the highest grade of encryption supported by your browser and your internet connection.   
  
   
How Do I Know If Security is Operating? | Back to top  
Your internet session is encrypted if your security-enabled browser is connected to a web site using the Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol. URL strings beginning with "HTTPS://" instead of the usual "HTTP://" indicate that the secure protocol is in effect. Your browser may also tell you if security is operating. For example, Netscape Navigator may display the  icon in the lower left corner of your screen in secure mode. If 128-bit security is in effect, it shows the  icon. Microsoft Internet Explorer shows a  icon in either case. Note that security may be operating without any visible indication if the web page you are viewing employs frames (see below). 

If secure transmission is not in effect or only part of a frame-based page is secure, Netscape shows the "broken key"  icon, and Explorer does not show the "lock" icon. 

Most browsers can be set to give you a pop-up announcement when you enter or leave a secure web page. In Netscape, these settings are on the Security Preferences "General" tab. In IE, the setting is on the "Advanced" tab when you select "Options" on the View menu.   
  
   
Secure Mode and Frame-Based Web Pages | Back to top  
Security may be operating without displaying any security icons (or Netscape may show the "broken key" icon) if only part of a frame-based page is employing security. You can verify the security of page within a frame by opening it in a new browser window. Both IE and Netscape allow you to open a link in a new window by right-clicking on the link and selecting that option from the pop-up context menu. When a secure page is open in its own window, instead of being viewed within a frame, you can then see the security icons provided by your browser as well as the "https://" secure protocol prefix in the URL string.

---|---  
When you visit a site, a file called a “cookie” may be saved to your computer’s hard drive during your visit. When you revisit the site, the Web site’s server may open the cookie file and access the stored information. You can set your browser to limit or let you know about cookies that a Web site places on your computer.   
   
Pixel tags and Third-Party cookies | Back to top  
A pixel tag is a graphic on a Web page or in an email message that is designed to monitor whether the Web page or email message is read or clicked. Pixel tags are often invisible because they are very small in size, typically 1-by-1 pixels. Pixel files are also used for alignment purposes on Web pages of many Web sites. We sometimes use pixel tags to provide an independent accounting of how many people visit our Web sites or to gather statistics about browser usage at our Web sites. It is difficult for you to limit the use of pixel tags because there is no easy method of distinguishing pixel tags from alignment pixel files. A pixel tag may be loaded from a different Web server than the rest of the page.

We sometimes use third party as serving companies to serve our internet ad banners on our site and other sites on which we advertise. If you click on one of those ads, you can go to one of the Countrywide Financial sites offering that particular product or service. These ads contain small graphics with “tags” to tell us how many people responded to our ads. They do not identify you personally. The companies that distribute our ads are prohibited by contract from using information other than for the agreed upon purpose – to help us market our products and services and to measure response rates.   
  
   
Similar Devices | Back to top  
For example, we include unique URLs in email marketing materials sent directly to you (such as special offers) so that we can identify that it is you responding to the campaign and provide details on the offer available to you.
