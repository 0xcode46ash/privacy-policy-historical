# Counsyl | Privacy policy

## Privacy and Security Policy

Welcome to Counsyl! We are a technology company that strives to give millions of men and women access to vital information about their bodies to help them confidently make choices about their lives. There are three policies that govern the Counsyl website and products:

  * This **Privacy and Security Policy** describes our information handling practices when you access our website located at [www.counsyl.com](https://web.archive.org/) (the "Site"), and/or when you use any Counsyl products or services, (referred to collectively hereinafter as the "Service" or "Services");
  * Our **Notice of Privacy Practices** which describes our practices specifically regarding medical and payment information; and
  * Our **Terms of Service** which applies to use of the Site and our Services.



Please read this Privacy Policy and the other Policies carefully. By visiting this Site or using any of our Services, you are agreeing to them. If you cannot agree, please do not use the Services.

### Why do we collect information?

We cannot perform our services without collecting information from you. For example, we receive information from you when we (1) accept your order for a screen, (2) contact your healthcare professional for authorization, (3) pre-verify your insurance coverage (if possible), (4) receive payment and (5) schedule appointments with medical profesisonals.

Some of this information is **Personally Identifying Information** ("PII"), which is information that can be used on its own or with other data to identify you personally. Examples of PII include: name, address, email address, phone number, social security number or credit card number. We also collect **Protected Health Information** ("PHI"), which is information that indicates the past, present or future health status of an individual. Examples of PHI can include your name associated with your family medical history or genetic screen results.

Whether the data is your PII or your PHI, we take its protection seriously. We employ rigorous technical and organizational safeguards against unauthorized disclosure or access to all information, consistent with the standards established in the Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act of 1996 ("HIPAA").

### What information does Counsyl collect and how is it used?

Counsyl only collects information that assists us to effectively provide you with the Services that you have requested of us.

  1. In order to permit you to access our website and services via the internet, we collect industry standard log data that includes the type of browser and operating system you are using, the address of the external or internal page that referred you, and your IP address. This information is collected from every visitor and is used to diagnose Site performance and usability.

  2. You will need a user account to request that we send your doctor information about authorizing our Service or to to access test results that were previously ordered by your physician. To create a user account you must provide us with your name, email address, phone number and password. We use this information to create your account, verify your identify, and to communicate with you. Our email communications with you are often transactional or relationship messages, such as communications about billing, genetic counseling appointments, screen results or other Service-related notifications. You may not be able to opt out of receiving certain Service-related messages. If you sign up to receive marketing or informational announcements from us, such emails will include capability to opt-out of receiving such e-mails in the future.

  3. If you are accessing screen results from a previous interaction with Counsyl, we will request your date of birth and the cell phone number listed when you initially requested the screen. We will send you a text message with a verification code. We use these two factors to verify your identity.

  4. When you order a test, you will need to provide us with either with credit card payment or health insurance information, a shipping address, the name and location of your physician and relevant personal and family medical history. We use this information to process payment by credit card or by insurance carrier; to send the test kit to you; to acquire authorization from your physician and to assist us in providing a comprehensive genetic report.

  5. If you contact us via a form on the Site, for example, to request an appointment with a genetic counselor or to request financial aid, we require those fields because they are relevant to providing you with the assistance that you are requesting. We will only use this information in relation to the purpose for which you are providing it.




### How does Counsyl secure my information?

We understand how important your privacy is, which is why we take great care in safeguarding your personal information. Counsyl employs a range of physical, technical and administrative safeguards to secure the information you entrust to us and protect it from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Information you provide to Counsyl through our website is encrypted using industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, and your protected health information is processed and stored behind firewalls on controlled servers with restricted access. In addition, Counsyl limits our employees’ and contractors’ access to your protected health information. Only properly authorized employees and contractors with a valid purpose for accessing your information have such access. Counsyl information security governance is aligned with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and also meets the requirements and guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and College of American Pathologists (CAP). Counsyl does not store any credit card information, and is compliant with PCI data security standards.

Please recognize that you play a vital role in protecting your own personal information. When registering on the Counsyl site, it is important to choose a password of sufficient length and complexity, to not reveal this password to any third parties, and to immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized access to your account. Counsyl will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited call or an unsolicited email. We may ask you to confirm personal identifiers when registering an account or requesting support, which we use in conjunction with other security measures — such as email verification — to confirm your identity and safeguard your personal information.

### Will you share any of my information?

We will keep your information private. We will never sell your information. We will only share your information if we receive your consent, or in the following circumstances:

  1. We contract with third-party vendors to provide services that are necessary to the Site. These vendors are required by contract and in some cases, state and/or federal law, to protect the information we share with them and may only use it for that purpose. **Example:** We partner with stripe.com to process credit card payment information. Stripe has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor, and is certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1. This is the most stringent level of certification available.

  2. We may disclose your PII or PHI if we believe, after due consideration, that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or valid legal process. If we are going to release your information, we will do our best to provide you with notice in advance, unless we are prohibited by court order from doing so.

  3. We may also disclose your PII to address fraud, security, or spam; to comply with a legal duty to inform others, such as if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person or to protect our rights or property.

  4. Even if we are acquired by or merged with another company, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to information collected while it was in place.
