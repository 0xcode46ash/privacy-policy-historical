Thanks for visiting! We want to assure you that your privacy is safe with us at Country Outfitter. This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personal information that this site gathers when you access or use our online store. For details, keep reading.

## Information We Collect

### Our visitors - Automatic Data Collection

Like most websites, countryoutfitter.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use this website. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of this website.

Country Outfitter also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We do not use such information to identify our visitors, however, and do not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that we use and disclose personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Our customers - Information You Provide to Us

Certain actions on our website do require us to collect personally-indentifying information. Purchasers are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process transactions. In each case, Country Outfitter collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with our company. We will never disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. 

### Aggregated Statistics

Country Outfitter may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Country Outfitter may monitor the most popular sections or products on our site. Country Outfitter may display this non-personally-identifying information publicly or provide it to others. However, Country Outfitter does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Country Outfitter discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide services requested by the customer, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using CountryOutfitter.com, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. **Country Outfitter will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.** Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Country Outfitter discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Country Outfitter, third parties or the public at large. Country Outfitter takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Without cookies Country Outfitter can't keep track of the items you've placed in your cart or perform other crucial ecommerce capabilities. We do not use cookies to intrude in your privacy or do anything other than match you up with your information on our site.
