## Information VitalSource collects about you

VitalSource collects information from you when you download, access or use any of the Products, register with VitalSource, create a user account for our Bookshelf e-reader or visit any of our websites, as described further below. This information falls into two categories: personal data and non-personal data (collectively "Information"). 

Personal data includes information that identifies you specifically or from which you are reasonably identifiable. The types of personal data we collect may include your name, address, email address, phone number, other contact information, employer, academic institution, course information, and credit or debit card numbers. 

Non-personal data is anonymous data that does not identify you specifically, such as aggregate data about the number of people who have accessed a particular Product.

You can choose not to provide personal data we may request of you, but, in general, most of the personal data we request is required in order to provide our service and the lack of such personal data will prevent us from doing so. We will collect, use, transfer and disclose your personal data only in ways that are consistent with this Privacy & Cookies Policy, but we may collect, use, transfer and disclose non-personal data for any lawful purpose. 

We collect personal data directly from you as well as from third parties including public sources, our related companies, your organization, your representatives, information service providers, social media and the parties with whom we exchange Information as described here.

  * facts about your purchases,
  * how you use the Products,
  * the specific Products you use,

Your institution may wish to see, for example, that you have accessed and used a certain Product or certain of its contents, or spent a certain amount of time using it. This Information may be used to help your institution evaluate your progress and improve your learning. By using one of these codes, you agree to VitalSource sharing usage Information with your institution in this way.

VitalSource has security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse, or alteration of your Information. Our secure server software is among the best software systems available for secure Internet payment transactions. It encrypts your payment information to seek to ensure it is not intercepted as it travels over the Internet. Submission of Information over the Internet, however, is never entirely secure. Despite its reasonable efforts, VitalSource cannot guarantee that unauthorized access or disclosure of Information will never happen. If you have concerns, do not use the Products. 

It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal data if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.
