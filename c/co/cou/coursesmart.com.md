# VitalSource Technologies, Inc. Privacy & Cookies Policy – Bookshelf Support

This Privacy & Cookies Policy (“Policy”) explains VitalSource Technologies, Inc.’s (“VitalSource,” also “we,” “our,” and “us”) information practices related to any of our websites (such as [www.vitalsource.com](http://www.vitalsource.com/)), any VitalSource owned web retail store, our products known as Bookshelf, Bookshelf Online, Bookshelf mobile applications, reader software, digital content, other products controlled or owned by VitalSource, and any other products or services located on websites that include a link to this Policy (collectively, the “Products”). You agree to the terms of this Policy when you access or use any of the Products or websites, or take other actions described below.

**Information VitalSource collects about you**

VitalSource collects information from you when you download, access or use any of the Products, register with VitalSource, create an account for our Bookshelf e-reader or any other of our services, or visit any of our websites, as described further below. This information falls into two categories: information you provide directly to us and information that we passively or automatically collect, such as from your browser or device (collectively “Information”).

**Information You Provide Directly to Us**

We may collect Information from you when you access or use the Products, such as when you: create an account, make a purchase, download content, input user-generated content, including notes and highlights in books, participate in assessments, and share information with friends. The types of Information we collect may include your name, address, email address, phone number, other contact information, employer, academic institution, course information, credit or debit card numbers, and user-generated content such as notes, highlights, and responses to assessments.

You can choose not to provide such Information, but, in general, most of the Information we request from you is required in order for us to provide the Products and the lack of such Information will prevent us from doing so. We will collect, use, transfer and disclose this Information as described in this Policy. We may collect, use, transfer and disclose aggregate or de-identified information without any restriction.

**Information We Receive From Third-Parties**

We may receive similar Information from third parties including public sources, our related companies, your organization, your representatives, information service providers, social media and the parties with whom we exchange Information as described here.

**Information That Is Automatically Collected**

VitalSource also automatically collects certain Information as you use the Products, make Product purchases and interact with us. This Information includes, but is not limited to:

  * facts about your purchases,
  * how you use the Products,
  * the specific Products you use,
  * the specific parts of the Products you use,
  * analytical data created when you view the Products, create new notes, or view previous notes on any device,
  * activities you engaged in, such as your searches and other transactions,
  * information about page views, page usage, time on page, and other information about usage,
