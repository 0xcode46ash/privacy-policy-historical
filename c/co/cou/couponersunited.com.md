Couponers United is a personal blog written and edited by Mary Edwards. As the owner of Couponers United, I do accept forms of cash advertising, sponsorship and free products. I do receive compensation however all opinions are 100% mine. I always give my own honest opinions & experiences on products or services. As well as accepting sponsorship, I also turn down offers from companies or services that I do not believe in or stand behind! I do not endorse products that I donâ€™t trust or believe in.

This being said, any product claim or statistic should be verified with the manufacturer or provider in question.
