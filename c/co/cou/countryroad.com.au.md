We recommend you read through this policy carefully. If you have any queries, please Contact Us.

Personal information collected from customers will depend on the type of service provided.

**CARDHOLDER PROGRAM AND OFFER COMMUNICATIONS**

Our Cardholder Program offers customers the opportunity to receive rewards such as invitations to sales events, special offers, gift vouchers and the delivery of marketing communications. Customers may also receive information and related offers via email.

To receive communications from us, certain personal information is required. We use this information to facilitate communication with and understand the needs of our customers as well as conduct customer research. Other optional information collected may be used to plan future events, offers, products, store locations etc.

Any information collected will be safely and securely stored and managed by us.

We value our customers and do not share information with any other organisations other than related corporations and those third parties directly related with the above activities (i.e. mailing houses, data bureaus, email providers and research companies). When we share any such information with these third parties we have strict confidentiality agreements in place, prohibiting any use of this information other than the task for which we are engaging them.

**HEAD OFFICE**

Information collected at Head and Regional Offices will be generated in a number of ways, including:

  * Employment applications and resumes
  * Trade references
  * Contract arrangements
  * Staff travel arrangements



Any information collected is safely and securely stored and only used for the purposes for which it was collected.

**GENERAL**

We may share some of the personal information we collect with our related corporations and service providers, contractors who help us provide services or trading partners. Where applicable information is shared with third parties or trading partners we have strict confidentiality agreements in place, prohibiting any use of this information other than the purpose for which it was provided. We may be required by law to disclose the information collected. In such circumstances, only information that we are required to disclose as a matter of law would be provided.

We would like to assure you that personal information will not be divulged except as set out above.

**WEBSITE AND CREDIT CARD SECURITY**

We take website and credit card security extremely seriously and always endeavour to

provide a secure, safe platform from which to conduct online transactions. Country Road (countryroad.com.au and m.countryroad.com.au) and Trenery (trenery.com.au and m.trenery.com.au) use the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts information as it is transmitted over the internet. This encryption scrambles details such as credit card numbers, billing details and delivery addresses so that other computers are unable to decipher the information, ensuring privacy and security.

To ensure you are accessing a secure server, look for the unbroken key or closed lock symbol located either at the bottom left or top right of your browser window. If it appears, then SSL is active. You can double-check by looking at the URL. If SSL is active, then the first characters of the URL will read ‘https’ rather than just ‘http.’ It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and your computer. Ensure you log out when you have finished visiting Country Road (countryroad.com.au and m.countryroad.com.au) and Trenery (trenery.com.au and m.trenery.com.au).

Our websites use cookies, enabling us to improve the content, reliability and functionality of our websites, evaluate the effectiveness of advertising and track usage patterns. Accepting a cookie will not give us access to any data on your computer other than the data stored in the cookie. You may experience a loss of functionality as a result of configuring your web browser not to accept cookies.

**LINKING TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITE**

When you click on links and banners on our website that take you to third-party websites, you will be subject to their privacy policies. While we support the protection of privacy on the internet, Country Road cannot be held responsible for the actions of any third-party websites.

**ACCESSING YOUR ONLINE INFORMATION**

Personal information provided by you online can be viewed and changed if the information provided is incorrect or out of date. If you still have questions, please Contact Us.

**HOW TO ACCESS YOUR INFORMATION**

Our 'open book' information policy means you can access all the information you have provided to us online and make any necessary changes. You can request to view your information in writing to Country Road Customer Service or by contacting us on 1800 801 911 (Australia) or 0800 105 655 (New Zealand). We welcome your feedback to correct any inaccuracies.

**SECURITY**

We understand the importance of your information and we treat it as strictly confidential. We have appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures in place to safeguard and secure the information we collect to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of information.

**YOUR RIGHTS**

While information is sought from you for the sole purpose of improving our service levels, you have the right to either refuse to provide details about yourself or remain anonymous. Of course, some of our services can only be provided if we have certain information. If you are not completely satisfied with anything set out in this privacy policy, you are entitled to either query this practice or lodge a complaint with our Privacy Officer or the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. All such enquiries or complaints will be handled with impartiality and discretion.

Your information may also be used for the purpose of introducing other products that we believe might be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive such communications you may opt out by selecting the "opt out" options available on our website.
