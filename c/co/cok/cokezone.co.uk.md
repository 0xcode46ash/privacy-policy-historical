### Personal Data

Coca-Cola Great Britain will not collect any personally-identifiable information about you (e.g., your name, address, date of birth, telephone number or email address ("personal data") through our websites unless you have provided it to us voluntarily. If you do not want your personal data collected, please do not submit it to us.

Coca Cola will not use any personally-identifiable information about you which is obtained through our website, for direct marketing and advertising purposes unless you have indicated your agreement to this use by ticking that you "opt-in" and consent to receiving marketing and advertising updates from us when you register with the [www.cokezone.co.uk](http://www.cokezone.co.uk/) website. Coca-Cola will only collect and use your personal data in strict compliance with countries of NWEN data protection laws.

Coca-Cola Great Britain takes the protection of data seriously. Our database is hosted in the USA and we implement similar safeguards as required by European standards.

When you do provide us with personal data, we may use that information in the following ways, unless stated otherwise:

  * we may store and process that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services;
  * we (or a fulfilment house or other third party on our behalf in connection with a promotion) may use that information to contact you;
  * and/or we may provide other third parties with summary - but not individual - information about visitors to or users of our sites.
  * where you are a winner in a promotion or competition available at [www.cokezone.co.uk](http://www.cokezone.co.uk/) we may provide a list of the names of winners and their country of residence on request. We may use your first and last name on our blog to announce to our other members the winners of a prize.
  * utilising the Facebook Connect and log in buttons on the Coke Zone site to either register or log in will share data using Facebook API. Coke Zone will try to access the following fields from your Facebook profile: Facebook User ID, First Name, Email, Date of Birth, Gender, Hometown and Current city. In case your privacy settings do not allow us to access this information, you will be able to provide it on a separate form. You do not need to modify your Facebook privacy settings to use this feature. These fields will be saved on Coke Zone's system and will not be shared with any third party. Once retrieved, Coke Zone will neither access this information again nor attempt to keep it in sync and Coke Zone will not accept any information sent by Facebook. You will have to make any change to your private information separately on Facebook and Coke Zone (via updates on the 'My Account' section). If we have retrieved the data via Facebook, Coke Zone relies on the data you have provided to Facebook and by agreeing to the terms and conditions you confirm that this data is accurate. Facebook operates its own set of terms and conditions and privacy policy which are separate to the ones presented above. On completion of registration on Coke Zone using Facebook Connect a generic Coke Zone registration message will be posted to your profile. Your friends will be able to see this message.

### Children

Parents should be aware that Coca-Cola Great Britain's Privacy Policy will govern our use of personal data, but that information which is voluntarily given by children - or others - in chat sessions, email exchanges, bulletin boards or the like may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited mail. Coca-Cola Great Britain encourages all parents to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of their personal data while using the Internet.

Coca-Cola requires the prior consent of a parent or guardian of a child who registers with its website. Where Coca-Cola is notified by a parent that they have not given consent to their child's use of 'Coke Zone' it will ensure that the child's account is immediately terminated and all information and data provided by this child will be immediately deleted.
