# Privacy Policy - College of Charleston

### BACKGROUND

This Policy and Procedure governs the security and confidentiality of personal information entrusted to the care of College of Charleston (“College”) to carry out its mission and to certain other sensitive information that is generated and owned by the College. This Policy and Procedure also establishes the principles and processes by which that information will be maintained and managed.

### PURPOSE

The _South Carolina Family Privacy Protection Act_ provides, in relevant part:

> § 30-2-20. Privacy policies and procedures required of all state entities.
> 
> All state agencies, boards, commissions, institutions, departments, and other state entities, by whatever name known, must develop privacy policies and procedures to ensure that the collection of personal information pertaining to citizens of the State is limited to such personal information required by any such agency, board, commission, institution, department, or other state entity and necessary to fulfill a legitimate public purpose.

Implementation and adherence to this Policy and Procedure are necessary to comply with the cited statute and to provide for the protection of sensitive information that is maintained or owned by the College.

The specific purposes of this Policy and Procedure are:

  * To establish a College-wide approach to information security.
  * To prescribe mechanisms that help identify and prevent the compromise of information security and the misuse of data, applications, networks and computer systems.
  * To define mechanisms to protect the reputation of the College and allow the College to satisfy its legal and ethical responsibilities to others.
  * To prescribe an effective mechanism for responding to external complaints and queries about real or perceived non-compliance with this Policy and Procedure.
  * To further reduce the risk of exposure and identity theft when a Social Security Number or other personal identifying information is used by the College as a primary identifier and to provide for the consistent, proper and secure management of such information.



### SCOPE

This Policy and Procedure is applicable to all members of the College Community including our faculty, staff, students, visitors and contractors who have access to College records regardless of the medium in which those records are stored or where they are located.

### SOUTH CAROLINA FAMILY PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT[1]

State law requires the College to develop privacy policies and procedures to ensure that the collection of personal information pertaining to citizens of the State is limited to such personal information as may be required by the College to fulfill its public purpose.[2]

The College is also required, as a state entity, to clearly display its Privacy Policy on its web page, along with the name and telephone number of the College’s designee who is “responsible for administration of the policy.”[3] This Policy and Procedure will be included, therefore, on the College’s web site.

When personal information is authorized to be collected by a College Operating Unit, and when that information is subject to disclosure under the _Freedom of Information Act_[4], the operating Unit must, at the time of collection, advise the citizen to whom the information pertains that the information is subject to public scrutiny or release under the _Freedom of Information Act_. Forms that may be used for such purpose are attached hereto and marked as Appendix A.

Upon request, the Unit shall inform the individual whether the disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, the statutory or other authority under which the College is soliciting the number, and what uses will be made of the number. A subsequent request for production of a Social Security Number for verification purposes dealing with that same usage does not require the provision of another notice. Except for good cause that is documented in the appropriate file, the notice required under this subsection (a), if requested, shall be in writing (see Appendix B).
> 
> (b) Systems of records containing Social Security Numbers or other Personal Information shall be maintained for such periods of time as may be required under the College’s _Records Retention Policy_ (<http://recordsretention.cofc.edu/>), except that the Senior Vice President for Legal Affairs may extend such time periods with respect to certain records as may be required to comply with court orders or rules, lawfully issued subpoenas or other compulsory process, or to otherwise mitigate legal risks to the College.

### 4.0 REQUESTS FOR EMPLOYEE RECORDS UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT[15]

**4.1 Generally**. In response to requests for information from Employee Records, the College may provide an employee's name, date of employment, title, sex, and race.

In addition to making available for public inspection and copying the materials described in this Section 4.4, the College shall disclose, upon request, the number of applicants considered for a position. For the purpose of this section, materials relating to not fewer than the final three applicants, do not include an applicant's income tax returns, medical records, Social Security Number, or information otherwise exempt from disclosure by the _Freedom of Information Act_.[17]

### 5.0 EDUCATION RECORDS

Policies and procedures dealing with the disclosure of education records shall be in accord with the policies of the Office of the Registrar dealing with the implementation of the Federal _Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act_ (20 U.S.C. § 1232g). Those policies and procedures can be found at: [http://www.cofc.edu/~register/FERPA.htm](http://www.cofc.edu/~register/FERPA.htm). Interpretations of the statute and the controlling regulations shall be made by the Office of Legal Affairs, after consultation with the Office of the Registrar, or the Provost, as may be appropriate under the circumstances.

### 6.0 “MEDICAL RECORD” or “HEALTH INFORMATION”

**6.1 Disclosure**. Medical Records of employees and students may only be released or shared in accordance with the provisions of the _South Carolina Physicians' Patient Records Act_ (S.C. Code Ann. § 44-115-10 et seq.), _the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act_ , and such other provisions of state or federal law as may be applicable.

**6.2 Interpretations**. The South Carolina _Physicians' Patient Records Act_ (S.C. Code Ann. § 44-115-10 et seq.) states in part:

> _Except as otherwise provided by law_ , a physician shall not honor a request for the release of copies of medical records without the receipt of express written consent of the patient or person authorized by law to act on behalf of the patient. (§ 44-115-40) ( _emphasis supplied_ )

For the purposes of this Policy and Procedure, the College will afford any licensed health care provider within the employ of the College the same protection afforded a “physician” under the above cited statute. The term “Except as otherwise provided by law” shall be subject to interpretation by the College’s Senior Vice President for Legal Affairs.

**6.3 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”)**. While neither the College nor any Unit of the College is currently subject to HIPAA, the College may elect, in the exercise of its discretion, to utilize such forms dealing with the disclosure or release of Medical Records as may be compliant with HIPAA.

### 7.0 DISPOSAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES CONTAINING PROTECTED INFORMATION[18]

**7.1 Hardware and Storage Media.** Before a College Unit may transfer or dispose of information technology hardware or storage media, all Protected Information must be removed and the hardware and storage media must be sanitized in accordance with the standards and policies adopted by the Chief Information Officer (“CIO”). The CIO shall verify that all Protected Information is removed and the information technology hardware and storage media are sanitized in accordance with those standards and policies before the transfer or disposal occurs.

**7.2 Records.** When a College Unit disposes of a record that contains Protected Information the Unit shall modify, by shredding, erasing, or other means, the Protected Information to make it unreadable or undecipherable. The College Unit is considered to comply with this requirement if it uses a College retained contractor who is engaged by the College and who is in the business of disposing of such records.

### 8.0 ETHICS

**8.1 Self Dealing.** An employee of the College may not use or disclose Protected Information gained in the course of or by reason of that person’s official responsibilities in a way that would affect an economic interest held by that person, a member of that person’s immediate family, or an individual or business with whom that person is associated.

**8.2 Misuse of Records.** An employee of the College may not willfully examine, or aid and abet in the willful examination of a workers’ compensation record, a record in connection with health or medical treatment, social services records, Employee Record, Education Record, or other records of an individual in the possession of or within the access of the College if the purpose of the examination is improper or unlawful.  

### 9.0 RESPONSIBILITIES

**9.1 Passwords**. Passwords help protect against misuse of data systems and networks by restricting the use of those systems and networks to authorized users. Each authorized user of such a system may be assigned or may be asked to develop a unique password that is to be protected by that individual and not shared with others, is difficult to determine, is changed on a regular basis, and is deleted when no longer authorized.

**9.2 Security**. Individual users are responsible for ensuring that others do not use their system privileges. In particular, users must take great care in protecting their usernames and passwords from eavesdropping, loss or careless misplacement. Passwords are never to be 'loaned.' Individual users will be held responsible for any security violations associated with their username or passwords.

**9.3 Access Policies of Data Systems**. Each user permitted to access a system containing Protected Information shall be made aware of the access policy for that system. Management will provide this information to the employee when first granting access and make the employee aware of the auditing capability in place to verify compliance.

**9.4 Collection of Protected Information**. As Protected Information is developed or compiled, the individual(s) responsible for the development or collection of the data are responsible for assuring that storage and access of the data is appropriately managed.

**9.5 Audit of Systems Containing Protected Information**. Information Technology operations staff are responsible for reviewing the logs and identifying potential security violations. The IT operations staff is responsible for establishing the security and access control mechanisms (such as usernames, passwords, logging protocols) and may be held accountable for any security breaches that arise from improper configuration of these mechanisms. If the application is housed outside of IT, the application administrator must be in a position to fulfill these requirements and document the same in writing.

### 10.0 PROTECTED INFORMATION STORED ON COMPUTING DEVICES[19]

**10.1 Generally.** Protected Information that resides on a College user's computer or a portable computer or portable storage device must be secure at all times. The theft or loss of a portable computer or portable storage device must not put Protected Information at risk of unauthorized disclosure. In addition, Protected Information shall not be maintained at all, if to do so would violate the College’s records retention policy dealing with the length of time such records should be maintained (see [http://recordsretention.cofc.edu/](http://recordsretention.cofc.edu/)).

**10.2 Consultation with IT**. Members of the College community who have a legitimate business or educational need to take Protected Information off campus in the form of a portable electronic device shall consult with the College Chief Information Officer or his/her designee for the nature and type of protection that shall be afforded such Information.

### 11.0 USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES

The College does not randomly monitor the content of personal e-mails, downloads, or other on-line communications or data transmissions that pass through, are resident on, or that otherwise use the College’s IT resources. The College, however, reserves the right to examine its computer records, or to monitor activities of individual computer users of the College IT system, if it has a reasonable belief that such action is needed to: (a) protect the integrity or security of the computing resources; (b) protect the College from incurring liability; (c) investigate unusual or excessive activity typically associated with illegal or illicit activity; (d) investigate reasonably suspected violations of law or College policy; or (e) comply with law or compulsory legal process (such as a lawfully issued subpoena). All such actions must be reviewed and pre-approved by the Senior Vice President of Legal Affairs who shall consult with the President or the appropriate Executive Vice President, as the circumstances may warrant.

### 12.0 INTERNET AND EMAIL ACCESS

**12.1 Vulnerability of Systems; Transmissions**.Protected Information shall not be saved on any computer directly accessible from the Internet or from “open” portions of the College’s internal network unless a user is first duly authorized to access such open portions. Users should clearly understand that many common systems, such as normal email, cannot be considered a secure way to transport confidential information. If it is necessary to transmit Protected Information electronically to a point external to the College, prior consultation should take place with the Office of the CIO.

**12.2 Web Based Surveys and Other Data Collection Tools**.Data collection tools, such as web based surveys that request Confidential Information, must ensure that responses cannot be accessed by unauthorized persons and that Personal Information is not improperly disclosed or shared. If a College vendor is involved in conducting the survey or analyzing results that include Confidential Information that can be linked to individuals, a contract must be in place that protects the Protected Information.

### 13.0 SECURITY BREACHES

Every member of the College community who reasonably believes that a Security Breach has occurred is under an affirmative obligation to report that Breach as soon as practicable to the Office of the CIO and the Office of Legal Affairs. The Security Breach shall be assigned a preliminary level of severity appropriate to the potential of the Breach to result in identity theft, invasions of privacy, and/or economic or other harm to the College. The CIO shall consult with the Senior Vice President of Legal Affairs and privacy Committee regarding all such matters.

### 14.0 COMPLIANCE

**14.1 Consequences for Violations**. All individuals accessing Protected Information are required to comply with federal and state laws and College policies and procedures regarding such Information. Any College employee or student who engages in the unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of data in violation of this Policy and Procedure will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, including possible dismissal and/or legal action. Other persons who may violate this Policy and Procedure, such as a College vendor, may be barred from College property and any further business dealings with the College, as well as, appropriate legal action. The College reserves the right to require anyone having access to Protected Information to first execute a confidentiality agreement approved by the Office of Legal Affairs as a condition for having access to such Information.

**14.2 Responsible Office**.The Office of the CIO shall be responsible for monitoring compliance with this Policy and Procedure and for reporting violations to the appropriate Executive Vice President and to the Office of the Legal Affairs. The Senior Vice President for Legal Affairs shall be responsible for determining if there is reason to believe that any law, rule, or regulation may have been violated.

**Enrollmen** t:

Those wishing to enroll in academic offerings at the College, both credit and non-credit, may be required to provide a SSN to determine lawful presence in the United States. With respect to student employment, IRS regulations require the College to request a SSN as a Taxpayer ID number for use in tax reporting. In addition, any student applying for financial aid may be required to provide a SSN to the College. Historic records may retain a student’s SSN if, for example, the SSN was previously used as the primary identifier for the person who is the subject of that record. However, to the extent practicable, the release of such a record to other than the subject should be preceded by an inquiry with the subject if he/she would prefer if the College redact the SSN from the record.

**Employment** :

A SSN must be provided on Form I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification) in accordance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). SSN’s may also be collected to verify lawful presence in the United States through E-Verify and other acceptable verification sources. Finalist for employment may also be requested to provide a SSN pursuant to the College’s Background Checks Policy. All persons employed by the College must also provide a SSN as the taxpayer ID number. Providing a valid SSN is a condition of employment.

**Employee Benefits** : If required by law or a benefits provider, the SSNs of the employee and the employee’s dependents/beneficiaries may be collected and provided to the service provider.

**Payment for Personal or Professional Services** **; Other Disbursements** : Any person providing services to the College as a contractor, invited speaker or research subject for which payment will be made, may be required to provide a SSN as the taxpayer ID number. These taxpayer ID numbers may be stored in the accounting system as part of the vendor record. In addition, certain other disbursements from the College may require reporting to the Internal Revenue Service. In such an event, these disbursements may be preceded by a request for the SSN or other taxpayer ID number.

**Planned Giving Donors** : Donors to the College participating in planned giving programs must provide a SSN as the taxpayer ID.

**Insurance Providers** : SSNs continue to be the patient identifier for many health care providers. To enable payment of medical bills, and to the extent allowed by law, the SSN of the patient may be shared with the insurance company providing health coverage.

**Third** **-** **Party Sponsors** **of Student Aid** : Various third-party sponsors of student aid, including several state agencies, require the submission of SSNs for those students for which aid is being provided. In order for the sponsor to make payment to the College, a SSN may be requested for proper verification.

**Credit Card Information** : When the College has been paid by credit or debit card, or a declining balance card, the College may maintain the card numbers and related information for a period of time, in accordance with its records retention policy, after the transaction has occurred.

**Student Health Services** : SSN’s or other personal identifying information may be used, as appropriate, as a patient identifier for referrals and consultation with outside medical providers and for communication with insurance companies.

**Public Safety** : Law enforcement personnel may collect or use SSN data to serve a subpoena, conduct an investigation, to make a report, or to make an arrest, as permitted by applicable provisions of state and federal law, rules or regulations. Additionally, Campus Police maintain copies of fingerprint cards for Public Safety employees and others that may contain SSN data and other Personal Information.

**Otherwise Required By Law** **:** As determined by the Senior Vice President for Legal Affairs, Personal Information shall be collected, used and maintained as directed by court order, subpoena or other compulsory legal process, or as otherwise required to protect the legal interests of the College and the College community.
