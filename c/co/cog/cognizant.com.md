Notice

Cognizant Technology Solutions U.S. Corporation and its affiliated companies are firmly committed to protecting your privacy. You should understand what we do with any personal information that you provide to us. That's why we've created this Privacy Policy, which discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices.

Overview 

In general, using our website (cognizant.com) as a site visitor may be considered anonymous: we do not engage in any activity that will personally identify our site visitors.

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website and to refine our site based on which features people use most often. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.

If you are a customer or supplier of ours, we will also use your personal information for the purposes of providing the services or information you or your organization have requested, contacting you about other services or events that may be of interest to you and for other legitimate business purposes, as permitted by applicable laws. 

Any personal information that we have collected or stored about you or that you have provided to us, may be transferred to a future purchaser of our company and/or its assets. 

The data collected via our site is stored in a secure server with our ISP who will take periodic backups of such data but will not give or sell it to anyone else.

Registration

Using cognizant.com does not require registration of any kind other than voluntary registration for white papers, investor kits, alumni correspondence and registration to conferences and netsessions organized by Cognizant. The personal data collected for these purposes will not be sold to anyone outside Cognizant and will be used by Cognizant for one-on-one contact with the registrants. 

Cookies

Cognizant may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons, when a user visits our website. A "cookie" is a small piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system.
