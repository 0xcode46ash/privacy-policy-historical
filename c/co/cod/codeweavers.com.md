CrossOver for Android requests permission to use your device's built-in microphone. CrossOver itself does not use the microphone in any fashion. CrossOver passes access to the microphone through to Windows applications which you install and which need access to this hardware. Neither CodeWeavers nor CrossOver make use of any audio data from your microphone. For the privacy policies of the Windows applications you chose to install, please refer to the vendors which provide those applications.
