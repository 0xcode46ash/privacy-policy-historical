###### 10\. Other Necessary Disclosures

Code42 may sell, transfer, or disclose personal data to business partners as appropriate in accordance with the terms of negotiated agreements for legitimate business purposes. In addition, Code42 may sell, transfer, or disclose personal data to our service providers under negotiated contracts as needed for such service providers to perform services on behalf of Code42. Our business partners and service providers may only use your personal data for the purpose and to fulfill our obligations with the contract terms we have in place with you. Service providers and business partners may not use personal data for any other purposes. If Code42 has knowledge that a business partner or service provider to which it has disclosed your personal data is processing your personal data in a way that is contrary to this Privacy Statement, Code42 will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing. In such case, the service provider or business partner is liable for damages unless it is proven that Code42 is responsible for the event giving rise to the violation.

Code42 may also sell, transfer, or disclose personal data as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of our business. Once information about such a sale or transfer may be shared publicly, Code42 will inform you of the sale, transfer or disclosure of your personal data by a prominent notice on our website(s) and that notice will include information about the handling of your personal data. In the event of a sale, transfer, or disclosure, Code42 will require the recipient of the personal data to protect such data in accordance with applicable law, including the Privacy Shield, and/or otherwise take steps to ensure that personal data is appropriately protected.

###### 11\. Data Security and Integrity

Code42 has global hosting centers that store and process personal data in the United States, Amsterdam, Ireland, Singapore, and Australia. From time-to-time and to meet the demands of our business requirements, Code42 may change the location of our data centers and our service providers with whom we contract.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

**Google Analytics**

The Websites and Products use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies,” which are text files placed on your computer, to help the Website analyze how users use the site. The information collected by Google Analytics, including your internet protocol (IP) address, will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.

Google will use this information on our behalf for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website and Products, compiling reports on Website activity and providing further services to us relating to Website, internet, and Product usage.

You can prevent your data from being collected by Google Analytics on our Websites or Products by downloading and installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on for your current web browser at the following link: <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>.

**Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting**

We may partner with one or more third parties to either display advertising on our Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites.

These sites and third-party ad networks are not controlled by Code42. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising; you will continue to receive generic ads that are not based on your specific interests.

**Analytics / Log Files**

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/ exit pages, operating system, date/ time stamp, and clickstream data. We may use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the Websites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

###### 13\. User Forums

If you use a forum on any of the Websites, you should be aware that any personal data you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

You may remove your post along with your personal data you submit within these forums by contacting us [privacy@code42.com](mailto:privacy@code42.com).

###### 14\. Tell a Friend

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about any of our Websites, we will ask you for your friend’s email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site and download Code42 products. Code42 stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and inviting your friend to use you as backup destination and / or asking your friend’s permission for you to back up to him or her.

###### 15\. Feedback

We may post your feedback concerning our Websites and/or Products on our Websites or on other social media sites.  Such feedback may contain personal information such as the your name, unless otherwise prohibited by our contract with you.  If you wish to remove your feedback, contact us at [privacy@code42.com](mailto:privacy@code42.com).

###### 16\. Survey

We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Websites. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code and company size).

We use third-party service providers for marketing purposes and to conduct surveys or contests. These companies are prohibited from using our participants’ personal data for any other purpose. We will not share the personal data you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties without your express permission.

Information collected by our voluntary third-party surveys is used to market, validate and promote participant utilization of Products and participant opinions of features and benefits of Products and to customize the Website(s). In some cases, with the Customer’s permission, participant feedback collected in surveys is used as testimonial content on our Website(s).

###### 17\. Single Sign-On

You can log in to our [helpdesk.code42.com](https://helpdesk.code42.com/hc/en-us) Website using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal data with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.  Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on the Website(s) to your profile page to share with others within your network.

###### 18\. Support

If you wish to upload a photo of yourself in the support section of a Website, please be aware that this will be viewed by other users of the support section. If you wish to remove your photo you may do so at any time by logging into your support account and editing your profile.

###### 19\. Links to Other Sites

If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave the Website that you are visiting and be redirected to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot (and do not) accept responsibility for any use of your personal data by such third parties, and we cannot (and do not) guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as Code42. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party site that is linked to a Website, you should read that third party site’s privacy statement before providing any personal data.
