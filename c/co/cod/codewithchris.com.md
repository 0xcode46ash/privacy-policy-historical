# Privacy Policy and Affiliate Disclosure

### Introduction

As a reader of many other sites, I understand how important privacy, is especially in this day and age. 

I want to ensure that my readers feel as safe as possible and the information below is full disclosure on what happens on CodeWithChris.com.

Rest assured that I will **never share your information or email with anyone else.**

### Log Files

Like many other websites, CodeWithChris.com uses log files to help learn about when, from where and how often traffic flows to this site. The information in the log files include:

Internet Protocol addresses (IP)  
Types of browser  
Internet Service Provider (ISP)  
Date and time stamp  
Referring and exit pages  
Number of clicks  
All of this information is not linked to anything that is personally identifiable.

### Cookies and web beacons

Like nearly all Websites, CodeWithChris.com stores “convenience” cookies on your computer whenever you leave a comment. These cookies record the name, and email address that you enter when you submit a comment so that you wont have to re-type that information the next time you leave a comment.

Third-party advertisers may also place and read cookies on your browser and/or use web beacons to collect information. CodeWithChris.com has no access or control over these cookies. You should review the respective privacy policies on any and all third-party ad servers for more information regarding their practices and how to opt-out.

If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your web browser options.

Instructions for doing so and for other cookie-related management can be found on the specific web browsers’ websites.

**Amazon**

Amazon, a third party affiliate marketing network, uses cookies to help make sure I get a commission when you buy a product after clicking on a link or ad banner that takes you to the site of one of their merchants. You can read [Amazon’s Privacy Policy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496).

**Google Adsense**

Google Adsense, a third party advertising network, uses cookies to help make sure I get a commission when you buy a product after clicking on a link or ad banner that takes you to the site of one of their merchants. You can read [Google Adsense Privacy Policy](http://support.google.com/adsense/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=48182).

**Google Analytics**

Google Analytics is a web analytics tool I use to help understand how visitors engage with this website. It reports website trends using cookies and web beacons without identifying individual visitors. You can read [Google Analytics Privacy Policy.](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html)

**Google Site Stats**

To measure performance, Google uses small strings of text (known as cookies) that are placed on your computer when you click on ads. Cookies typically remain active on your computer for about 30 days. If you visit certain pages of the advertiser’s website during that period, Google and the advertiser will be able to tell that you saw the ad delivered by Google. You can read more about Google Site Stats [here.](https://services.google.com/sitestats/en_US.html?cid=1060759437)

**Google Remarketing**

We use Google AdWords Remarketing to advertise CodeWithChris across the internet, in particular on the Google Display Network.

AdWords remarketing will display ads to you based on what parts of the CodeWithChris website you have viewed by placing a cookie on your web browser.

This cookie does not in any way identify you or give access to your computer or mobile device.

The cookie is used to indicate to other websites that “This person visited a particular page, so show them ads relating to that page.”

Google AdWords Remarketing allows us to tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and only display ads that are relevant to you.

If you do not wish to see ads from CodeWithChris you can opt out in several ways:  
1\. Opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google’s [Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/settings/ads).  
2\. Opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

**Other**  
Users may choose to receive email updates via MailChimp by submitting an email address to the email subscription form. I use a secure opt-in subscription system and I reserve the right to contact subscribers with information related to this website and blog. Subscribers may unsubscribe anytime and every email delivered will contain an “Unsubscribe” link.

When leaving a comment, users must submit a name and email address. To combat spam, the Disqus commenting platform also records the IP address of anyone submitting a comment.  
Again, none of this information will be shared with anyone.

### Affiliate Disclosure

“CodeWithChris.com is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com, amazonsupply.com, or myhabit.com.”

Unfortunately, that’s some jargon that I had to include in my policy, but let me speak in plain English from here on:

Currently I’m an affiliate with Amazon and a publisher in the Google Adsense program so you may see some of the advertisements on the site and some of the links in my articles or on the Resources page are affiliate links which means that I’ll collect a small percentage of the sale as commission. 

The reason that these are in place is because the small commissions add up and help support the costs to run the site and helps me feed my family without being overly intrusive to my audience’s experience and learning on the site.

These commissions will never come at a cost to yourself and I vow that whether a particular product offers a commission or not, it will never influence my recommendations or teaching material. I know that trust takes a lifetime to build but only seconds to lose, so you can rest assured that I only link to products which I have used personally and would recommend, as a teacher, to my audience for the purpose of learning, building or marketing iOS apps.

With that said, I’d like to sincerely thank you and my readers.

Chris
