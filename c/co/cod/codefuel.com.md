This is the privacy policy (‘Privacy Policy’) for codefuel.com and/or other web sites owned and operated by ClientConnect Ltd. d.b.a. ‘CodeFuel’ (the ‘Website’) that applies to your use of the Website and covers how CodeFuel (‘CodeFuel’ ‘we,’ ‘us,’ or ‘our’) treats information that it collects and receives about you via the Website, including the personal information we collect through the Website regarding the various features, programs, services, and software that CodeFuel provides to you. Some of these offerings are provided by third parties who may provide you with additional information and choices about your privacy. These offerings are subject to the privacy policies of such third parties. We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect and use when you use the Website. This Policy is incorporated into the CodeFuel Website Terms of Use (the ‘Terms’). All capitalized terms that are defined in the Terms, will have the same meaning when used in this Privacy Policy.

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY: BY ACCESSING AND/OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO ACCEPT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, INCLUDING THE COLLECTION, PROCESSING, AND USAGE OF YOUR INFORMATION. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY TERM OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS NOR USE THE WEBSITE.

### Collection of Personally Identifiable Information

CodeFuel does not require Website users or visitors to provide Personally Identifiable Information (‘PII’) to view the content on the Website or to browse the different sections of the Website. PII is information that identifies an individual including, without limitation, full name, postal address, photograph, e-mail address and/or telephone number. CodeFuel may collect PII from Website users or visitors who choose to use and register to the CodeFuel on-line proprietary platform (the ‘CodeFuel Platform’) or other programs, features or services offered by CodeFuel (the ‘Services’). Such PII may include name, email address, address, payment details, etc. Any information CodeFuel collects is collected for the primary purpose of enabling CodeFuel to provide and enhance the Services offered to our users.

You may correct or update certain PII by logging in to your account you opened with CodeFuel and making the change on your personal information page. If you no longer desire our Services or wish to delete or deactivate your account, you can contact us at legal@codefuel.com.

Certain areas of the Website as well as third party websites linked to or accessible from this Website may have different privacy policies and practices. These third parties, and not CodeFuel, are responsible for the privacy practices of such non-CodeFuel websites, or channels or areas of the Website that are operated by third parties, including but not limited to applications and/or features provided by third parties.

During this registration you will be asked to provide a user name, password, valid email address and additional information as may be required as part of the specific service or program which you register to, all of which are used to validate your registration and maintain your account with CodeFuel. You also may provide us with additional information (such as company name, title etc.) so we can provide you with a more customized experience on the Website and offer you better support. CodeFuel may also establish new rules and practices from time to time which may require you to provide additional or different means of identification and authentication in order for you to log in and acces your account, or to access certain features or designated sections of the services. Your log-in details are under your responsibility. You are fully accountable for any use or misuse of your account and personal details as a result of conveying your details to someone else. You must maintain your log-in details in absolute confidentiality and avoid disclosing them to others. Make sure that you change your password frequently and at least once every six months.

From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys or special promotional or other programs on the Website. If you choose to participate, we may request certain PII from you. Participation in such contests or surveys or programs is voluntary and you have a choice whether to provide this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), demographic information (such as zip code), and, in the case of a special program involving a form of payment, payment details. We use this information to notify participants, to monitor Website traffic, customize the Website and send participants email updates.

When you send email or other communications to CodeFuel, we may retain these communications to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.

We provide you with the opportunity to ‘opt–out’ of having your PII used for such purposes when we ask for this information. For example, if you do not wish to receive any additional marketing materials from us, you can indicate your preference on our registration form. If you no longer wish to receive our email updates, you may opt–out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each update or by emailing us at: [support@codefuel.com](mailto:support@codefuel.com).

CodeFuel may disclose PII to any of its affiliates. We require that our affiliates agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

CodeFuel may engage in business relations with third-party companies and offer unique services to clients of such companies within a private label environment. For such purposes, some pages of the Website may be branded with both the CodeFuel brand and the third-party brand. The third party may not use the private label environment to collect any PII. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the pages in the private label environment.

CodeFuel uses third-party service(s) to help it understand how people use the Website. These third parties have their own information collection practices. Please contact us at [support@codefuel.com](mailto:support@codefuel.com) for specific information about these third-party services.

If you entered the Website by clicking an affiliated link or promotion on another Website, or if you used a site that provides universal registration services to sign up for CodeFuel services, we will store the ID of that affiliate site in our database along with your computer’s User ID. We do this to ensure that the affiliate site receives proper credit for any subsequent toolbar or app you may build using our platform.

CodeFuel reserves the right to disclose your PII as required by law and/or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website.

### Use of Cookies and Server Logs

Cookies (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity. ‘Web beacons’ (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising and other data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. The Website and/or other third parties may use ‘cookies’, ‘web beacons’ and other similar information gathering technologies (collectively, ‘Information Gathering Technologies’) to collect non PII automatically as you access and browse the Website. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by CodeFuel only and does not cover the use of cookies by any other third party.

CodeFuel uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. CodeFuel uses session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Website. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You may remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s ‘help’ file. We set a persistent cookie for such uses as to store your toolbar or app name and/or user name so you don’t have to enter it more than once when logging in to the Website. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on the Website. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Website, but your ability to use some areas of the Website may be limited.

By visiting the Website, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to gather information about your use of the Website through these Information Gathering Technologies.

Server logs capture certain non–PII, such as the time and date of a web visit, the browser and operating system being used, the IP address or domain name of the user’s ISP, and the web URL a user linked from. This information is generally but not exclusively used to help plan system enhancements when necessary and to provide content which is compatible with our visitors’ web browsing systems.

In the event that it comes to our knowledge that a person under the age of t eighteen (18) has opened an account on the Website, we will prohibit and block such a user from accessing the Website and/or terminate his account, as applicable and will make all efforts to promptly delete any PII with regard to such a user.
