|   |  If you browse through CorporateInformation.com, you do so anonymously. We do not make any effort to collect your email address or any other personal information. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which parts of our website you visit and how long you spend there. The only other information we collect is the type of browser you are using, as your browser supplies us with this information automatically. 

Like many other commercial websites, CorporateInformation.com may use a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. However, you may instruct your browser not to allow any cookies to be set, and this will not impair your ability to use the site. However, if you choose to use the message boards (which are hosted at a different site and are not directly controlled by CorporateInformation.com), your username will not be automatically recognized and you will be required to manually log in before posting messages. Our advertising agencies may set cookies, but these cookies are not controlled by CorporateInformation.com and your use of the website will not be impaired if you instruct your browser to turn off cookies. 

The names and contact information of persons who request information about CorporateInformation, its products and/or its services are added to our data base so that they may be contacted in the future regarding our products, services or future opportunities. **Opting Out:** If you have provided us with such contact information, and wish not to be included in our database, please send an email to [support@corporateinformation.com](mailto:support@corporateinformation.com).

We do not sell or rent any information about our visitors, nor do we have any plans to do so in the future. 

Some of our advertisements are served through the Sonar Network, which has its own [privacy policy](http://www.sonar.com/content/privacy.htm).
