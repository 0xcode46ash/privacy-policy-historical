# Cortera Privacy Policy | Cortera

**Overview  
**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way the information obtained through this website is collected and used.

This policy applies only to information collected by Cortera from users of our website, [www.cortera.com](http://www.cortera.com/).  It does not apply to (i) information collected by Cortera in other ways, including offline; or (ii) online business profiles available through [start.cortera.com](http://start.cortera.com/).  For information on how to update an online business profile displayed through [start.cortera.com](http://start.cortera.com/), or to request that an online business profile be suppressed from being display, please visit [www.cortera.com/cortera-suppression-policy/](http://www.cortera.com/cortera-suppression-policy/).

Our website contains links to other websites operated by third parties.  Cortera is not responsible for the online information practices or policies of such third party websites, and this notice does not apply to those websites.

**Information We Collect**

A visitor to Cortera’s web site is not required to reveal any individually identifiable information. We collect some information about visitors indirectly through standard web logs, including IP address, what browser is being used (e.g., Netscape), and the domain name from which a visitor entered the site (e.g., www.yourcompany.com or www.youruniversity.edu). We normally use this information in the aggregate to administer and improve our web site. We also use technology from a third party contractor to monitor our standard web logs at the record-by-record level so we can better understand who is using our website and determine which online features they prefer.

In a few areas on our website, we also ask you to provide information that will enable us to verify whether you are entitled to access and use certain information, materials and services available from our website, or to enable us to enhance your site visit, to assist you with customer service or technical support issues, or to follow up with you after your visit, or to otherwise support your customer relationship with Cortera. It is completely optional for you to participate. However, failure to participate may mean that you cannot access and use certain information, materials and services. These include areas where users:

1.     Log on to certain areas of our website, at which point you may be prompted to provide us with your User ID code and password as a condition to gaining access to certain information, materials or services; or

2.     Register or sign up to use an Cortera service; or

3.     Subscribe to a newsletter or desire to be added to our mailing lists for other products or services; or

4.     Place an order; or

5.     Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer; or

6.     Provide feedback in an online survey.

In each of the instances above, we may ask for your name, email address, phone number, address, product preference information, User ID code and password, as well as other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers. On occasion, we may ask for additional information to enable us to provide you with access to and use of certain information, materials and services. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to “unsubscribe” to these mailings at any time.

**Cookies**

We sometimes use an Internet device called a cookie to store login or other information on your computer. A cookie is a small amount of information that a web site transfers to your computer’s hard drive. We use cookies to simplify your access and to tailor our services to your needs and interests. For some services, we offer users the choice of having a User ID code stored in a cookie so that you do not need to re-enter it when you return to the site. Most Internet browsers are set to accept cookies. Users can reset browsers to refuse cookies and still use our website, although access may be slower and less convenient.

**How We Use Personal Information Obtained Through the Website**

The personal information you provide to us when using our website, such as your name, postal or email address or telephone number will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with Cortera, and to notify you of special offers, updated information and new products and services from Cortera, offers from third parties that we think may be of interest to you, or used by Cortera or third parties for the purpose of conducting market research or surveys on behalf of Cortera. Agents or contractors of Cortera who are given access to your personal information will be required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for Cortera.

Circumstances may arise where we are required to disclose your personal information to third parties for purposes other than to support your customer relationship with Cortera, such as in connection with a corporate divestiture or dissolution where we sell all or a portion of our business or assets (including our associated customer lists containing your personal information), or if disclosure is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings.

**You Can Opt Out of Receiving Further Marketing from  Cortera at Any Time**

We will send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. Only Cortera (or agents or contractors working on behalf of Cortera and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. At any time, you can easily opt out of receiving further marketing from Cortera by emailing us at [privacy@cortera.com](mailto:privacy@cortera.com).

**Our Commitment to Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access and maintain data accuracy, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**How You Can Access or Correct Your Information**

**EU Safe Harbor**

Cortera is committed to providing protection for personal data from Europe as required by the Safe Harbor Principles.  Cortera participates in the [Safe Harbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor) framework developed jointly by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission.
