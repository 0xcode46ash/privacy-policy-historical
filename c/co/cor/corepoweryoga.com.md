**PRIVACY POLICY – corepoweryoga.com**

**PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE.**

CorePower Yoga is committed to protecting the privacy and security of the users of our website. Visitors to our website are completely anonymous. We do not collect any information from your computer unless you voluntarily submit such information to us. In the event that we request personal identification information, you provide this information solely at your discretion.

**Scope of Privacy Policy**  
This Privacy Policy applies to your use of this website. It does not apply to your use of unaffiliated sites to which this site only links. This policy covers only information collected on this site and does not cover any information collected offline by us.

**Information Collection, Use, and Sharing**  
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only collect information that you voluntarily provide to us via email or other direct contact from you. We may ask you to voluntarily provide us with personal identification information on this site, for example, by creating a username and password to access online classes, and to create an account to sign up for a recurring subscription. If you complete a contact form on yogaonline.corepoweryoga.com, we will use your information only to respond to you regarding the reason you contacted us. We will never rent, sell, intentionally disclose or distribute your personal identification information to any third party without having received your permission with the following exceptions: (1) We will release specific information about you or your account to comply with any valid legal inquiry or process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order. (2) We will also release specific information in special cases, such as if there is an attempted breach of the security of the site, or a physical or property threat to you or others. (3) We may also transfer user information, including personally identifiable information, to a successor corporate entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets or corporate division or other fundamental corporate change.

Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, programs and changes to our services or changes to this Privacy Policy.

This site uses Google Analytics (and in the future may use other similar sites or services), which is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), to better assist CorePower Yoga in understanding how this site is used. Google Analytics will place cookies on your computer that will generate information that we select about your use of the site, including your computer’s IP address. That information will be transmitted to and stored by Google. The information will be used for the purpose of evaluating consumer use of the site, compiling reports on site activity for CorePower Yoga’s use, and providing other services relating to site activity and usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. To prevent this, you may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. Please note that by doing so, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the site. The use of cookies by Google Analytics is covered by Google’s privacy policy.

This site also uses SurveyGizmo, a survey-generating technology, to gather information about your use of the site. This information is transmitted to and stored by SurveyGizmo. SurveyGizmo will place cookies on your computer that will generate information including your computer’s IP address (for geographical purposes). The information will be used for the purpose of reporting on and responding to questions, concerns, requests and feedback for internal CorePower Yoga use. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. The use of cookies by SurveyGizmo is covered by SurveyGizmo’s privacy policy.

**Your Access to and Control over Information**  
You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You may also contact us via the email address or phone number given on our website to do the following:

  * Find out what information we have retained about you in our database, if any.
  * Change/correct any data we have about you.
  * Request us to delete any data we have about you.
  * Express any concern you have about our use of your data.



You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our databases and servers although we will make reasonable efforts to do so upon your request. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You shall be responsible for all uses of your registration, whether or not authorized by you. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your registration or password.

**How We Store Your Information**  
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit personal identification information to us via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.

Whenever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser once you login, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

**Special Rules for Children**  
Because of the federal Children’s Online Privacy Act, we cannot knowingly collect any personal information from a child under the age of thirteen without the consent of that child’s parent. The statements in this Privacy Policy generally about our collection and use of personal information also apply to our treatment of personal information from children under the age of thirteen. We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen.

**Links to Other Sites**  
Users may find advertising or other content on our site that link to the sites of our advertisers, suppliers, licensors, or other third parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites. In addition, these sites or services may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies, or no policy (policies) at all. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party sites or services before providing any of them with your personal information.

This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by CorePower Yoga through this website.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites that are accessible through this site, including but not limited to, any third-party websites that process payments on behalf of CorePower Yoga.  Please be aware that third-party websites that process payments for CorePower Yoga may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. CorePower Yoga is not responsible for the privacy practices of such sites and will not be responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**  
CorePower Yoga may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Should this Privacy Policy be amended in any substantive way, changes will be posted to this web page. As we may make changes from time to time without notifying you, we suggest that you periodically consult this Privacy Policy.

**Your Acceptance of These Terms**  
By using this site, you signify your acceptance of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our site. Your continued use of the site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean that you accept these changes.
