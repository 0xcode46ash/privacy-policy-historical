# Sara Lee - Privacy Policy

**Sites Covered**   
This Privacy Policy applies to this site, [www.saralee.com](https://web.archive.org/home.aspx), and all sites of the affiliates of Sara Lee Corporation ("Sara Lee") that are linked to this site (collectively, the "Sites"). By viewing or using any Site, you are agreeing to the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. For other terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Sites, please review our Legal Statement. 

**Personal Information Collected**  
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "personal information" means any information by which you can be personally identified, and includes your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, account number and similar information. Most Sites do not require that you submit personal information to Sara Lee; however, some Sites may request personal information in order to help Sara Lee serve you more effectively. Sara Lee generally collects personal information only when you voluntarily submit such personal information to us, for example by submitting a comment or inquiry or completing a registration form. 

**Use and Retention of Personal Information  
** It is Sara Lee's policy to maintain all personal information as confidential, regardless of the purpose for which it is submitted, and to use such personal information only for the following purposes: 

  * For the specific purpose for which it was volunteered (for example to submit a comment, receive account information, purchase products, apply for employment, etc.); 
  * To track our visitors' use of the Sites for internal market research; and 
  * To notify our visitors of updates to the Sites or promotional product opportunities. 



From time to time we may use the information we collect to notify you about other services we think you will find valuable and interesting such as updates to the Site. However, if you do not want to receive this information, you can let us know when you register by using the tick box provided. 

It is Sara Lee's policy to keep personal information only for so long as needed for such purposes. Sara Lee does not sell, rent or otherwise distribute to third parties personal information about visitors to the Sites, except as needed for Sara Lee to provide the services for which such information was volunteered. However, the Sites contain links to sites controlled by, and pages maintained by, independent third parties. Sara Lee does not control use of information provided to such third parties. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you which will then be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours. 

Authorized third parties may need access to some of your personal information or that of your child under age 12 to provide the services for which you/your child provided such information. For example, if you purchase a product, we would use third party shippers to deliver the order to you and we would need to provide the shipper with your name and address. It is Sara Lee’s policy to provide to third parties only that amount of personal information that they require to complete the requested service or transaction. 

Given the global nature of both the Internet and Sara Lee, using the Internet to collect and process Personal Data usually involves the transmission of data on an international basis. By browsing the Site and communicating electronically with us, you agree that we may export Personal Data to one or more of our offices in other countries and process it there in accordance with this policy. Although data may be held in countries that do not have strict data privacy laws, we do take steps to maintain the privacy and security of your Personal Data. 

**Protection of Children’s Privacy**  
Sara Lee is very concerned about protecting children’s personal information. For this reason we limit the personal information we collect from children 12 and under to only what is necessary to respond to their online requests, such as a request for a screen saver, online newsletter, coupon or to enter a sweepstakes. Sara Lee will delete the information from our system when the requested activity is completed. At times it may be necessary to ask the child to provide an email address of a parent so we can notify the parent or seek consent. We will not condition a child's participation in any online activity on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. 

Parents are encouraged to regularly monitor and supervise their children's on-line activities. 

**Access Rights**  
You have a right to review personal information about you or your child under age 12 that is held by Sara Lee. To obtain a copy of your personal information or that of your child under age 12, or to request deletion of all personal information about you or such child in Sara Lee's possession, please submit your request in the “Contact Us“ section of saralee.com. 

**Cookies**  
A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a web server to a web browser that enables the server to collect information back from the browser. We use "cookies" to identify you when you visit the Site (our server recognizes information regarding your domain name or access provider and e-mail address) to understand how you and other visitors use the Site so that we can serve you better. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies but you can usually change your browser to prevent this. 

**Policy Revisions  
** Sara Lee reserves the right, at its discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. You should check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of this Site following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean that you accept those changes. 

_Amended August 14, 2008_
