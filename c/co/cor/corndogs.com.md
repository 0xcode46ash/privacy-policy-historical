# Hillshire Brands - Privacy Policy

#### Sites Covered 

This Privacy Policy applies to this site, www.hillshirebrands.com, and all sites of the affiliates of Hillshire Brands Company ("Hillshire Brands") that are linked to this site (collectively, the "Sites"). By viewing or using any Site, you are agreeing to the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. For other terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Sites, please review our Legal Statement. 

#### Personal Information Collected 

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "personal information" means any information by which you can be personally identified, and includes your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, account number and similar information. Most Sites do not require that you submit personal information to Hillshire Brands; however, some Sites may request personal information in order to help Hillshire Brands serve you more effectively. Hillshire Brands generally collects personal information only when you voluntarily submit such personal information to us, for example by submitting a comment or inquiry or completing a registration form. 

#### Use and Retention of Personal Information 

It is Hillshire Brands' policy to maintain all personal information as confidential, regardless of the purpose for which it is submitted, and to use such personal information only for the following purposes: 

  * For the specific purpose for which it was volunteered (for example to submit a comment, receive account information, purchase products, apply for employment, etc.); 
  * To track our visitors' use of the Sites for internal market research; and 
  * To notify our visitors of updates to the Sites or promotional product opportunities. 



From time to time we may use the information we collect to notify you about other services we think you will find valuable and interesting such as updates to the Site. However, if you do not want to receive this information, you can let us know when you register by using the tick box provided. 

It is Hillshire Brands' policy to keep personal information only for so long as needed for such purposes. Hillshire Brands does not sell, rent or otherwise distribute to third parties personal information about visitors to the Sites, except as needed for Hillshire Brands to provide the services for which such information was volunteered. However, the Sites contain links to sites controlled by, and pages maintained by, independent third parties. Hillshire Brands does not control use of information provided to such third parties. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you which will then be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours. 

Authorized third parties may need access to some of your personal information or that of your child under age 12 to provide the services for which you/your child provided such information. For example, if you purchase a product, we would use third party shippers to deliver the order to you and we would need to provide the shipper with your name and address. It is Hillshire Brandsâ€™ policy to provide to third parties only that amount of personal information that they require to complete the requested service or transaction. 

Given the global nature of both the Internet and Hillshire Brands, using the Internet to collect and process Personal Data usually involves the transmission of data on an international basis. By browsing the Site and communicating electronically with us, you agree that we may export Personal Data to one or more of our offices in other countries and process it there in accordance with this policy. Although data may be held in countries that do not have strict data privacy laws, we do take steps to maintain the privacy and security of your Personal Data.
