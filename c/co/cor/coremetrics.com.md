Privacy Policy for Our Provision of Services

The statement below regarding our provision of services is applicable only to those clients utilizing the IBM Coremetrics online analytics services.

## Our Relationships with Our Clients.

IBM Coremetrics is an agent for its clients. IBM Coremetrics receives visitor information collected from or by its clients but it does not own the information it receives. Our clients use our services to understand more about visitors to their web sites. Clients then apply this understanding to their web sites to provide web environments that save visitors time and make the sites easier to use. Each client instructs us as to what type of data it would like to collect or have IBM Coremetrics receive on its behalf. This data could include search engine referral, affiliate referrals, traffic driven by banner ads or other promotions, visitor navigation around the site, popular pages, which items are placed in shopping carts and which are abandoned, conversions and what purchases were made. We may also receive certain technical information, such as the visitor's browser version and operating system. We may, upon a client's request, collect or receive personally identifiable information such as a visitor's email address. In each client agreement, we agree that we will not make use of any data that collected by clients or received on the client's behalf except as necessary to provide our services to that client. All information about individual visitors to a web site belongs to the client, not IBM Coremetrics. IBM Coremetrics does not allow individual information collected for one client to be accessed by any other IBM Coremetrics client.

The only time that any client would see data from other client web sites is if that client is a part of IBM Coremetrics' benchmarking service. In that case the information shared is summary data only and contains no information that personally identifies any visitor. This benchmarking service provides IBM Coremetrics' clients with the ability to compare the performance of their web sites against peer groups.

We do, however, reserve a limited right to disclose any data we receive if required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority or to protect the health and safety of IBM employees, a client's employees or the general public.

**Our Clients' Use of Our Services.** We require all of our clients to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and we promise our clients that we will do the same. We also recommend that each client obtain all necessary consents from visitors to its web site during IBM Coremetrics' provision of any service, post on its web site and abide by a visitor privacy policy providing each visitor with the client's data collection and use practices; provide notice that cookies are being placed on the visitor's computer; an explanation of the purpose and utilization of such cookies; and provide on its web site an opt-out (or a link to an opt-out) so that any visitor may choose not to have his/her data collected.

**Our Clients can Combine their Existing Data with Data Collected or Received.** Our clients can send us data that they have previously collected and add that data to the data collected or received on their behalf by IBM Coremetrics. Also, a client that purchases our services may view and combine data collected on its behalf with data that has been collected by an IBM Coremetrics business partner.

**You Can Choose Not to Participate in Our Services.** IBM Coremetrics is a proponent of consumer online privacy and provides visitors to this web site with the ability to opt out of having their data collected when they visit. As noted above, IBM Coremetrics encourages all of its clients to disclose their data collection practices and to adopt the opt-out standard provided by IBM Coremetrics. When visiting one of our clients' sites, you may be able to deactivate that clients' ability to analyze your web browsing and purchasing behavior by electing to opt-out of the services as may be set forth in each individual web site. You also have the option to continue to benefit from the improved shopping experience enabled by our services, but maintain anonymity. To learn more about opting out, see below.

General Guidelines

**IBM Coremetrics and Its Clients Use Cookies to Collect Data.** IBM Coremetrics and its clients use "cookies" and "web beacons" to collect data. A cookie is a small text file containing a random and unique alphanumeric identifier that either of Coremetrics or our clients transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (unless you set your browser to reject cookies) that enables our, or our clients', systems to recognize your browser. Neither IBM Coremetrics nor its clients store any personally identifiable information in cookies. A web beacon (also known as a "clear GIF", "pixel tag", "data tag" or "image tag") is a mechanism by which a small section of code that our clients place on their web site pages executes an image request to our data collection servers. Web beacons facilitate the transfer of data by requesting and delivering the transparent graphic GIF image from IBM Coremetrics to our client's web site pages.

**How We Secure the Data Collected or Received.** IBM Coremetrics has taken proactive measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of data that its clients collect or IBM Coremetrics or receives on its clients' behalf. Every step has been taken with the view to ensuring maximum security for data transfer and storage. Our infrastructure employs leading technology solutions for end-to-end security, which protects data at each point of transfer; from receipt to storage to reporting. We use multiple back-up systems to reduce the chance of data loss, and for up-to-date and accurate information. We also employ internal policies and procedures limiting our employees' and vendors' access to client data and other client confidential information, so that access is permitted only to fulfill our contractual agreements with our clients and consistent with this Privacy Statement.

**If You Contact Us.** We answer the email we receive by sending an email response to the sender. We also store the email we receive for archival purposes and for our own marketing purposes if we feel that it is consistent with the nature of the inquiry. We will not use return email addresses for any other purpose unless you give us permission to do so.

Visitor Opt-Out

IBM Coremetrics offers you the ability to opt-out of:

  1. _The IBM Coremetrics Marketing/Ad Impression Cookie_ – used to collect information about my viewed marketing and advertising impressions on behalf of the IBM Coremetrics' web site or any IBM Coremetrics client web site for which IBM Coremetrics collects data using its own cookie, and
  2. _The IBM Coremetrics Site Analytics Cookie_ – used to collect information about my experience at IBM Coremetrics' web site or on any IBM Coremetrics client web site for which IBM Coremetrics collects data using its own cookie.



Please be aware that IBM Coremetrics' data collection methods allow for our clients to control the implementation of the IBM Coremetrics Site Analytics Cookie opt-out function on their sites and the process for opting-out originates on each of their web sites. As a result, opting out of one client's collection of data will not opt you out of any other client's collection of data and if you have previously opted out you should do so again on each client site for which you do not wish to have data collected about your activities. As with any web site you visit, you should refer to that web site's privacy policy for information on managing personal information.

**Opt-Out Options.** IBM Coremetrics offers two (2) methods by which visitors can opt-out of data collection associated with their online activities is - 1) "Anonymous Visitor" and 2) "Total Opt-Out" (which are both discussed below). For either of these options to take effect, you must first accept a cookie from this site which will allow us to recognize you with a random and unique alphanumeric identifier so that we can honor your opt-out selection. If you do not accept this cookie, or later delete it, we cannot honor your request to opt-out and you will continue to be served cookies.

**Opt-Out Instructions.**

If you choose to opt-out:

  1. Verify your browser acceptance settings. 
    * If you have your browser set to automatically accept cookies, proceed to the step 2.
    * If you set your browser to prompt you for permission to receive a cookie, and have not already accepted a IBM Coremetrics cookie, please click "Refresh" and accept the cookie from this page when prompted.
    * If you set your browser or cookie-blocking software so as to block cookies, please change these settings then click "Refresh" and accept the cookie from this page when prompted.
  2. Select one of the opt-out choices available to you and click Submit.
  3. Once you click "Submit" below, your submission will take effect immediately.
  4. For the Off-Site/Ad Impression cookie, you only need to make this selection on this site.
  5. For the Site Analytics cookie, you need to make this selection on each client web site from which you wish to opt out. You will need to follow the applicable instructions as explained on the client web site. For those sites employing IBM Coremetrics opt-out technology, you will need to complete a similar process as detailed here for our web site.



## What Happens After You Select Your Opt-Out Option?

Your IBM Coremetrics cookie contains a random and unique alphanumeric identifier. If you select the "Anonymous Visitor" option, at either of this web site or a client web site, then for such web site your cookie will be modified to read "anonymous", meaning that IBM Coremetrics will continue to collect or receive data about your experience at the site you visit. However, such data will be presented as part of a pool of general, anonymous visitors. If you select "Total Opt-Out" at either of this web site or a client web site then for such web site your cookie will be modified to read "opt-out", meaning that no data will be collected about you at that site. IBM Coremetrics will in such cases record that a "Total Opt-Out" election has been made, so that aggregated totals of "Total Opt-Out" elections can be calculated and recorded. Once you make your selection, a dialog box should appear to confirm that your opt-out choice was successful. The opt-out will remain in effect for as long as the cookie remains on your hard drive. If you remove this cookie from your hard drive (for instance, if you reinstall or update your browser or choose to delete all cookies), you will need to renew your opt-out selection.

Remember, if you choose to opt out of the Site Analytics cookie you will need to do so the first time you visit any of our clients' sites which provide opt-out to avoid having your information collected by that site. Further, if you use more than one web browser or computer, you will need to opt-out in each one. Please note that if you upgrade your browser to a new version (including, but not limited to, Microsoft's Internet Explorer 8.0), you may need to opt out again. For your convenience, you can check your current opt-out status for this site at any time as described below.
