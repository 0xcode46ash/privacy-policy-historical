# Corporate Perks by NextJump.com

Your Privacy  
We are committed to protecting your privacy. At no time will we trade, sell, or distribute for free company specific or personal information, including email addresses or other user IDs, to any individual, company, vendor or organization.

The Personal Information We Collect  
Your first name, last name and a valid work email address represent the only pieces of personal information you must submit to access "Perks."  
Additionally, Perks collects click-stream data and other preference information on its users in order to improve the design and vendor selection of the site. Click-stream data represents a page-by-page history of a person's site usage.  
Perks is a portal through which users access discounts redeemable at selected vendors. In most cases, online purchases facilitated by the Perks portal are subject to the privacy policies of the Web Site where that transaction is conducted. In a few cases, however, Next Jump Inc. itself functions as the vendor and must collect additional personal information, described later in this privacy policy, to complete the online transaction.

How We Use This Personal Information  
We require your first name, last name and email address for the following reasons:  
· To provide a point of contact for communicating Perks correspondence, including your personal password, technical issues that may arise and periodic reminders that you may request (on an opt-in basis) as a Perks user.  
· To assign a name to your user id and password.  
· To verify your employment with the organization using Next Jump Inc. "Perks."  
Click-stream data can help determine the popularity of vendors, offers and site features with our audience, allowing us to develop a better site. An individual user's click-stream data is kept in the strictest confidence, and will never be distributed to any party outside of Next Jump Inc.

What Information We Share  
Next Jump Inc. only shares aggregated data to third party vendors, but it will not disclose information specific to any user or company. This information represents a generic overview of our users' collective viewing habits and allows vendors to modify their discounts based on user traffic.  
Additionally, some participating corporations have requested monthly reports of employee traffic on their Perks site. These reports will reveal only the aggregated viewing habits of Perks visitors from that corporation. The reports will not disclose the user name, login ID or any other personal information of users.

Emails  
Next Jump Inc. will not send unsolicited emails to registered users at a corporation without that corporation's consent.  
Additionally, users may choose to receive Perks correspondence, including email reminders of specific vendor offers and Perks newsletters. The "my account" channel on the site displays the correspondence you've elected to receive, and provides the option to unsubscribe from future Perks related emails.

Opting Out  
All emails sent by Perks contain directions on how to unsubscribe from future correspondence. At any time, users may opt out of Perks related correspondence by sending an email to Corporate Perks@nextjump.com, or by following the directions posted in the "My Account" channel on the Web Site.  
In addition, a registered user who wishes his personal information to be completely removed from the Perks database should email CorporatePerks@nextjump.com. An employee's complete removal of his or her personal information from the database negates that employee's ability to login to "Perks."

Notification Of Changes To Privacy Policy  
Users will be notified of changes or revisions to this privacy policy by a notice posted on their company's Perks login page. The notice will contain a link, whereby the Privacy policy can be examined in full. In this way registered users are made aware of policy changes prior to shopping or browsing the Web Site.  
As always, a user who is not amenable to the conditions of a revised privacy policy may opt out of Perks by means outlined earlier in this document.

Purchasing Items Directly Through the Perks Site  
Perks is a portal that provides access to exclusive discounts redeemable at the point of purchase at a certain vendor's online or offline location. In rare cases, Perks may serve as both vendor and portal, and will collect certain information necessary to complete an online purchase. Like every online purchase, you will be required to submit the following information to buy an item where Perks is the vendor:  
· Shipping or billing address or both  
· Credit card information  
· Day time phone number  
· Email address  
In all cases, any transaction conducted through the Perks site is secured and encrypted with SSL technology, and certified by Verisign. Hence, you may submit any sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) to this site with the assurance that it will remain protected.  
Again, Perks will never compromise your personal privacy. Information submitted to carry out a transaction where Next Jump Inc. is the vendor is kept in the highest confidentiality, and is absolutely never shared with outside parties.

Vendor's Privacy  
Perks is a portal that enables users to purchase discounted products on the Web Sites of participating vendors. Each vendor maintains its' own privacy policy that you should be familiar with before you submit your personal information. Our privacy policy is not applicable on any of the vendor sites. Therefore, it is important for a potential buyer to familiarize himself with the privacy policies of each vendor.  
We will never transmit personal identifiers, including name, email address, or user ids to any participating vendor. Clicking on a vendor site through Perks does not result in the transmission of your personal information to that vendor.

Limits  
Although your privacy is of paramount concern to us, we cannot reasonably be expected to suppress information where the withholding of such information represents a violation of federal or state law.

Your Consent  
As a user of the Perks program, you consent to our collection and storage of your personal information (as defined above) in our database, and to our use of aggregated and non-personal information generated by the viewing habits of our users.

In Summary  
We are committed to protecting your privacy. We do not sell, trade, give away, or rent personal or company information to any outside parties. We use the information we collect on the site to make shopping and promotional activities possible and to enhance your overall experience with the Corporate Perks Program.
