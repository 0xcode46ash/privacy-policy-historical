# Privacy policy - CORE

Personal data

You don’t have to create an account or provide us with any personal information to access the CORE website or ebooks. However, we will ask for some personal details if you wish to access additional resources. This information will be obtained via our websites’ registration form only. 

The personal data we store and process will include:  
• your name,  
• your email address,  
• your student or teacher status,  
• name of your institution or university, city and country.

When you provide us with your contact details you will be asked whether you wish to receive any further communications from us. 

We will ensure that all personal data you supply is held in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. We do not sell or otherwise transfer personal data to any third parties or use it for any other purpose.

Visits to CORE website

When you visit the CORE website we may collect non-personally-identifiable information relating to your use of our site via Google Analytics technology. This may include: which pages you see, how long you stay, what you click on our pages, if you visit the website again, which country and city you are browsing from, etc. This information is collected anonymously and we use it in aggregated form strictly to analyse how the CORE website is used by visitors. Further information and instructions for opting out of Google Analytics tracking are available at: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.

Communication from CORE

If you agreed to receive further communications from CORE from time to time we might send you useful information about the services we offer, new materials we published on the CORE website, or to request feedback on our material and information about the course you are teaching.

In order to do this we have a database that contains personal data collected at the time of registration. You have a right to request copies of the data held about you by CORE. To do so, please contact us at conctact@core-econ.org. If you no longer want us to use your data, or wish to amend the type of communications you receive, then you can opt out at any time via the unsubscribe link included in every email.
