# Corel Legal

At Corel, we recognize that our customers are concerned about the privacy of the information that we collect from our customers and our plans for using this information. Our goal is to ensure that we only gather information about you that you want us to have and that we only use this information after we have told you how it will be used and have given you the opportunity to consent to its use. 

The following links provide details about why Corel collects customer information, what we do with Customer information, and how you can control access to and distribution of the information that you provide to Corel.

**Why We Collect Customer Information**

One of the ways Corel ensures that it is developing products that meet the needs of our customers is to gather information directly from them. We like to know who are customers are, what types of products they use and what their product expectations are. Through market research projects, customer feedback and registration we are able to explore what is or is not attractive about our products. 

Sometimes we are required by law to request certain information; for example, when you enter a contest, purchase products from Corel eStore™ or download files, patches or fixes from our Web or FTP sites. 

As well, we require user information to keep our records up to date and to be able to properly identify you, such as when you register a product online or request technical support. 

It is always our objective to collect only that information necessary for us to achieve the purposes for which we are collecting information. For example, we will not ask you for credit card information unless you are purchasing a product or service from us. Whenever we ask for information, we will also inform you as to what use we will make of it before or at the time we collect the information and you will be offered the choice as to whether or not you wish to provide information to us. For example, if we are using the information solely for marketing and research purposes we will advise you of that. 

Please note that in some instances such as product registration and purchases, there is some information that we are required to collect to enable us to accurately register or support your product and we may not be able to allow you to register or purchase products without that information. Corel may also be required by law to disclose certain information (for example, the geographical location of customers who download products containing high-level encryption). 

**Corel Customer Lists and Third-Party Co-Marketing Activities**

From time to time we undertake co-marketing arrangements with third parties who offer similar products or services. As a registered Corel customer, you may receive news and special offers from these third parties. In those instances where your name and contact information will be placed on a list that may be made available to a third party, we will advise you of that and offer you the opportunity to have your name marked “private” in our database. If your name is marked “private”, we will not use your name for marketing or e-mail campaigns and will not provide your name to any third parties. 

**Marking Your Name “Private” After You Register With Us**

If you choose to register with us and then later decide that you no longer want to receive e-mail or information from Corel or you no longer wish to have your name provided to third parties, you may contact us at:

**Deleting Your Name From Our Customer List Entirely**

If you decide that you no longer wish to have your name on our Customer list at all, please contact us at the address above. Deletion of your information will usually take four to six weeks. 

Please note that if you are a registered Corel product user and you delete your name from our customer list, you will no longer receive e-mail or other notices regarding technical support of your product, such as notices of available patches and fixes. 

**Updating or Correcting Your Information**

If your information changes or you become aware that there is an error in your information, please contact us at the address above. Correction or updates of your information will usually take four to six weeks. 

**If You Receive Unwanted Materials**

From time to time there may be instances where a customer's designation as “private” is inadvertently removed and the customer may receive e-mail or other marketing materials from Corel. If you think this may have happened to you, please let us know by contacting Customer Service at the address above and we will correct the problem. Please keep in mind that if you have submitted a request to have your name marked private or removed from our Customer List or you have requested that your information be updated or corrected, there is a four to six week period during which you may receive information from us while we are updating or deleting your information. 

**Security of Your Information When Purchasing Products from Corel eStore™**

Corel offers both electronic and shrinkwrap products online from Corel eStore. 

Corel eStore uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Protocol for browsers that support 128-bit encryption (such as Netscape® Navigator version 2.0 or greater, or Microsoft® Internet Explorer version 2.1 or greater). SSL encrypts information as it travels between the customer and Corel so that your purchase information cannot be read as it travels over the Internet. 

If you are not using a browser which adheres to SSL Protocol and does not support 128 bit encryption, the information you provide may not be secure and we recommend that you contact Corel directly by phone to order products. 

A change in the URL from http:// to https:// notifies you that you are using SSL. If the URL on a page asking you to provide personal information remains as http://, beware: this may result in an insecure transmission. 

When processing credit card purchases over the Internet, our third party service provider, Digital River, Inc., will verify your credit card information with the appropriate financial institution prior to processing your purchase. Digital River will not supply this information to Corel or to any other third party.
