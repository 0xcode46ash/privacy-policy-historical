## Data Privacy

In order to process your booking and ensure that your travel arrangements run smoothly and meet your requirements we need to use the information you provide such as name, address, any special needs/dietary requirements etc.

We take full responsibility for ensuring proper measures are in place to protect your information and we comply with all applicable data protection legislation as detailed by the UK Data Protection Act 1998. Information about you may be passed to other companies within Co-op Group Travel 1 Limited for administration, marketing and analysis purposes and for customer surveys and market research.

We collect information such as name, address and date of birth when an enquiry is generated, or a booking is made. We may contact you by mail, telephone, fax or email to let you know about any other products, services or promotions that may be of interest to you.

We must pass the information on to the relevant suppliers of your travel arrangements such as airlines, hotels, transport companies etc. The tour operator or relevant supplier’s use of your information is subject to their policy, both in respect of your booking and any future marketing.
