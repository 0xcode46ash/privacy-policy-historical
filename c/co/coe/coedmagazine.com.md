Coedmagazine.com sends out email newsletters, invitations and messages of various kinds to users, who reserve the right to block reception of such notices by sending an email to editor@Coedmagazine.com.

Third-party advertisers may come from users of Coedmagazine.com or an advertising partner, who can set cookies, allowing the ad server to recognize your computer each time you are sent an advertisement. Ad servers gather information about how you saw their advertisements and which ones you responded to. Advertisers then send the advertising message of most interest to you. Coedmagazine.com will occasionally share users’ information, but not by name or any other identifying criteria, so that third-party users can learn, for example, what soft drinks are most popular at a particular school.

Coedmagazine.com users may edit their personal content at any time. They can also limit the amount of their content available to other users. However, if it has been captured by other users, it is impossible to receive that provided information.
