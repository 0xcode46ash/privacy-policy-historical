### Information Collection and Use

**Information Collection**

COhomefinder is the sole owner of the information collected on the site www.COhomefinder.com. COhomefinder collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

**Registration**

In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as first name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he has expressed interest, such as sending new listings as part of the Automated HomeAlert system. It is optional for the user to provide real estate related information (such as relocation plans and search criteria), and unique identifiers (such as, username and password), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site and the most effective real estate services.

### Information Use

**Profile**

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Web site and to direct pertinent real estate information to them. **We do not share personal profiles with any other third parties. Personal profiles can only be only be accessed by designated COhomefinder employees and REALTORS.**

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

By setting a cookie on our site, users do not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. See the "Profile" section.

### No Third Party Advertising

**No third party advertisers are allowed on the Web site www.COhomefinder.com, nor does COhomefinder share any personal profile information of its users with any third party advertiser.**

**Log Files**

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable and enhance our Web-based service. We use a custom tracking utility that uses log files to analyze use of the site and serve our clients. 

### Communications from the Site

**Market Updates and New Listings**

The Automated HomeAlert system emails users when new listings that match a user's search criteria are posted on the Multiple Listing Service in their search area.

**Services and Market Updates**

We send all new members a welcoming email to explain the services provided by COhomefinder. Established members will occasionally receive information about our services, market updates, home buying or selling tips, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

**Newsletter**

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

**COhomefinder Client Care**

Our Client Care team communicates with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.

**COhomefinder REALTORS**

We partner with REALTORS that serve specific geographic markets to provide real estate services to COhomefinder users that expressly request the services of a REALTOR. When the user requests these particular services, the appropriate COhomefinder REALTOR receives the user's name, contact information, and home search criteria in order to provide real estate services to the user. 

**Service Announcements**

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. 

**Business Transitions**

In the event COhomefinder goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. 

**Choice/Opt-out**

Users who no longer wish to receive Automated HomeAlert emails, our newsletter and/or general communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by [**clicking here to contact us.**](https://web.archive.org/contact-Boulder-Colorado-homefinder.htm) The user may also contact us by phone at (303) 543-3083 or mail at 4041 Hanover, Suite 200, Boulder, CO 80305 to opt-out. 

**Links**

We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**Surveys & Contests **

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Anonymous survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

**Tell-A-Friend**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. COhomefinder will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. COhomefinder stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may contact COhomefinder to request the removal of this information from our database.

**Security**

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

The information that a user provides when registering on m.cOhomefinder.com is stored in our secure database that is only accessible by designated Colorado HomeFinder employees. 

Not only do we protect user-information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our customer service representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment in a locked facility.

This can be done at the "Update Profile" page, or by contacting Client Care at (303) 543-3083. 

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.   
If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email.
