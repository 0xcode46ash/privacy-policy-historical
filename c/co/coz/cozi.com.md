Commitment To Your Privacy

This site is owned and operated by Cozi Group, Inc. We understand you value your privacy. At Cozi, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. This statement governs information you provide to us or we learn from your use of this Web site and tells you how we may collect, use, and in some instances share this information. Our policies may differ from other service offerings and you should carefully review the terms of service and this privacy notice before using these services. 

Information Cozi Collects And How We Use It

  * Voluntary Information. Cozi collects personal information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions, such as e-mail and online registration forms or through participation in online polls, discussion forums, or other community features. Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, your name, e-mail address, or billing information. The types and amount of personal information collected for these activities will vary depending on the activity. We use this information to provide and improve our services, to tailor your user experience, and to prevent fraud. If you register to join a mailing list we may send e-mail notices to you about new products, special advertisements, offers, and other notices. You may choose to opt-out of receiving these e-mails. 
  * Server Logs. Cozi also collects information from our server logs. These server logs may include information such as your Internet Protocol address, browser details, and the date and time of your request. We use this information to improve our content and services. 
  * Cookies. We may place a text file called a "cookie" on your computer. This cookie does not contain personal information, although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. (A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.) Cozi may use cookies to track user traffic patterns. In addition, Cozi may use encrypted cookies to authenticate the user on each page after the user logs on to the service. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you’ve set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. 
  * Links. Cozi may track whether links to external Web sites are followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our service, customized content, and advertising. 



Children

Consistent with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without parental consent. We provide parents with information so they can decide whether to provide their personal information or permit their children to use our services. If we receive parental consent, we may receive personal information from children under the age of 13 in order to provide our services to them. 

Cozi Transfer And Information Sharing Policy

We do not share personal information collected on this Web site with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We may provide personal information to trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. Cozi may share aggregate information about our customers with third parties. This aggregate information will not be tied to a user’s personal information. Cozi does not share personal information about site users with third parties unless doing so is appropriate to carry out a user’s request or it reasonably believes that doing so is legally required or is in Cozi’s interest to protect its property or other legal rights or the rights or property of others. 

  * Merger or Bankruptcy. If Cozi should ever file for bankruptcy or have its assets sold to or merge with another entity, information Cozi receives from you from this site is a Cozi asset and may be transferred. 



International Visitors And Customers

This Web site is hosted in the United States. If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States, which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and by providing your personal data you consent to:

  * The use of your personal data for the uses identified above in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and 
  * The transfer of your personal data to the United States as indicated above.



Security

No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. We use several means to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of our safeguards.

If Cozi learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this Web site or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of this site. Cozi may post a notice on our Web site if a security breach occurs. Cozi may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at [privacy@cozi.com](mailto:privacy@cozi.com).

Changes and Updates

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date on the Privacy Policy. For changes to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing the change. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect.
