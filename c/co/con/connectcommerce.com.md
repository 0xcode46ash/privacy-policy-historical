**Privacy Statement**

This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for Dynamic Trade, Inc., and its Web sites <http://www.dynamictrade.com/> and <http://www.connectcommerce.com/>. If you feel that Dynamic Trade is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should contact Dynamic Trade by e-mail at [privacy@dynamictrade.com.](mailto:privacy@dynamictrade.com)

**Information Collection and Use**

Dynamic Trade will not sell, share, or rent information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Dynamic Trade collects different types of information from three different types of parties: its marketers, its partners and end-customers of its marketers when those customers are referred to the marketers by way of the partners.

Partners must register on Dynamic Trade's ConnectCommerce Web site [(http://www.connectcommerce.com/)](http://www.connectcommerce.com/). Marketers are registered by Dynamic Trade upon closing of a relationship agreement with the marketer. End customers are never registered on the Dynamic Trade's Web site.

> **Registration**  
>  To participate in the ConnectCommerce network, a partner must first complete the registration form. During registration the partner is required to give their contact information (such as name and e-mail address). This information is used to contact the partner about relationships with marketers in which they have expressed interest. End customers do not register on any of Dynamic Trade's Web sites.
> 
> **Order**  
>  We do not collect personally identifiable information when an end-customer places an order with one of our marketers. When an order takes place as a result of a referral from our partners, we collect generic order data such as total order amount so that we can ensure that our partners are compensated for their referrals.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. We use cookies to keep track of which customers have been referred to our marketers by our partners. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information when making purchases through our network. 

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track end-customers' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**  
We will share aggregated demographic information with our marketers and partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. Also, we will not share transaction data about any specific marketer with any other marketer, and we will not share transaction data about any specific partner with any other partner. We will share marketer data with partners and vice versa, but only when the specific marketer and the specific partner were both parties to the transaction. In other words, a marketer can see all of his/her transactions across all of his/her partners, and a partner can see all of his/her transactions across all of his/her marketers. No marketer has access to any other marketer's or partner's data, and no partner has access to any other partner's or marketer's data. 

From time to time, partners who register on the ConnectCommerce Web site may be contacted by Dynamic Trade regarding participation in other marketer's I -Performance Marketing programs. Partners may opt out of this contact. Similarly, Dynamic Trade will share marketer information with an appropriate set of partners, as determined by Dynamic Trade and the marketer. Marketers may opt out of this information sharing.

**Online Partnerships**  
All parties (end customers, marketers and partners) should be aware that Dynamic Trade is essentially a manager of online relationships between other Web sites. Dynamic Trade's privacy policy applies to Dynamic Trade's own Web sites and servers, and not those of its marketers and partners. Any party with concerns about privacy should investigate the privacy policies of the marketer and partner who are party to a given transaction. Dynamic Trade has no control over these policies. 

**Security**  
Dynamic Trade takes every precaution to protect our users' information. Sensitive information gathered via our servers is protected both online and off-line. 

All transaction information and sensitive data is transmitted encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), an industry leading standard for transmitting data across networks. We use SSL to secure the transmission of sensitive data between our network and our marketers' and partners' networks. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All transaction information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, received from marketers and partners that is stored on our network is encrypted. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure hosting environment. ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure that our marketers' and partners' information is protected. 

If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can send an email to [privacy@dynamictrade.com.](mailto:privacy@dynamictrade.com)
