Last Updated December 20, 2013

ContactUs.com is a suite of online contact management solutions for small business websites (“ContactUs.com” or “Services”). Your privacy and protection of information you share with us while using our Services is very important to us.

This “Privacy Policy” explains what information we gather from our users and how we use it. By using or accessing our Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. (Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meaning set forth in our [Terms of Service](http://www.contactus.com/terms-of-service.php)). ContactUs.com is not intended for children under 13 years of age. Consistent with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), we will never knowingly gather or use personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13, and we do not allow anyone under the age of 13 to register on ContactUs.com.

### YOUR DATA

We respect the privacy of our account holders and the privacy of their client data. All user information contained within the forms you may use or build on ContactUs.com are governed by our Terms of Service. Although ContactUs.com owns the data storage, databases and the ContactUs.com Site, you retain all rights to your data.

### WHAT INFORMATION DOES CONTACTUS.COM GATHER?

ContactUs.com gathers and stores three types of information about users that are subject to our Privacy Policy:

Personal Information:  
Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”). These are voluntary submissions made when creating an account on ContactUs.com or through your use of the Services, such as name and email address provided during registration and form submissions, or payment information provided during purchases. When you sign into ContactUs.com or post or upload any content that you knowingly choose to disclose and/or post on the ContactUs.com.com website, your information is not anonymous to us.

Navigational Information:   
“Navigational Information”. We keep track of user interactions with our Services, such as visiting a web page, clicking a button, and choosing a form. Also, when users access our Services, we collect information about their access method (such as hardware and software attributes), location, IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and pages viewed. In addition, we store certain information from their browser using “cookies”. (For more on cookies, please see the section “What are cookies?”)

Navigational Information may collected by us and our partners, and is used for the purpose of improving the quality and relevancy of the advertisements served by us and our partners (referred to as “Retargeting”), diagnosing problems with the server and to administer the Services. In the absence of the voluntary submission of Personally Identifiable Information, such Navigational Information is completely anonymous, and only includes information such as the date and time of visit, domain type, and their activity on our Advertiser’s or Partner’s websites. None of this information, individually or grouped together, can be traced back to a specific individual.

When you voluntarily submit Personally Identifiable Information, the data referred to as Navigational Information for a particular user, including cookies, may become personally identifiable to us and our Customers.

_Navigational Information Collected by Our Customers_  
Our customers can use the tools we provide, as well as tools provided by third parties, to collect Navigational Information when you visit their webpages on the Paid Service. ContactUs.com does not control our customers’ use of these tools, nor do we control the information they collect or how they use it.

Information from Third Parties:   
We do not own or operate any third-party services offered that you may use or interact with through our Services (collectively, “Third Party Services”). Whenever you visit, use or interact with a Third Party Service, we may receive information from them, including information about actions you take and Content you post on that service.

_Facebook_  
ContactUs.com allows you to sign up and log in using your Facebook account. If you sign up using Facebook, Facebook will ask your permission to share certain information from your Facebook account with ContactUs.com. This includes your first name, last name and email address. This information is collected by Facebook and is provided to us under the terms of [Facebook’s privacy policy](http://www.facebook.com/policy.php). You can control the information that we receive from Facebook using the privacy settings in your Facebook account. If you signed up using Facebook by mistake, you can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings at any time.

E-mail Communications:  
We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from ContactUs.com if your computer supports this type of program, in order to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We may also send out emails with information regarding ContactUs.com or our partners including promotions and events. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us by sending an email to support@contactus.com.

Payment Information:  
We collect and process this using third party PCI-compliant service providers payment information from you when you subscribe to the Paid Service, including credit cards numbers and billing information. Except for this, we do not collect sensitive information from you.

### WHY DOES CONTACTUS.COM GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT ME?

ContactUs.com collects information in order to improve the content and quality of our Services and to provide a customized experience tailored to your needs. Any personally identifiable information we collect (including email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, IP address) is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under special circumstances outlined in this Privacy Policy.

### WHAT ARE COOKIES?

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. ContactUs.com employs cookies in order for its server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user. The cookies placed by the ContactUs.com server are readable only by ContactUs.com, and cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on a computer.

ContactUs.com places a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer. These cookies help us make ContactUs.com easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and ContactUs.com. For example, a cookie may be used to store or “remember” your user login information (but not your password) so that you are not required to manually log into the site at every visit. This data is also used to deliver customized content and promotions within ContactUs.com to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use some of our Services.

Our advertisers and partners may also set cookies through our Services. For more information, please see the section “What about third party advertisers and links?”

### WHAT ABOUT THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS AND LINKS?

In the course of serving advertisements on ContactUs.com, a third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Additionally, some links from ContactUs.com may lead to websites operated by other companies. While these websites and advertisements may be co-branded with our name or logo, they are not operated or maintained by us. We do not control these cookies and users of ContactUs.com Services should check the privacy policy of the relevant advertiser to understand whether and how it uses cookies. ContactUs.com is not responsible for websites operated by third parties that are linked to by any of our sites.

### HOW SECURE IS MY INFORMATION?

ContactUs.com uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural measures to safeguard any information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. We limit access to personal information about you to employees whom we believe reasonably need that information to provide support, products, or services to you or to fulfill their roles within our organization.

Although we have established and maintain security procedures to protect your personally identifiable information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. You can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your information by using common sense security practices such as choosing a h3 password, using different passwords for different services, and using up-to-date antivirus software.

Please report any security violations to us on this automated form.

### WHAT CONTROL DO I HAVE OVER MY INFORMATION?

As a registered Member, you may modify or update your personal account information at any time by logging into your account. Should you desire to do so, you may also delete and close your ContactUs.com account at any time by contacting our support team. Note that removed or deleted information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time.

### HOW IS INFORMATION SHARED?

ContactUs.com will not share your personally identifiable information with others except as described herein and in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is reasonably necessary to offer the Services, legally required, or permitted by you. For example, we may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the Services at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about the Services, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time.

Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the ContactUs.com-specified purposes. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of ContactUs.com (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by ContactUs.com, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the ContactUs.com [Terms of Service](http://www.contactus.com/terms-of-service.php) or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety or rights of members of the public or users of the Services. ContactUs.com reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of ContactUs.com or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.
