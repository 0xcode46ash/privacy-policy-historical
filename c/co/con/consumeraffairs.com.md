We collect only the domain name, but not the e-mail address of visitors to our Web page, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

The information we collect is used, in some instances, for internal review, analyzed to improve the content of our Web page and used to notify consumers about updates to our Web site. 

Consumer complaints filed by visitors to our site are retained indefinitely in a database intended to assist us in analyzing the performance of commercial vendors. Consumer complaints are sometimes shared with expert consultants, regulatory and law enforcement authorities and responsible members of the news media. Also, the information the consumer reports to us may be reviewed by attorneys at no cost to the consumer and can be used in the course of prosecuting claims and therefore may become a part of an official court record and/or proceeding. 

Consumer complaints may also be forwarded to the companies about which the consumer is complaining. To receive such information, companies must agree that they will use the information only in an attempt to resolve the complaint and/or improve their practices, not for marketing purposes. They must also agree not to use the information for litigation purposes. 

Consumers should be aware that information provided to us may be subpoenaed by courts of law and that in most instances we will be obligated to honor lawful court orders. 

We do not make the e-mail addresses of those who access our site available to commercial organizations for marketing purposes except in the case of companies wishing to resolve consumer complaints. 

If you supply us with your postal address on-line you will only receive the information for which you provided us your address.

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers on-line will only receive telephone contact from us or third parties with information regarding their consumer complaint or inquiry. The information is not used for marketing purposes.

**Advertising** We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

**Third Party Cookies** In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.

From time to time, we may use consumer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.
