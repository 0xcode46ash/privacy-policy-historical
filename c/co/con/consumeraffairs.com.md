We collect only the domain name, but not the e-mail address of visitors to our Web page, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

 **How we use the information we receive about you:**

The information we collect is used, in some instances, for internal review, analyzed to improve the content of our Web page and used to notify consumers about updates to our Web site.

Consumer complaints filed by visitors to our site are retained indefinitely in a database intended to assist us in analyzing the performance of commercial vendors. Consumer complaints are sometimes shared with expert consultants, regulatory and law enforcement authorities and responsible members of the news media. Also, the information the consumer reports to us may be reviewed by attorneys at no cost to the consumer and can be used in the course of prosecuting claims and therefore may become a part of an official court record and/or proceeding.

Consumer complaints may be forwarded to the companies about which the consumer is complaining. To receive such information, companies must agree that they will use the information only in an attempt to resolve the complaint and/or improve their practices, not for marketing purposes. They must also agree not to use the information for litigation purposes.

Consumer complaints may also be posted on other websites with which we are affiliated or have a business relationship. 

Information provided to us may be subpoenaed by courts of law and in most instances we will be obligated to honor lawful court orders. We may also disclose information we collect to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues, or to protect our rights and property.

By providing us with information, you understand and waive any right to anonymity that you might otherwise have and consent to our disclosure of your information as set forth in this privacy policy.

We do not make the e-mail addresses of those who access our site available to commercial organizations for marketing purposes except in the case of companies wishing to resolve consumer complaints.

If you supply us with your postal address on-line you will only receive the information for which you provided us your address.

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers on-line will only receive telephone contact from us or third parties with information regarding their consumer complaint or inquiry. The information is not used for marketing purposes.
