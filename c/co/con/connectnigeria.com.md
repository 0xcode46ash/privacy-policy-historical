# Privacy Policy | Connect Nigeria

**About this Privacy Policy**  
Privacy is an important priority for Connect Nigeria. Practical tips have been developed to help guard against Internet fraud, secure your computer and protect your personal information.

**How Connect Nigeria Uses Your Personal Information**  
This policy covers how Connect Nigeria treats personal information that we collect and receive. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This privacy policy applies only to Connect Nigeria and does not apply to the practices of companies that Connect Nigeria does not own or control, or to people that Connect Nigeria does not employ or manage.

Connect Nigeria collects personal information when you register, when you visit Connect Nigeria web pages and when you enter promotions. Connect Nigeria may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.

When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, postal code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. When you register with Connect Nigeria and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.

Connect Nigeria automatically receives and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, Connect Nigeria cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the pages you request.

Connect Nigeria uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
Connect Nigeria does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Connect Nigeria under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help us communicate with you about offers from Connect Nigeria and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.

We respond to court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Connect Nigeria’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

We transfer information about you if Connect Nigeria is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Connect Nigeria will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Connect Nigeria displays targeted advertising based on personal information. Connect Nigeria does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.

Connect Nigeria advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).

Connect Nigeria works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business.

**Cookies**  
Connect Nigeria may set and access cookies on your computer. Connect Nigeria lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Connect Nigeria’s cookies. Connect Nigeria uses web beacons to access Connect Nigeria cookies inside and outside our network of web sites and in connection with Connect Nigeria products and services. You can delete Connect Nigeria cookies on your computer at any time – just remember that deleting these cookies will also result in the loss of your Connect Nigeria preferences and saved passwords and settings.

**Editing your Account Information**  
You can edit your Connect Nigeria Account Information at any time.

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Connect Nigeria service, such as announcements, administrative messages and the Connect Nigeria Newsletter, that are considered part of your Connect Nigeria account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.

You can delete your Connect Nigeria account by visiting your Account page. Please click here to read about information that might possibly remain in our archived records after your account has been deleted. 

**Confidentiality and Security**  
We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. 

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with government and industry regulations to protect personal information about you.

Connect Nigeria may update this policy at any time. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Connect Nigeria account.
