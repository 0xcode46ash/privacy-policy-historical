# Privacy Policy | Control4

### YOUR PRIVACY MATTERS

Control4 respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the personal information that you decide to share with us. The purpose of this policy is to explain the types of information Control4 collects, how we collect it, what we use it for, and how you can restrict the use or disclosure of personally identifiable information. This privacy policy covers all information collected by Control4, including without limitation (1) information obtained from your visit to our websites, and (2) information collected from your use of our products or services.

By using Control4's services or websites (including [www.control4.com](http://www.control4.com/), [my.control4.com](http://my.control4.com/) or other websites operated or controlled by Control4, collectively the "Site"), you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

Control4 may collect information about you any time you are in contact with Control4 or its affiliated companies, products, services or websites. Control4 may share this personal information with its affiliated companies (and vice versa) and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. Control4 and its affiliates may also combine your personal information with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.

### Information You Provide

We may ask you to provide personal information when you visit our Site, use our services or products, register for a program or service on the Site, place an order, subscribe to a newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form, or in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available from time to time. You may be asked for, as appropriate, your name, email address, mailing address, phone number and/or credit card information. Additionally, we may request information about the Control4 products you use, or third-party products connected to your Control4 system, such as model or serial numbers. In the case of a technical issue, we may also collect information relating to a support or service incident.

### Information Collected Automatically

To measure and improve the performance of our Site, we may also collect non-personal information during your visit to the Site through our automatic data collection tools, which may include Web beacons, cookies, embedded Web links, pixel tags and other commonly used information-gathering tools.

### Web Browser Cookies

A "cookie" is a small piece of data stored on a user's device, and contains non-personally identifiable information about the user. When you visit the Site, Control4 may place a "cookie" on your device in order to improve your experience by recognizing you when you visit the Site again, and in order to allow us to optimize the information presented based on your demonstrated areas of interest. Cookies may also be used to compile information about Site usage. This information can be used to enhance the content of the Site and make your experience more informative. If you subsequently provide us with your personal information, such as your email address, we will associate any cookies on your device with that information such that you will no longer be an anonymous visitor to the Site.

If you have set your browser to reject cookies, you can still use the Site, but you may need to re-enter information that would normally be obtained from the cookie (for example, your email address). You can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies. If you do, you will receive a warning message each time the Site attempts to place a cookie on your hard drive.

### Other Tracking Technologies

In some of our email messages we use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the Site. When a customer clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked this way, simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.

In addition we use pixel tags " tiny graphic images " to tell us what parts of our Site customers have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our Site. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format that customers can read. Pixel tags also tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that we're only sending messages that are of interest to our customers.

Our applications may include technology from Flurry Analytics. This technology provides us with information, reports and analysis about the usage, and browsing patterns of users of the Control4 products and allows us to track performance metrics in our mobile applications. Flurry may also record the type of device and operating system you are using, your general geographic information, as well as events that occur within our apps, such as how often you use our apps and other anonymous data. For more information about Flurry, its privacy policy and how to opt out of this service, please go to [www.flurry.com/about-us/legal/privacy.html](http://www.flurry.com/about-us/legal/privacy.html).

### WHEN WE DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

 _Generally_

Be assured that Control4 does not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers. Your personal information may be shared with legal entities within the Control4 group who are obligated to and will safeguard it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. There are also times when it may be advantageous for Control4 to make certain personal information about you available to companies with whom Control4 has a strategic relationship or that provide products and services to you on our behalf, including your Control4 dealer of record. These companies may help us process information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys. Control4 may also transfer its database, including personal information contained therein, to a third party who acquires all or substantially all of the assets or stock of Control4 whether by merger, acquisition, reorganization or otherwise.

 _In Connection with Legal Process or Investigation_

Control4 will disclose your personal information to a third party if required to do so by law or if, in good faith, Control4 believes that such action is necessary to: (I) comply with the law or with legal process; (ii) protect and defend Control4's rights and property or prevent fraud; (iii) protect Control4 against abuse, misuse or unauthorized use of Control4's products or services; or (iv) protect the personal safety or property of personnel, users or the public. Among other things, this means that if you provide false or deceptive registration information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you, including your computer's IP address, may be disclosed to a third party (including the recipient of an email) as part of any type of investigation into your actions.

Control4 abides by the safe harbor framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information collected from the European Union.
