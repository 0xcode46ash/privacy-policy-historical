#### Third-Party Service Providers

Portions of the Contentmart.in site may be operated by a third-party service provider ("Provider").

Provider logs standard technical information, such as the numerical Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site.

Our Provider also stores and organizes the personal information collected through this site on our behalf. The information remains under our control, and our agreement with Provider requires the information to be kept confidential and disclosed only to Provider's employees who require such access in the course of their assigned duties. Provider has however, not agreed to cooperate with Contentmart.in in seeking a protective order, if necessary, to protect this information from legal process. We will seek to accomplish this in all cases, but this cannot be guaranteed. Contentmart.in may change providers from time to time, and will transfer stored information to the new provider subject to similar restrictions.

Contentmart.in's search engine functionality is currently operated in house. All search queries may be retained for analysis and will always be access on an anonymous basis. Contentmart.in may however change the search engine provider from time to time.

From time to time, Contentmart.in may work with third-party consultants or other service providers who may have access to personally identifiable information. In such cases, we will restrict their use of personally identifiable information in accordance with their assigned tasks and subject to the limitations of this privacy policy.

Contentmart.in's site provides links to a wide variety of third-party websites. Contentmart.in is not responsible for, and does not have any control over, the privacy practices or the content of such third parties. We encourage users to read the privacy policies of any website visited.

We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address.
