Console Cheat Codes may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on ConsoleCheatCodes.com. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Console Cheat Codes. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Console Cheat Codes does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Console Cheat Codes to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. In addition, third-party advertisers may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
