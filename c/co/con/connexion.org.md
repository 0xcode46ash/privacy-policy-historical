You create a profile which is then linked to your friends and relatives to create your network. To do this we display certain information to people within the network such as your first name, age and any optional information you provide about yourself. Your email address is not shared with anyone unless you are asking them to connect to you as a friend or relative. Your date of birth is not shared with anyone except your immediate friends (and then only if you give permission), though your age is always shared.
