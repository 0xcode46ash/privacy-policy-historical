Connexion Privacy Policy

Connexion does not send Spam or sell or rent email addresses!

About the Information We Collect

Connexion is an social network that connects you to people through networks of your friends and relatives. You create a profile which is then linked to your friends and relatives to create your network. To do this we display certain information to people within the network such as your first name, age and any optional information you provide about yourself. Your email address is not shared with anyone unless you are asking them to connect to you as a friend or relative. Your date of birth is not shared with anyone except your immediate friends (and then only if you give permission), though your age is always shared.

Information Collected by Connexion

Connexion asks for certain information such as your name, email address, gender and date of birth.

Information Obtained from Your Computer

Connexion also collects the type and version number of your browser as well as your computer's IP address. We use this for general administration of the website only.

Sharing of Your Information

We do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information unless required by law.
