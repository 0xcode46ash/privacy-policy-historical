Last Updated: February 13, 2011

## Information Collection

Users are not required to first register an account with Conference Hound in order to search and retrieve conference information, or to use the majority of the site. We may choose to store the IP addresses of these users. 

Users have an option of logging in with their external LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook accounts in order to access enhanced site features that require user sign-in. For these users, we access and store information from their external user accounts, such as name, country of residence, zip code, birthdate, and more. We may also optionally collect usage information that will be used to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual visitor, as well as used to improve the Conference Hound site and our service. This information is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes without user consent. 

Conference Hound does not store any user passwords at any time. 

## Cookies

Like many websites, we also use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Conference Hound site and our service. 

Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Please keep in mind that the Conference Hound site may not fully function properly if cookies are turned off. 

## Information Sharing with Third Parties

We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data. 

Conference Hound cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Conference Hound or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law. 

## Links to Other Websites

The Conference Hound site contains links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit. 

## Changes to Privacy Policy

From time to time, Conference Hound will update its privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our website to notify you of these changes and we will use for these new purposes only data collected from the time of the policy change forward. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should review our website periodically.
