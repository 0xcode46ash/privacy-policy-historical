## Information Collection and Use

Contagious Communications Ltd. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

## Orders

We request information from the user before accepting orders. Here a user must provide contact information, such as their shipping address and email. This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfil customers' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. It is also important to note that all credit card details are entered on a secure site (Secure Trading, www.securetrading.com) where they are used for that single transaction.

## Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track user's movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may also log Browser Type and track page requests to enable us to improve the service we offer, but no information that is not specifically requested from the user is linked to personally identifiable information. 

## Sharing

We will share aggregate demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

## Links

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

## Security 

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information such as credit card numbers, the information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just surfing. To learn more about SSL, follow this link www.securetrading.com. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user- information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

## Emails and newsletters

We send all purchasers a confirmation email enclosing the details of their order. Customers will occasionally receive information on products, services and special deals as well as our weekly newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option not to receive these types of communications. 

## Site and Service Updates

We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their purchases via email or phone.

## Correction/Updating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your email address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavour to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done by emailing or calling our Customer Support Departments.

## Choice/Opt-in

Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-in' to receiving newsletters and other emails from Contagious Communications Ltd at the point where we ask for the information. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying with unsubscribe in the subject line of the email or emailing us at sales@contagiousmagazine.com.

## Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under which circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
