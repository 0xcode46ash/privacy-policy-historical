Converga Respects Your Privacy 

Converga respects your privacy. We want to make use of individual identifying information that you provide to us for purposes of serving you better. 

Individual identifying information is information that enables us to identify you, such as your email address, name, title, address etc. Converga uses the individual identifying information in order to personalise your experience on our website and also to be able to selectively send you communications that may be of interest to you, either electronically or otherwise.

Converga's policy regarding use of your individual identifying information supplied to us or collected via your experience at our online website covers these areas:

**1\. Notice and Disclosure**  
This Online Privacy Policy is made available to you in order to make you aware of how Converga collects and uses individual identifying information of visitors to Converga's website. 

Converga collects the following information regarding visitors to our website: domain name, name, information regarding what pages are accessed, information volunteered by you, such as survey information, email address and your preferred means of communication.   


Converga does make individual identifying information available to its business partners, for marketing purposes. Converga also uses such information to contact people for marketing purposes.

**2\. Choice/Consent**  
You have the choice to opt out of having individual identifying information provided in the registration process used for any purpose unrelated to the purpose for which the information was provided to us. Access to certain parts of Converga's web pages require a login and password. The use of those web pages, and the information downloadable from those sites, may be governed by a written agreement between you and/or your employer and Converga. Your individual identifying information may be retained by Converga to verify compliance with the agreement.

**3\. Data Security**  
Converga is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect the individual identifying information that you provide to us.

**4\. Use of Cookies**  
A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. 

Some parts of Converga use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of Converga information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. Converga does not correlate this information with data about individual users, nor does it share this information or sell it to any third party. 

If you prefer not to receive cookies on Converga, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use any area of the Converga web site.
