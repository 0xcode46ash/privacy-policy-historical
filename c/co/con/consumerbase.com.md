# ConsumerBase :: Behavior Driven. Proven Performance.

#### Privacy Policy

ConsumerBase has a deep commitment to the privacy of every individual about whom it holds information. Since we gather individual consumer data, we want users to fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how we correct or change it.

ConsumerBase and its employees assert that protecting consumer privacy is our greatest concern. We pledge to conduct our business according to the following principles:

**Consumer Rights**  
ConsumerBase understands the always-changing legalities and courtesies regarding the use and dissemination of our customer’s information.

**Compliance**  
ConsumerBase actively monitors all local laws in order to be compliant with any regulatory requirement.

**Ethical Relationships**  
ConsumerBase pledges to conduct our relationships with both clients and other information providers in an ethical and professional manner.

**Awareness**  
ConsumerBase is committed to education for our clients, our employees and the industry about the issues, guidelines and laws surrounding individual consumer rights to privacy and ConsumerBase's privacy policies.

**Accuracy**  
ConsumerBase maintains strict quality control and due diligence procedures to assure the integrity and accuracy of our information.

**Security**  
ConsumerBase maintains strict security procedures to ensure information will not be made available to any unauthorized person or business.

**Consumer Benefits**  
ConsumerBase offers services and information products that provide benefits to both consumers and businesses.

**Information Gathering and Tracking**   
ConsumerBase captures consumer information from our partners and our internal affiliates. This information is typically obtained through our partners' sites in connection with a user's registration on a particular site. The information captured allows for more targeted offers to consumers.

**Use of Information**  
ConsumerBase uses any information given by users of our partners’ and affiliate’s web sites in order to provide these users with information on products and/or services that may be of interest to them.

We may enhance or merge users’ personally identifiable information with data collected from other sources to use in direct or online marketing, including the data services described in "Sharing of Information" below. In the event we enhance or merge personally identifiable information with data collected from other sources, we will take all necessary steps to maintain the integrity and quality of that information.

**Sharing of Information**  
ConsumerBase uses the information described above to help our clients better understand the demographics of their target audiences as well as to support our marketing data products and services. We may provide personally identifiable data to marketing companies, advertising agencies, data compilers, data companies, and, to the extent permitted by law, individual reference and look-up service programs. Such information may be used by such companies to provide consumers with information on products and services that may be of interest.

If consumers in our database have indicated that they do not want to have their data shared with third parties, ConsumerBase will limit the use of their data to the suppression, validation and enhancement of existing information held by third parties about its users. For example, marketers may use data about a registrant provided by ConsumerBase, such as "opt-out" information, to suppress or drop the registered user's name from a file of potential customers. Additional information may be used to verify and/or validate the accuracy of existing data on the registrant that was lawfully acquired by a marketer. In addition, our data customers may use data supplied by ConsumerBase to enhance or append personally identifiable data to their file for use in direct or online marketing subject to the terms of their own privacy policies.

Exceptions may occur in the event of a merger, acquisition, sale of assets of ConsumerBase or any of its divisions as a going-concern, or change of control, in which case such data would be considered a business asset and would be transferred subject to the terms of this privacy policy. Nonetheless, our users will always have the opportunity to choose whether or not they want to receive further information and offers from any division within ConsumerBase or our marketing partners.

**Opt-out/Unsubscribe Policy**  
By registering with our partners or our affiliate site and to receive third party offers, users allow ConsumerBase and its affiliates to make their personally identifiable information available to third parties in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy. ConsumerBase provides users the option to opt-out from receiving information sent on behalf of third party advertisers by our internal affiliates or to opt-out from ConsumerBase and its divisions sharing information with advertisers or third party marketers for promotional purposes. Notwithstanding, all personally identifiable information provided by a user may be used by ConsumerBase to support its marketing data services business described above.

Users may unsubscribe to electronic mailings sent via our internal affiliates at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every newsletter or emailing. Users may opt-out of receiving further information sent on behalf of third party advertisers by our CustomOffers affiliate or from ConsumerBase sharing information with advertisers or third party marketers for promotional purposes. Currently, ConsumerBase does not offer users a means by which to completely delete personal data in order to maintain a master suppression file.

Please note that information sent on behalf of third party advertisers is prepared days in advance, so users may continue to receive email from our CustomOffers affiliate for up to 72 hours after they have un-subscribed.

**Security Policy**  
ConsumerBase maintains security guidelines to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information in its database. Access to personally identifiable information is only provided to authorized ConsumerBase employees. ConsumerBase employees are made aware of our security guidelines during our employee orientation process. Our security guidelines are reviewed at least quarterly based on our fiscal calendar.

With any specific questions regarding our privacy policy, we can be reached via e-mail at [privacy@ConsumerBase.com](mailto:privacy@ConsumerBase.com). ConsumerBase takes online privacy extremely seriously, and does not share the information users have submitted without their permission.

**Consumer Advocacy**  
We have a staff of Privacy Advocates that are available to assist our users with any privacy concerns they may have. Our privacy advocates take each individual’s concerns seriously and will ensure that any necessary steps are taken to resolve any potential conflicts.
