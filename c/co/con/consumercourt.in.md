> respected sir/madam,  
>  i own a bike of hero honda(cbz) of black color which was maintained perfectly. i noticed that a part of my silencer has been bulged and rust has been formed and some red liquid in the form of acid is leaking. on my 5th and 6th free service i told that complaint to my authorized dealer. they noted the complaint and they said that this is minor complaint and they will definitely change in the next service. due to some reasons i gave my bike late to the servicing but i changed all my spare parts time to time. but when i gave my bike this time they are telling that my warranty has been rejected due to not giving my bike in time for servicing. then why didn't they change my silencer in the 5th and 6th servicing. not only this they are not even responding properly. i told them that my gears are not properly working they gave answer like this that the gears of xtreme will be like this.   
>  not only this they even broke my footrest holder while servicing and they told that they will change it on Monday.  
>  i am very disappointed with this hero Honda services. please tell me what should i do.
