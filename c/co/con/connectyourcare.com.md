> Effective 9/29/2006

Welcome to the web site for ConnectYourCare. We recognize our obligation to protect the personal information you share via this web site and are committed to protecting your online privacy while providing you with the most useful internet experience possible. 

We do not share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties. We do not share your personal information for reasons unrelated to the servicing of this program, and we do not sell or rent any personal information collected. 

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
To conduct our business, we may collect personal information about you from applications or other forms, health plans and providers, your employer and our partners. In some circumstances, you may provide us with additional information yourself. 

We may use and disclose this information to affiliated third parties with which we contract for services, including your employer, to administer the program, evaluate and enhance the programs we offer and for certain other purposes as permitted by law. We will use or share only the minimum amount of personal information needed for a particular purpose. We contractually require affiliated third parties to protect your information. 

**Communications You May Receive**  
We will send you service-related announcements on those occasions when it is necessary to do so. We may contact you to provide information about treatment alternatives or other health-related benefits and services that may be of interest to you. 

**Links to Partner Sites**  
This site contains links to other sites. We do not share any information with our partners unless it is necessary for the performance of the program. We cannot guarantee, though, that links to sites we don't own or control have the same privacy practices, so we cannot assume responsibility for information our partners gather themselves. Be sure to read our partners’ privacy policies once you leave our website.

**Security Safeguards**  
We use extensive physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to make sure your personal information is secure. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that information to service this program or to properly conduct our business. We maintain safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect your information. 

It is our policy to send and receive personal information through encrypted channels only. All personal data used on this web site is processed using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. 

We will use or share only the minimum amount of personal health information needed for a particular purpose. We will continue to limit disclosures of your information in accordance with this Privacy Statement even after your relationship with us ends. 

**Privacy Complaints**  
If you feel we are not following our state policy, contact customer service at (877) 292-4040, your state or local consumer protection office or the Better Business Bureau. 

**Legal Disclaimer**  
We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, our homepage, or other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/ or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us or on our website.
