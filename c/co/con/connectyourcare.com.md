# Privacy Policy | ConnectYourCare

We recognize our obligation to protect the personal information you share via this website and are committed to protecting your online privacy while providing you with the most useful Internet experience possible.

#### Information Collection and Use

To conduct our business, we may collect personal information about you from applications or other forms, health plans and providers, your employer and our partners. In some circumstances, you may provide us with additional information yourself. We will not share this information with others using methods different than the methods described in this privacy statement.

#### Information Sharing and Disclosure

We may use and disclose information collected to affiliated third parties with which we contract for services, including your employer, to administer the program, evaluate and enhance the programs we offer and for certain other purposes as permitted by law. We will use or share only the minimum amount of personal information needed for a particular purpose. These parties are not permitted to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. We contractually require affiliated third parties to protect your information. We do not share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties or for reasons unrelated to the servicing of this program. We do not sell or rent any personal information collected whatsoever.

#### Registration

You must complete a registration to use our website or our mobile application. In order to register you will be required to give personally identifiable information such as date of birth and social security number. We collect this information to verify status and eligibility in order to fulfill claims. ConnectYourCare cannot process your claims or allow access to the secure portion of our website without the registration information.

#### Cookies

We utilize cookies to facilitate user navigation of our site. A cookie is a small text file containing information about you sent by a web server and stored on your hard drive in your browser. A majority of browsers will allow you to disable cookies or give you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. If you choose to disable cookies, functionality on the website may be diminished or may not work at all. The use of cookies by third party sites that you may access through a link from our site is not covered by this privacy statement.

#### Log Files

To comply with applicable laws and regulations, we record your IP addresses and login credentials when you access our site. The application logs all transaction-based activity regarding the date, time and user performing the transaction. Furthermore, changes to system configurations are logged for audit and quality control purposes. Our solution supports configurable logging levels.

###### The following data elements are logged by the system:

  * Event or transaction time — The date and time an event occurred
  * Transaction ID — A unique identification string is permanently assigned to a transaction

#### Links to Partner Sites

This site contains links to other sites. We do not share any information with our partners unless it is necessary for the performance of the program. We cannot guarantee, though, that links to sites we don’t own or control have the same privacy practices, so we cannot assume responsibility for information our partners gather themselves. Be sure to read our partners’ privacy policies once you leave our website.

#### Security Safeguards

We use extensive physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to make sure your personal information is secure. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that information to service this program or to properly conduct our business. All employees are trained on our security and privacy practices. We maintain safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect your information.

It is our policy to send and receive personal information through encrypted channels only. All personal data used on this web site is processed using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption.

We will use or share only the minimum amount of personal health information or personally identifiable information needed for a particular purpose. We will continue to limit disclosures of your information in accordance with this Privacy Statement even after your relationship with us ends.

#### Communications You May Receive

We will send you service-related announcements on those occasions when it is necessary to do so. We may contact you to provide information about treatment alternatives or other health-related benefits and services that may be of interest to you. Your employer may opt-out of receiving these types of communications. Please see our opt-out statement below.

#### Opt-in/Opt-out Choices

The employer has the option to turn on or off communication templates for their participant population as a whole.

Additionally, there are a few communication types that participants may control. For example, we offer a unique advanced alert service unmatched in the industry. Participants may elect to receive push notices sent through mobile text messaging. The participant may change these preferences at any time.

We offer three options for receiving participant statements. The employer may choose whether participants receive paper statements, eStatements, or paper statements with eStatements. Employers may also allow participants to choose between paper and eStatements. Participants are automatically enrolled in paper statements but can opt into eStatements online.

####  Surveys

We request information from users through conducting surveys semiannually. Participation in these surveys is voluntary. Survey information is used for product development and to improve the use and satisfaction of our website.

#### Updating Personal Information

If your personally identifiable information changes, you can update personal information that is provided to us by calling (877) 292-4040. Your personal information can also be updated through data provided to us from your employer.

#### Data Retention

We retain personal information necessary to provide you services. If you request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, your employer must contact their designated client services manager, who will coordinate the removal of said data. We will retain and use your personal information as required to fulfill our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

#### Privacy Complaints

If you feel we are not following our state policy, contact customer service at (877) 292-4040, your state or local consumer protection office or the Better Business Bureau.

#### Notification of Changes

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, our homepage, or other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

#### Legal Disclaimer

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/ or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us or on our website, as well as for the other reasons herein mentioned.
