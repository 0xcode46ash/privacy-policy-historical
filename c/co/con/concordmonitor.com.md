 **Our commitment to you  
**Concord Monitor Online and its owner, Concord Monitor Publishing Company (collectively, "Monitor Online"), recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about you, our customers. This customer privacy policy is intended to outline our legitimate business interests in collecting and using information versus your reasonable expectations of privacy.

**User Information**  
Our Web site can only gather personal information about you when you specifically provide it to us. We cannot obtain your e-mail address or your name, for instance. We do gather very general information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most often and what services users access the most. We only use such data in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for our users. We may share this aggregate information with our advertisers and collaborators, but only in an anonymous fashion, so that they too may understand how Monitor Online users, collectively, use our site and our services. 

**Personal Information**  
In some instances, such as when you sign up to use a service, enter a contest, purchase a product or submit feedback, we may need specific information about you, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, etc. We may use that information to make you aware of additional products and services which may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding site changes. We may also ask you for other information, such as your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, and your specific information needs, in an effort to deliver to you the best possible site experience. Of course, any of this additional information is obtained with your consent (usually via online forms).

**General Information Disclosure**  
Unless stated otherwise, we will use our best efforts not to disclose information about your individual visits to Monitor Online, or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, or credit card number to any outside parties unless otherwise required by law. But, we may record and share aggregated information with our partners as indicated above. Please be aware that any information submitted on a co-branded page with a third party may result in that third party using your information according to its privacy policy. We do not and cannot control such third party uses. Examples of third parties that Monitor Online currently utilizes are ZIP2 Corporation, Associated Press, Classified Warehouse and KOZ.com. 

**Cookies**  
Our traffic auditing tools use cookies to help track when a computer has contacted our site, the location of the connecting computer, and how many times the specific computer has been to Monitor Online. We use this information in an aggregated format to give an accurate traffic report to our advertisers. We also use it for editorial purposes, i.e. if a particular topic is popular, we may decide to improve our coverage of that topic.

**Third parties**  
We do not control the privacy policies of our business collaborators, advertisers, sponsors or other sites to which we provide links. Monitor Online users should also be aware that, when personal information is voluntarily disclosed in chat areas or bulletin boards on Monitor Online or any other Web site, that information may be collected by others and may result in unauthorized or unsolicited messages from others.

**Feedback**  
We have several feedback forms on Monitor Online. Any feedback that is submitted through these forms or through e-mail is the property of Monitor Online. We may use this feedback for marketing purposes, or to contact you for additional feedback. 

**Children**  
We do not specifically collect information about children. We believe that children should get their parents’ consent before giving out personal information. We further believe that parents should participate, and guide their children’s experience on Monitor Online.

**Privacy Policy Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post these changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about the Monitor Online’s privacy policy, please feel free to e-mail us at _[pbakke@cmointor.com](mailto:pbakke@cmointor.com)_ or call 603-224-5301 and speak to our online manager.
