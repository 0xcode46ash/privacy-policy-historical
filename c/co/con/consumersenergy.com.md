What is the Customer Data Privacy Policy? 

The Customer Data Privacy Policy was initiated at the request of the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) for the protection of Consumers Energy’s customer energy use data and personally identifiable information (PII).  The goal is to strike a reasonable balance between the collection, use or disclosure of any customer information by Consumers Energy while facilitating safe and reliable energy service, complying with new legislative mandates and meeting customers’ expectations regarding the collection, disclosure and use of their data and personal information. 

What types of information does Consumers Energy collect?
