# Privacy Policy

Your views matter to Conservatives. We have tried to make it as easy as possible for you to get in touch and let us know about the issues that really matter to you. We also want you to do this with confidence. We take privacy very seriously and want you to know exactly what happens to any information you send us.  
On this page, we set out:  
  
  1. _what information is collected about you when visiting our website_
  2. _the organization collecting the information_
  3. _how the information is used_
  4. _with whom the information may be shared_
  5. _what choices you have regarding its collection, use and distribution_
  6. _the security procedures in place to protect its loss, misuse or alteration_
  7. _how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information._

  
If you feel that we are not abiding by our privacy policy, please contact the webmaster in the first instance. His email address is [ **webmaster@conservative-party.org.uk**.](mailto:webmaster@conservative-party.org.uk)

If this does not resolve the matter, please contact the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Michael Ancram MP. His email address is [**chairman@conservative-party.org.uk**.](mailto:chairman@conservative-party.org.uk)

You can also write to the webmaster or the Chairman at:  
The Conservative Party, 32 Smith Square, London, SW1P 3HH.   
  
**Information Collection and Use**  
We are the sole owner of any information we collect. We never sell, share, or rent this information unless we first disclose the fact in this privacy statement.  
Keep up to date:  
We ask for your name, postcode and email address if you subscribe to our email newsletters. We use this information to contact you about conservatives.com and let you know what Conservatives are doing up and down the country.  
Donate, Join or Volunteer  
We need additional information if you want to donate money, join or volunteer. This includes contact information (such as your full postal address), payment information (such as your credit card number and expiry date) and personal information that we must collect to abide by legal and voluntary codes of conduct (such as the constituency in which you are registered to vote).   
Send to a friend  
If you choose, we can tell a friend about our site - or even a particular page if you prefer. To do this, we need to ask for your friend's name and email address. We shall send your friend a single email inviting them to visit the site or page you chose. We shall then destroy this information.   
Surveys and Contests  
Our site sometimes includes surveys or contests. You choose whether to take part and it is therefore always up to you whether you answer the questions and disclose contact information. We use your contact details to notify winners and award prizes. Your other answers help us improve the site and also ensure that Conservatives continue to tackle the issues that matter to you. We are committed to listening to Britain.  
Cookies  
We place a cookie (small file) on your hard drive when you visit the site so that it knows when you return to our site. This saves you re-entering information each time and also allows us to highlight parts of our site that we think might interest you.   
Log Files  
We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the system and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Even where it is possible, we do not use IP addresses in order to track the movement of individual users.  
**Links**  
Our web site links to other sites, but we shall always try to warn you when this is the case. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites: make sure you read their privacy statements if you are concerned about the information they are collecting about you. This statement only applies to our web site.   
**Security**  
We take every precaution to protect your details. When you submit sensitive information via the website, it is secure both on its way to us and once we receive it.  
For instance, our membership and donation forms encrypt your credit card number using the most advanced software available - 'secure socket layers' or SSL. If you use Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you can tell whether a page is secure by checking whether there is a locked padlock in the corner of your browser.  
We also do everything in our power to protect your information once we have received it. Our staff can only access your details if they have a specific job to perform, such as dealing with a membership enquiry. They also have to keep up to date on our security and privacy practices.

Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment behind a locked cage.   
  
**Supplementing Information**  
We take our responsibilities to protect you from fraud very seriously. To fulfil this obligation, we sometimes have to supplement the information you give us with information from third party sources - usually, in order to make sure that no-one else is using your credit card. We do not keep this information any longer than we have to.  
**Correction/Updating Personal Information**  
We recognise that details such as your post code or email address are bound to change over time. We will do what we can to ensure that you can change the information we hold about you.  
**Choice/Opt out**  
You will always be able to opt out of having your information used for any purpose other than that specifically related to the page where we ask for it. Our membership form, for instance, has an opt out mechanism so that you can join online without subscribing to our email list.  
If you ever want to stop us getting in touch, you can opt out by following the instructions at the foot of every email we send.  
**Notification of Changes**  
If we change our privacy policy, we shall post a link to those changes on our homepage so that you always know what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  
When we collect information from you, we tell you what we intend to do with it; if we later want to use that information for a different purpose, we shall first send you an email setting out our plans - and it will be up to you whether or not we do so.
