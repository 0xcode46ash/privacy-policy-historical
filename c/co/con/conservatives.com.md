| Data Collection and Use |   
  
The Conservative Party strives to meet 'P3P' standards (the 'Platform for Privacy Preferences Project') on data privacy. We are the sole owner of any information we collect. We never sell, share, or rent this information unless we first disclose the fact in this privacy statement. We collect data in nine different ways.

We collect your name and contact information (including postal & email address). At your option, we may also collect your gender and date of birth. This information is used for site customisation and contacting visitors (you may opt out of this usage). This data will be used by ourselves and our agents. 

Keep up to date

We ask for your name, postcode and email address if you subscribe to our email newsletters. We use this information to contact you about conservatives.com and let you know what Conservatives are doing up and down the country.

Join and Donate

In addition to the information from site registration we need additional information if you wish to donate money or join. This includes payment information (such as your credit card number and expiry date) and personal information that we must collect to abide by legal and voluntary codes of conduct (such as the constituency in which you are registered to vote). This information may be used for user analysis, user-profiling and contacting visitors.

If you donate more than £5,000 to the Party via the website, we are obliged under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act 2000 to report such a donation to the Electoral Commission, who will publish the fact that you have made a donation over £5,000.

A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.

| Links |   
  
Our website links to other sites, but we shall always try to warn you when this is the case. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites: make sure you read their privacy statements if you are concerned about the information they are collecting about you. This statement only applies to our website.   
  
| Security |   
  
We take every precaution to protect your details. When you submit sensitive information via the website, it is secure both on its way to us and once we receive it.

For instance, our membership and donation forms encrypt your credit card number using encryption technology called -- 'secure socket layers' or SSL. If you use Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you can tell whether a page is secure by checking whether there is a locked padlock or key in the right corner of your browser. The URL of the page you are viewing will also begin with https://.

We also do everything in our power to protect your information once we have received it. Our staff can only access your details if they have a specific job to perform, such as dealing with a membership enquiry. They also have to keep up to date on our security and privacy practices.

Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.  
  
| Supplementing Information |   
We take our responsibilities to protect you from fraud very seriously. To fulfil this obligation, we sometimes have to supplement the information you give us with information from third party sources - usually, in order to make sure that no-one else is using your credit card. We do not keep this information any longer than we have to.   
| Correcting/Updating Information |   
We recognise that details such as your post code or email address are bound to change over time. We will do what we can to ensure that you can change the information we hold about you.   
| Choice/Opt Out |   
  
You will always be able to opt out of having your information used for any purpose other than that specifically related to the page where we ask for it. Our membership form, for instance, has an opt out mechanism so that you can join online without subscribing to our email list.

If you ever want to stop us getting in touch, you can opt out by following the instructions at the foot of every email we send.   
  
| Notification of Changes |   
  
If we change our privacy policy, we shall post a link to those changes on our homepage so that you always know what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

When we collect information from you, we tell you what we intend to do with it; if we later want to use that information for a different purpose, we shall first send you an email setting out our plans - and it will be up to you whether or not we do so.
