[](https://web.archive.org/web/20080630211214id_/https%3A//www.continental.com/web/en-US/apps/vendors/out.aspx?i=bbbonline)  
Your information and site activity data is collected throughout Continental Web Sites, including domains, browsers, and pages accessed. This information is used for standard reporting purposes, to improve site content and to display and enhance your Continental experience. Continental Airlines participates in the Council of Better Business Bureau's BBBOnLineÂ® Privacy Program and is committed to the program's strict requirements regarding the treatment of personal information and to have that commitment verified by BBBOnLine. Further information about this program is available at [bbbonline.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20080630211214id_/https%3A//www.continental.com/web/en-US/apps/vendors/out.aspx?i=bbbonlinegeneral). In addition, Continental also adheres to the [Safe Harbor Principles](https://web.archive.org/web/20080630211214id_/https%3A//www.continental.com/web/en-US/apps/vendors/out.aspx?i=docsafeharbor) issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Individual information is captured on this site and retained for later use based on inputs to the "My Account" area of the site. Different information is needed to fulfill the programs and services offered in conjunction with the continental.com booking engine and OnePass Program. The information, its use and what you can do to change or update it is explained in more detail below.

**Continental Web Sites booking engines:** Information required by Continental Web Sites for the reservation, purchase and delivery of products and services that allow Continental to contact customers when necessary to complete the delivery of such products and services; to tailor your Continental experience; and to protect Continental from fraud are collected during the registration, shopping and purchase process. Names, mailing addresses, billing addresses, credit and charge card numbers and expiration dates, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, travel details, OnePass member number and other travel reward numbers are among the information collected.

Receipts and/or tickets will be mailed or sent by courier/express service to the billing or mailing address as appropriate. You may be contacted by telephone, mail or e-mail, if additional information is required to complete a transaction or to notify you of service changes.

"Cookies" are used to hold your preference information, maintain state during a transaction, and to enhance site security. Cookies and system-identification software enable us to:

  * Create a unique user ID for you. This saves you from having to sign in each time you visit the specific Continental Web site.
  * Keep track of a purchase transaction during a session at the specific Continental Web site.
  * Display OnePass Program interaction and pertinent offers.
  * Collect usage information about the way you like to use our Continental Web Sites that allows us to customize and improve the service.



Please note that for security and audit purposes, all information is archived.

**OnePass Information:** Aggregate information is collected throughout Continental Web Sites to provide you products and services associated with the OnePass program and Continental's services. There are two areas of the site in which information is captured and used at the individual level: "Enroll Instantly" and "My Account." If you join OnePass through "Enroll Instantly," data from the enrollment application is saved and you are assigned an individual OnePass account number. This information is used to administrate your mileage accrual and account information in this program, as well as to tailor your Continental experience. In "My Account," you may view your individual mileage balance and mileage earnings and withdrawals. All individual preferences entered in "My Account" are saved. In addition, the "My Account" area has an E-mail Subscription page that allows you to choose which types of e-mail you prefer to receive, if any. To protect your confidential information, you are assigned a Personal Identification Number (PIN)/Password (optional) upon activating your OnePass account. You are advised not to disclose your PIN/Password to any third party. If you do not know your PIN/Password use our online [online PIN help tools](https://web.archive.org/web/20080630211214id_/https%3A//www.continental.com/web/en-US/apps/account/settings/pin/pinResolution.aspx), or [contact the OnePass Service Center](https://web.archive.org/web/20080630211214id_/https%3A//www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/contact/onepass/AccountInfo.aspx) for assistance.

**OnePass Online Auction:** Information required for item searches, bidding and delivery of products and services upon successful bid, to allow Continental or an agent of Continental to contact customers when necessary, to tailor the user experience, and to protect Continental from fraud are collected during the registration and bidding process. Names, shipping address, billing address, credit card numbers and expiration dates, e-mail address, telephone numbers, travel details, OnePass and other travel reward numbers are among the information collected. Confirmation notices will be electronically mailed to the account email address or sent via courier/express service to the billing or shipping address as appropriate. Users may be contacted by telephone, mail, or email if additional information is required to complete a transaction. Users may be notified by telephone, mail, or email of service changes. During the registration process, users may request that Continental periodically send promotion notification via e-mail. Cookies are used to hold user preference information, maintain state during a transaction, and to enhance site security. For security and audit purposes, all information is archived.

**E-mail Address Usage:** Your e-mail address is required for reservations made on continental.com to be used for identification and in the event Continental needs to contact you. Your e-mail address is also required when creating an OnePass account. The e-mail address provided at enrollment is retained as your primary e-mail address. Once a primary e-mail address is assigned to your OnePass account, it cannot be deleted unless your account is closed via the OnePass Service Center, but may be edited through continental.com. If there is no e-mail address associated with your account and you add one, it is automatically designated as your primary e-mail address.
