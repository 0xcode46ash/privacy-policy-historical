#### Information gathered by Continental Airlines on Continental Web Sites

Your information and site activity data is collected throughout Continental Web Sites, including domains, browsers, and pages accessed. This information is used for standard reporting purposes, to improve site content and to display and enhance your Continental experience. With respect to the foregoing, Continental adheres to the [Safe Harbor Principles](http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/SHList.nsf/9bdf89bec30e8e04852569670050e019/99ef804ab8159c3585256d080067edfd?OpenDocument) issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce. In compliance with the obligations that arise pursuant to the "Enforcement" principle of the Safe Harbor program, Continental operates an in-house verification process that satisfies the Safe Harbor requirements.

Individual information is captured on this site and retained for later use based on inputs to the "My Account" area of the site. Different information is needed to fulfill the programs and services offered in conjunction with the continental.com booking engine and OnePass Program. The information, its use and what you can do to change or update it is explained in more detail below.

**Continental Web Sites booking engines:** Information required by Continental Web Sites for the reservation, purchase and delivery of products and services that allow Continental to contact customers when necessary to complete the delivery of such products and services; to tailor your Continental experience; and to protect Continental from fraud are collected during the registration, shopping and purchase process.

Receipts and/or tickets will be mailed or sent by courier/express service to the billing or mailing address as appropriate. You may be contacted by telephone, mail or e-mail, if additional information is required to complete a transaction or to notify you of service changes.

"Cookies" are used to hold your preference information, maintain state during a transaction, and to enhance site security. Cookies and system-identification software enable us to:

  * Create a unique user ID for you. This saves you from having to sign in each time you visit the specific Continental Web site.
  * Keep track of a purchase transaction during a session at the specific Continental Web site.
  * Display OnePass Program interaction and pertinent offers.
  * Collect usage information about the way you like to use our Continental Web Sites that allows us to customize and improve the service.



Please note that for security and audit purposes, all information is archived.

**OnePass Information:** Aggregate information is collected throughout Continental Web Sites to provide you products and services associated with the OnePass program and Continental's services. There are two areas of the site in which information is captured and used at the individual level: "Enroll Instantly" and "My Account." If you join OnePass through "Enroll Instantly," data from the enrollment application is saved and you are assigned an individual OnePass account number. This information is used to administrate your mileage accrual and account information in this program, as well as to tailor your Continental experience. In "My Account," you may view your individual mileage balance and mileage earnings and withdrawals. All individual preferences entered in "My Account" are saved. In addition, the "My Account" area has an E-mail Subscription page that allows you to choose which types of e-mail you prefer to receive, if any. To protect your confidential information, you are assigned a Personal Identification Number (PIN)/Password (optional) upon activating your OnePass account. You are advised not to disclose your PIN/Password to any third party. If you do not know your PIN/Password use our [online PIN help tools](https://web.archive.org/web/20101224074003id_/http%3A//www.continental.com/web/en-US/apps/account/settings/pin/pinResolution2.aspx?SID=36F15676D4CD4307AF91BF04E95C553F), or [contact the OnePass Service Center](https://web.archive.org/web/20101224074003id_/http%3A//www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/contact/onepass/AccountInfo.aspx?SID=36F15676D4CD4307AF91BF04E95C553F) for assistance.

**OnePass Online Auction:** Information required for item searches, bidding and delivery of products and services upon successful bid, to allow Continental or an agent of Continental to contact customers when necessary, to tailor the user experience, and to protect Continental from fraud are collected during the registration and bidding process. Names, shipping address, billing address, credit card numbers and expiration dates, e-mail address, telephone numbers, travel details, OnePass and other travel reward numbers are among the information collected. Confirmation notices will be electronically mailed to the account email address or sent via courier/express service to the billing or shipping address as appropriate. Users may be contacted by telephone, mail, or email if additional information is required to complete a transaction. Users may be notified by telephone, mail, or email of service changes. During the registration process, users may request that Continental periodically send promotion notification via e-mail. Cookies are used to hold user preference information, maintain state during a transaction, and to enhance site security. For security and audit purposes, all information is archived.

**E-mail Address Usage:** Your e-mail address is required for reservations made on continental.com to be used for identification and in the event Continental needs to contact you. Your e-mail address is also required when creating an OnePass account. The e-mail address provided at enrollment is retained as your primary e-mail address. Once a primary e-mail address is assigned to your OnePass account, it cannot be deleted unless your account is closed via the OnePass Service Center, but may be edited through continental.com. If there is no e-mail address associated with your account and you add one, it is automatically designated as your primary e-mail address.

  * the processing of any personal and sensitive data included in the data you provide.

**Third Party Information Provided by You:** If, during the course of completing a transaction with Continental, you provide us with personally identifiable information pertaining to a third party (for example, you make a reservation for your daughter), such third party information will be used by Continental solely for the completion of that transaction.

#### Disclosure of information gathered by Continental Airlines

Continental will not sell your personally identifiable information. Continental will also not share your personally identifiable information with third parties without your permission, except as outlined for OnePass members in the Member's Guide or otherwise disclosed in Continental's Privacy Policy. Aggregate information may at times be shared with Continental partners and other third parties. Aggregate information includes items like demographic information, domain names, and other site traffic information, but does not include personally identifiable information. Some examples are: X% of subscribers are America Online users, or X% of eligible tickets purchased are eTickets.

#### Use of Third-Party Service Providers

Continental contracts with reputable third parties to facilitate the collection and aggregation of Web usage and transaction information; the distribution of advertisements and electronic mail; and the operation of some survey, promotional and sweepstakes programs. Such third parties are subject to confidentiality and any necessary privacy requirements and, upon completion of these services, all information is returned to Continental.

#### Use of Web Bugs

Web documents may reference images, sometimes called "single-pixel GIFs" or "Web bugs" that streamline the collection of Web usage information. Continental uses Web bugs to send usage information directly to our advertising and E-mail Service Providers. This helps us better manage our efforts to advertise and communicate by e-mail by providing a better understanding of which banner ads or e-mail bring users to Continental Web Sites.

Continental has engaged third party tracking and advertising providers such as DoubleClick to act on Continental's behalf to track and analyze your usage of our sites through the use of cookies, pixel tags/ web beacons, and similar technologies. These third parties collect, and share with us, as we may request, web site usage information about visits to our sites, measure and research the effectiveness of our advertisements, track page usage and paths followed during visits through our sites, help us target our Internet banner advertisements on our sites and on other sites, and track use of our Internet banner advertisements and other links from our marketing partners' sites to our sites. The information collected on Continental’s behalf by these third parties does not contain your name, address, e-mail address, or any other personally identifiable information. If you wish, however, you may [opt out of DoubleClick tracking](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx?SID=36F15676D4CD4307AF91BF04E95C553F).
