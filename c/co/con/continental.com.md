# Continental Airlines -- Continental On-Line Privacy Policy

### Information gathered by Continental On-Line

User information and site activity data is collected throughout the web site, including domains, browsers, and pages accessed. This information is used for standard reporting purposes and to improve site content and display. 

There are three areas of the site where individual information is captured and retained for later use: CO.O.L. Travel Assistant, CO.O.L. Travel Specials, and the OnePass member area. Different information is needed for each of these programs and is currently held in separate databases. The information, how it gets used, and what you can do to change or update it is explained in more detail below. 

**CO.O.L. Travel Assistant:** Information required for the reservation, purchase and delivery of products and services, to allow Continental to contact customers when necessary, to tailor the user experience, and to protect Continental from fraud are collected during the registration, shopping and purchase process. Names, shipping address, billing address, credit card numbers and expiration dates, e-mail address, telephone numbers, travel details, OnePass and other travel reward numbers are among the information collected. 

Receipts and/or tickets will be mailed or sent via courier/express service to the billing or shipping address as appropriate. Users may be contacted by telephone, mail, or email if additional information is required to complete a transaction. Users may be notified by telephone, mail, or email of service changes. During the registration procedure, users may request that Continental periodically send promotion notification via e-mail. 

Cookies are used to hold user preference information, maintain state during a transaction, and to enhance site security. 'Cookies' and system-identification software enable us to: 

  * Create a unique user ID for you. This saves you from having to log-in each time you visit the site. 
  * Keep track of a purchase transaction during a session at the Website. 
  * Collect usage information about the way you like to use our Website. This allows us to customize and improve the service 



For security and audit purposes, all information is archived. 

**CO.O.L. Travel Specials:** Information required for the delivery of the offers, to tailor the user experience, and to protect Continental from fraud is collected in the subscription process. This includes name, e-mail address, Zip Code, OnePass number, offers of interest. Personal information in this database is not shared or sold to other parties, except to the extent required by law. 

Information is used to send scheduled e-mail of discount offers on Continental and it's partners. Occasional unscheduled e-mail may be sent when required for timely notification of offers, or for notification of changes to the service. Other Continental or third party offers may be included in the CO.O.L. Travel Specials mailings. All information is regularly reviewed in order to help us improve the offers and the service. Information is also used to tailor the user experience, including the e-mail messages and the web site. 

Information required for on-line reservation and ticket purchase is not shared or sold to other parties, except to the extent required by law. 

For security and audit purposes, all information is archived. 

**OnePass Information:** Aggregate information is collected throughout the OnePass area of the Continental web site. There are two areas of the site in which information is captured and used at the individual level: "Enroll Instantly" and "Your Account". If you join OnePass through "Enroll Instantly", data from the enrollment application is saved and you are assigned an individual OnePass account number. This information is used to maintain your mileage accrual in this program. In "Your Account", you may view your individual mileage balance, and mileage earnings and withdrawals. In addition, the "Your Account" area has a communications page that allows you to choose which types of e-mail you prefer to receive, if any at all. Your individual preferences are saved. To protect your confidential information, you are assigned a Personal Identification Number (PIN) upon activating your OnePass account. You are advised not to disclose your PIN to any third party. If you do not know your PIN, you should contact the OnePass Service Center at [onepass@opsc.flycontinental.com](mailto:onepass@opsc.flycontinental.com). 

### Use of information gathered by Continental On-Line

**E-mail Addresses:** E-mail addresses are only collected when voluntarily provided. As such, if you do not wish to receive e-mails from us, we ask that you do not provide your e-mail address. An e-mail address is required when subscribing to the CO.O.L. Travel Special e-mail notification service. When registering for the CO.O.L. Travel Assistant, your e-mail address is required and is used for identification and in the event Continental needs to contact you. Your e-mail address is NOT required anywhere in the OnePass pages. 

**Confidential Information:** Individual information you supply through the OnePass web site area follows the same standards as member information supplied through phone or mail. (OnePass members receive a Member's Guide upon activating a OnePass account that states this same policy.) From time to time, individual information may be shared with OnePass partners in order to provide members with more opportunities to earn miles and other benefits associated with OnePass membership. If you choose to keep your information private, please contact the OnePass Service Center by e-mail, phone, or mail: 

> **Continental feedback forms:** Questions and comments submitted online may be published in the Continental Magazine, Continental On-Line, or other publications if Continental feels that they are of a topic of interest to the audience. Examples include on-line FAQ's and the letters section of Continental Magazine. Personally identifiable information will only be published if Continental has the user's explicit permission. 

All feedback is reviewed. Individuals may be contacted by Continental if requested by the user, or if Continental feels contact is warranted by the message. Both aggregate and individual comments are used to help improve Continental On-Line and other Continental products and services. 

For security and audit purposes, all contact information is archived.
