Con Edison Internet Privacy Statement

Thank you for visiting the Con Edison Web site and reviewing our privacy policy. Con Edison is committed to your privacy and security. 

Con Edison has created this privacy statement to help you understand how we collect and use information when you visit www.coned.com: 

How We Protect Your Privacy

Personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit ("customer information") is used solely for Con Edison's purposes. We do not sell or otherwise share customer lists, and will not disclose your customer information to third parties that may want to market products or services to you. We may, however, need to share specific information with third-party business partners or contractors when that information is required in order to answer your inquiry, to fulfill your request for a product or service, or to otherwise conduct our business with you, including the collection of payment from you. 

In addition, though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law or to comply with a judicial proceeding, a subpoena, a court order, or other legal process. 

Con Edison has implemented policy guidelines and security features to access specific customer-account information and to help safeguard customer-specific account information from unauthorized access or improper use.

We use this information to respond to your requests and to transact business with you.
