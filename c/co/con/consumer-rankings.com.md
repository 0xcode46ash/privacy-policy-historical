# Privacy Policy | Consumer-Rankings

Consumer-rankings.com respects your privacy and our goal is to maintain your trust when handling your personal information. This Privacy Policy is part of our Terms of Use and it is intended to inform you, the end user, about how we handle this information.

### Collected Information

You have the option of providing us various types of information through the website. This information may include:

  * Personally Identifiable Information: Information that can be used to identify you or enable someone to contact you, such as (but not limited to) your name, address, email address, telephone number.
  * Non-Personally Identifiable Information: Information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity. This may include 
    * Profile Information: Information about your profile and demographics, such as (but not limited to), your age, education and marital status.
    * Behavior Information: Information regarding your needs, preferences, views and selections, such as (but not limited to) information we use to identify the products, services and choices that are right for you or your actual selections of the options we provide.



We collect all these forms of information when you knowingly submit them into an online form, click a link or make any other action on the website. We may store the information in our systems.

### Use of Collected Information

The Non-Personally Identifiable Information that we collect is used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content in an effort to create a more personally relevant experience. The information is also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals.

If you elect to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information, we may utilize such information for marketing purposes, and this use may result in follow-up communications (by mail and/or email and/or phone) from us and from our clients. In addition, that information may be combined with information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to your preferences and behaviors, and for other sales and marketing efforts.

### Sharing Information with Third Parties

All personally identifiable information you provide is maintained in confidence. There are instances, however, in which your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, as described below.

Your non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners on an anonymous basis.

When you request information from us or one or more of our clients, we may transfer that information so that our clients may provide the information on their product or service that you requested.

We may also disclose information to a third party who provides substantially similar services as the original service about which you requested more information. In such situations, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that we are very careful in selecting companies with whom we do business.

In addition to the above situations where your information may be shared with others, there is also the possibility that we may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company. In the event of such transaction, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to all collected personally identifiable information.

Finally, we may share your information as necessary to comply with a court order or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.

### Choice

  * Non-Personally Identifiable Information - Use of Cookies & Opting-Out



In order to monitor and improve the experience of our website and services, we may use several in-house and third-party tracking technologies and tools, such as cookies, “clear GIFs”, Web beacons, and the analysis of log files. Some of our Site pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that is put on your computer’s hard drive that may be used, for example, to collect information about site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall personal information previously indicated by a user and correlate the browsing data with other collected information. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. Furthermore, you may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. Please note, however, that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, your usage experience might be affected and there might be a chance that the website will not be functional for you.

  * Personally Identifiable Information - Opting-Out



You may choose whether or not to provide personally identifiable information. If you choose to provide such information you have the right to tell us not to make some of the uses of such information described herein or may have such information deleted in its entirety. If you no longer wish to receive advertising and promotional emails from us, by clicking on the opt-out email link provided on all email communications from us. To have your personal information completely removed from our databases, simply contact us at removedata@consumer-rankings.com and provide your full name, mailing address, phone number and email address so that we may identify you in the opt-out process. Once we receive your instruction, we will promptly take corrective action. Please note that we will remove your information from the “live” database, but some information may remain in our archives.

### Supplementing and Correlating Your Information with Information from Other Sources

We may combine the Information you provided us with third-party data. Here are some typical scenarios for such integration:

  * Correlate your IP address with your geographic location using an external database.
  * Receiving and processing information about your behavior and actions in other websites. For example, when you click a link from our website to another website, the other website may inform us that you made an action (such as purchase) as result of that link, and we may store and use that information.
  * Getting additional information about you from other sources. For example, when you provide us with your name and address we may verify that they match, based on external databases and information sources.



### Other Websites and Linked Websites

Third parties, such as partners, advertisers, sponsors, and other sources accessible through our website and services may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. We are not responsible for any actions, content of privacy policies and practices of such third parties, which may be different than ours. We advise you to check and review the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing any information to any third party.

### Children's Privacy

In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), Consumer-rankings.com is not structured to attract children. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personally Identifiable Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age.

### Security

We take reasonable measures to secure your Personal Identifiable Information, using industry-standard methods. However, due to the nature of Web-based applications, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will fully eliminate security risks associated with your data.
