# Privacy policy at confetti.co.uk

This page explains the privacy policy for Confetti Network Ltd (80 - 81 Tottenham Court Road, London, W1T 4TE). Confetti respects the importance of your privacy, and the privacy of all its customers. This privacy policy will explain how we gather and use any information you give to us, and what you can do about it. 

### What information we gather

If you are browsing our site, reading articles or looking through our shop without being a registered user, we gather no personal information about you. All we will gather is the standard HTTP information that will appear in our web logs, though we will use unique identifiers for the purpose of identifying an individual user. Only when you register will we actually require you to give us personal details like email, password, name, title and address. Once you are a member, you have the option to submit further details. If you are purchasing anything from our shop, we will require you to provide information that will assist the transaction, such as delivery address details and credit card information. 

### Why we gather information

Much of the information we gather is required in order to run our business. For example, you will need to submit your personal details and credit card in order to buy products from us. Confetti encourages you to submit some personal details and become a member for the following reasons. This will:

  * enable you to personalise parts of the site and extend the functionality of different sections. 
  * identify you for the purpose of buying products, entering competitions, signing up for events, requesting further information from companies advertising on our site, and controlling the use of our forums. 
  * tailor specific marketing towards you in the form of emails you have requested and catalogue mailings. 



We will analyse the data you submit to enable us to develop our business. An example of this might be “what are the most popular pages on our site”, or “How many users who register do so to buy products”. 

### What access you have to your information 

You have access to any information that you submitted when you signed up to become a member of Confetti. You can request to be unregistered from our database at anytime. This will involve us removing any personal information that you gave to us when becoming a member. You can unsubscribe from any emails we are sending you at any time.

### Who receives the data

We offer you the option of receiving information from carefully selected third parties when you register with us. If you agree to this when you register, but change your mind later, you can amend your preferences accordingly. If you are shopping with us, the only third parties we will contact are those required to complete the transaction. This will include your credit card provider, delivery organisations, and suppliers that we use to source personalised products such as personalised stationery.

### How long we store personal information for

We will store information about you as long as we require it to carry out our business. Please be reassured that we can remove certain information if you request it. Please see point 3). 

### How you can contact us

You can contact our customer service team at [cutomercare@confetti.co.uk](mailto:cutomercare@confetti.co.uk "mailto:cutomercare@confetti.co.uk") or phone 0870 840 6060 Monday – Friday 9am to 5pm. 

### Cookies 

Confetti requires the use of cookies for its site to function. They are used to identify an individual as they use the site. Some of these cookies exist only whilst you have the browser open as they are destroyed once it is closed. Others are there permanently, or at least until you destroy the cookies yourself using your browser. These cookies may be disabled, but this might result in certain sections of the site being unavailable to you. The cookies we use should not disclose any of your personal details.

### The Data Protection Act
