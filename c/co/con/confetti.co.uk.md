We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site. We collect this information in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website. We will not associate any data gathered from this site with any personally identifying information from any source. If we do want to collect personally identifiable information through our website, we will be up front about this. We will make it clear when we collect personal information and will explain what we intend to do with it.

### Customers Who Place Orders with Us

When a customer places an order with us, we collect address and payment information in order to process the order and dispatch the goods. This information is also kept indefinately, to allow us to deal with any issues in the relation to the order, or to process a return or replacement of any goods.

### People Who Call Us

When you call Confetti customer services we collect Calling Line Identification (CLI) information. We use this information to help improve its efficiency and effectiveness.

### Visitors or Customers Who Send a Review, Compliment or Compaint to Us

When we receive a review, compliment or complaint from a person we keep the information we receive within emails. This normally contains the identity of the complainant and any other individuals involved.

We will only use the personal information we collect to process the complaint and to check on the level of service we provide. We may also use this information on our testimonial or review pages.

### People Who Use Confetti Services

Confetti offers various services to visitors. For example, we offer planning tools, provide a forum for visitors to communicate with each other and distribute electronic newsletters and emails containing product offers. Information stored within the planning tools and forums may be used to tailor the experience that you receive to highlight products and services that are likely to be most appropriate for you. We use a third party to manage to sending of some emails, but they are only allowed to use the information to send out our emails.

We have to hold the details of the people who have requested our services in order to provide it. However, we only use these details to provide the service the person has requested and for other closely related purposes. For example, we might use a person’s wedding date to work out when they are likely to be interested in looking at table decorations. When people do subscribe to our services, they can cancel their subscription at any time and are given an easy way of doing this.

### Job Applicants, Current and Former Confetti Employees

When individuals apply to work at Confetti, we will only use the information they supply to us to process their application and to monitor recruitment statistics. Where we want to disclose information to a third party, for example where we want to take up a reference or obtain a ‘disclosure’ from the Criminal Records Bureau we will not do so without informing them beforehand unless the disclosure is required by law.

Personal information about unsuccessful candidates will be held for 12 months after the recruitment exercise has been completed, it will then be destroyed or deleted. We retain de-personalised statistical information about applicants to help inform our recruitment activities, but no individuals are identifiable from that data.

Once a person has taken up employment with the Confetti, we will compile a file relating to their employment. The information contained in this will be kept secure and will only be used for purposes directly relevant to that person’s employment. Once their employment with Confetti has ended, we will retain the file in accordance with the requirements of our retention schedule and then delete it.
