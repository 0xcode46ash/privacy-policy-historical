Your privacy is important to us. We know that you care about how information about you is used. We want to share with you the Internet policies and practices we have adopted to protect your privacy so that you feel confident about how we handle the personal information you entrust to us online.

While we do not plan to modify our policies very often, it is always advisable to double-check when you visit our site to be sure that you have read and agree with our most current policy statement. Any change in our privacy policy will be prospective only. We will not make any changes that have retroactive effect unless legally required to do so.

The content on our site may include, among other items of interest, video clips, message boards, scrapbooks, chats, surveys, sweepstakes, and contests. We hope that you enjoy [www.contiki.com](http://www.contiki.com/)Â and will come back often to visit!

 **Collection**  
We only collect personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, demographic information (region/country from), interests, taste or preference information, and the like, when voluntarily submitted by a visitor. Visitors may choose to submit personal information to enter contests, to obtain information or submit a comment, to register for a loyalty program or to place a travel availability request.

**Use of Information & Disclosure  
**Providing personal information is up to you, our visitor. We will collect personally identifiable information provided by you to notify you of results, to e-mail you with updates and news, to respond to your questions or comments or travel requests, to send out brochures and other information on our products, and to enter you in contests. We ask visitors providing e-mail addresses to let us know if they would like further information or updates from our site; only those who request it will receive follow-up e-mail or other communications from us. We also offer visitors an "opt-out" option at any time they wish to cease receiving e-mails or other information from us.

We never sell or give the information that you voluntarily provide us to any third party. It is used solely by us, our agents or business partners to respond to your requests and to better serve you.

**"Cookies" and Other Web Technologies**  
We use "cookie" technology and IP addresses only to obtain non-personal information from on-line visitors to provide them with the best possible personalized on-line experience. To do this we do keep track of the type of browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape) and operating system (e.g., Windows, Macintosh) used by the visitor, and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider. We also track the total number of visitors to our site in an aggregate form to allow us to update and improve our site; personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process. This helps us keep our site fresh and interesting to our visitors. Cookie technology also helps us deliver content tailored to a visitor's interests. You may disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do disable cookies, we may be unable to optimize your visit to our site and you may experience some errors.

**Message Boards and Chat**  
We offer message boards and Chat for our travelers' enjoyment. As we are sure you are aware, anything you post online is available for the world to see. We make no representations and undertake no obligations as to information you voluntarily post. By posting a message on the our site, you understand it becomes public domain and therefore may be used by Contiki for marketing purposes.

**Safeguards**  
We have instituted safeguards to check that our internal procedures meet our high policy standards. We also use our best efforts to be sure that third parties who work with us agree to protect personal information that they must access in order to serve our site and our visitors.

**Links To Other Sites**  
We rarely offer links to other sites, but when we do, we try to link only with partner sites that share our values. Nevertheless, we are not responsible for the content or information collection policies of other sites including any links from traveler homepages posted on the message boards. If you visit another site, you should review their privacy and other policies.

**Other Information**  
We reserve the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the site, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any legal investigation.

**Questions**  
If you would like us to update, change, or delete information we have about you (subject to any applicable legal exceptions), would like to opt out of receiving further information, or have questions about our privacy policy, please send an e-mail to: [webmaster@contiki.com](mailto:webmaster@contiki.com). We have offices worldwide who correspond with travelers so please be very specific about your query.
