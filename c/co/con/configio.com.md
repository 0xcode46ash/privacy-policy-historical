This policy does not apply to information collected by third parties linked or otherwise connected in any way to the Website. Configio has no control over, and no responsibility or liability for, any third party’s collection, use, disclosure, or retention of the personal information that is provided directly to them, and that collection, use, disclosure, and retention is not subject to this policy.

The Website may automatically collect certain information from users through the use of “cookies” and other tracking mechanisms. Information automatically collected may include, but is not limited to: your domain name and host for Internet access; the Internet address of the site from which you came; the date and time you visit the Website and the pages you visit; your computer’s IP address and information about its operating system, browser and host.

##### **Information That You Specifically Provide**

It is your choice whether to provide personal information to Configio. Some information must be provided in order to participate in certain programs or activities, so the decision not to provide information might limit or eliminate certain functions of the Website or the ability to participate. The types of personal information that Configio may request about you include, but are not limited to: your name, email address, phone number, organization name, job title, physical address, mailing address, and age.

##### **Information You Provide About Others**

Do not provide personal information about others unless you are authorized or required to do so by applicable law or contract. Before supplying personal information about others, you and the person about whom you supply the information must review and consent to the Terms of Use of the Website. By submitting any personal information about others, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so, that you have made the Terms of Use available to the person about whom you supply the information, and that you have obtained that person’s written consent to our Terms of Use. If applicable law allows you to supply the information without doing the foregoing, you represent and warrant that you have abided by that law and that it allows us to receive and disclose the information under this Privacy Policy without any further action on our part. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Configio, its parents, officers, directors, employees and agents, sponsors and supporting artists, licensors and suppliers for any failure by you to comply with this paragraph.

##### **Use of Information**

Configio may use information collected on the Website, which may include information gathered about you, for various purposes. In general, Configio uses personal information it collects to pursue its business and operations, including marketing and promotion activities, and to engage in related activities. You should assume that Configio will use all information for all lawful purposes.

We reserve the right, but do not undertake a duty, to notify you of court orders, subpoenas or other legal process if allowed. If you do not want us to respond to legal process compelling us to disclose your information, you need to seek a valid order permitting us to refuse to disclose it and serve the order on us at least 3 business days before the response deadline.

We reserve the right to use, disclose, retain, share, sell and otherwise deal with all information collected via the Website internally or to third parties, for any lawful purpose or to prevent harm to us or others. For example, and without limitation, in our discretion we may:

Disclose information to service providers and others in order to deal with requests and questions from you; to personalize or enhance transactions; to verify, process, store, enforce, investigate and/or collect actual or potential transactions; and to assist or respond to our consultants (including auditors and lenders).

Disclose information to government regulators, law enforcement authorities or alleged victims of identify theft, as well as voluntary disclosures;

Disclose any matter relating to the Website not listed in this Privacy Policy, but which is not prohibited by law from being disclosed.

Configio does not purport to have listed all possible disclosures that Configio might make. This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand our general practices. This Privacy Policy is not a promise that your information will never be disclosed except as described above. For example, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access information transmitted to or contained on the Website, technologies may malfunction or not work as anticipated, or someone might access, abuse or misuse information, despite a lack of permission. Although Configio uses what we believe to be commercially reasonable practices to protect your privacy, that does not mean, and you should not expect it to mean, that your information or communications will always be private or protected.

Configio generally will retain information for as long as required, allowed or for as long as Configio believes it useful. If you cease using the Website, or your permission to use the Website is terminated, Configio may continue to use and disclose your personal information in accordance with this Policy as amended from time to time. Configio does not undertake retention obligations through this Privacy Policy. Configio may dispose of information in our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law.

##### **Cookies**

Configio may place a “cookie” on the browser of your computer. Cookies are a technology that installs a small amount of information on the computer of a website user to permit the website to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies may enhance the convenience and use of the Website. For example, the information provided through cookies may be used to recognize you as a previous user of the Website (so you do not have to enter your personal information every time), offer personalized information for your use, and otherwise facilitate your experience using the Website. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your ability to access or use certain features of the Website. Configio may also use transparent images, and log file information to store user information, customize content, or monitor Website activity.

Third-party advertisements may be displayed on the Website, which may contain cookies or other information-gathering technologies. Configio has no control over, and no responsibility or liability for, the cookies or other technologies used in the advertisements or for the use and disclosure of information collected through advertisement cookies or other technologies.

##### **Other Websites**

The Website may contain links to other websites or Internet resources. When you click on one of those links you are contacting another website. Configio has no control over, and no responsibility or liability for, other websites or their collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.

##### **Privacy Policy Incorporated in Terms of Use**

Your use of the Website is governed by the Configio Terms of Use, available at <http://configio.com/terms-of-use/>. The Terms of Use contain important provisions, including provisions disclaiming, limiting, or excluding the liability of Configio for your use of the Website and provisions determining the applicable law and exclusive jurisdiction for the resolution of any disputes regarding your use of the Website. Each of those provisions applies to any disputes that may arise in relation to this Privacy Policy and the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information and are of the same force and effect as if they had been reproduced directly in this Privacy Policy.

##### **What Steps Are Taken To Keep Personal Information Secure?**

Configio exercises commercially reasonable care in providing for transmission of your information from your computer to its servers and with respect to storage of that information. While Configio has mechanisms in place to safeguard your personal information once it receives it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
