[Home](https://web.archive.org/default.asp) > [Privacy Statement](https://web.archive.org/privacy/)

Your privacy is important to Future Information Research Management - FIRM. This statement discloses the information practices for FIRM Web sites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. 

**Two main categories of FIRM sites**   
FIRM runs two main categories of Internet sites:

For the first category, FIRM acts as an Application Service Provider for companies conducting data collection activities via the Internet, primarily Market Research activities. You may be submitted a web surveys to fill in, and the template of the survey may state "Powered by Confirmit". Web surveys launched by FIRM Customers may be hosted on FIRM's ASP Hosting Site (survey.confirmit.com and author.confirmit.com), or on the customer's own hosting site (other www addresses). In any of these cases, please be aware that it is the FIRM Customer performing the data collection that has the full responsibility for usage of that data. In such cases, please refer to the privacy policy of the FIRM customer who sent you the web survey. 

The second category is related to information offered by FIRM to customers, prospects and other visitors (the FIRM website, the Confirmit Extranet, etc). The remaining of this statement is related to this set of sites. 

**Personal information**   
In general, you can visit FIRM on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when FIRM or our partners may need information from you.

You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address or e-mail id, to correspond with you, to process a request, or to provide you with a subscription. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have his or her permission to do so. 

**Using and Sharing Personal Information**   
The following paragraphs describe in more detail how FIRM may use your personal information and with whom we may share it. Depending on the specific FIRM Web site you are visiting, one or more of the following may apply. 

**Fulfilling your transaction request**   
If you request something from an FIRM Web site, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information, with others, for instance, other parts of FIRM and FIRM's Business Partners involved in the fulfillment. In connection with a transaction we may also contact you for market research purposes. 

**Marketing Use  
**The information you provide to FIRM on certain FIRM Web sites may also be used by FIRM and FIRM's Business Partners for marketing purposes. Before we use it, however, we will offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used in this way.  

**FIRM Career Web Sites (including Recruitment)**  
In connection with a job application or inquiry, whether advertised on an FIRM Web site or otherwise, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume or curriculum vitae. We may use this information throughout FIRM and its related entities for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry. Except where you tell us not to, we will keep the information for future consideration. 

**Surveys**  
From time-to-time FIRM invites customers, web site visitors and others to complete web surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to respond and whether or not to disclose any requested information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys, they may not use respondents' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Information for FIRM Business Partners**  
If you represent a FIRM Business Partner, you may visit an FIRM Web site intended specifically for FIRM Business Partners. We may use information provided on that site to administer and develop our business relationship with you, the Business Partner you represent, and FIRM Business Partners generally. 

**Information for FIRM Customers**  
If you represent a FIRM Customer, you may visit a FIRM Web site intended specifically for FIRM Customers. We may use information provided on that site to administer and develop our business relationship with you, the Customer you represent, and FIRM Customers generally.  

**Other FIRM Web Site Notices**  
In some cases, specific FIRM Web sites may contain other notices about their use and the information practices applicable to those sites. 

**Our Worldwide Practices**  
FIRM is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders. 

Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information, all over the world.

We may share your personal information within FIRM and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business.

Some countries may provide less legal protection for your information. In such countries FIRM will still handle information in the manner we describe here. 

**Cookies**  
We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on FIRM Web sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." FIRM or other organizations on FIRM's behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service. 

Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies. 

We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some FIRM pages use cookies, sent by FIRM or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Web site. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work properly.

**Service Quality Monitoring**  
Certain Web transactions may also involve you calling us or our calling you. Please be aware that it is FIRM's general practice to monitor and in some cases record such calls for staff training or quality assurance purposes.

**Personalized URL Link**  
On occasion, we may personalize and customize Web sites for certain visitors. If you visit one of these sites, you may find it customized with references to products and/or services that we believe may be of interest to you, based on your previous interactions with FIRM and information you have provided to us. While you are visiting these Web sites, we may collect information about your visit to better tailor the site to your interests. An invitation to visit one of these Web sites is usually presented as a personalized URL in an e-mail, a notice on a Web site registration page, or as a response to you logging on to a certain Web site.

If you choose to visit one of these Web sites, you are agreeing to let FIRM collect information about your visits and also to its association with other information about you and your relationship with FIRM. If you do not wish your information to be used in this way, do not accept the invitation to visit these sites.

**Disclosures Required By Law**  
Please be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.

**Links to non-FIRM Web sites**  
FIRM Web sites may contain links to other Web sites. FIRM is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other Web sites.
