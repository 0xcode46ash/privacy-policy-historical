## PHISHING Emails That Reference Confirmit

We have been informed that e-mails with the subject “Important Information Regarding Your XXXX Account” are being sent by parties not affiliated with Confirmit.

These emails ask recipients to provide login information related to an account that might be held at the company referenced in the subject line. The emails point to this webpage, Confirmit’s Privacy Policy, for more information.

Confirmit is not responsible for the content of these emails. If you believe that you have been asked to provide personal information, please approach the company with whom you hold the account for more information and instructions. Confirmit does not engage in such practices.

Note that Confirmit, as a provider of online survey software, enables its customers to send emails to individuals asking them to participate in market research surveys, or to provide customer and employee feedback. Confirmit does not authorize, approve or in any other way bear responsibility for emails sent out by clients under the terms of their contract to license Confirmit.

## WHAT is Confirmit?

CONFIRMIT is a feedback management software platform that enables businesses to gather feedback from customers and employees, and take action to improve business processes. With CONFIRMIT, clients create their own surveys or feedback solutions, and send them to customers, employees, or other third parties. We are an Software as a Service (SaaS) provider. As such, our clients, using our software, collect information from end users via our proprietary software packages. We may also collect information from users of CONFIRMIT’s website at <http://www.confirmit.com/home.aspx>  (“CONFIRMIT’s Website”). Our methods for collection and use of information depend on whether the user is using CONFIRMIT’s Website (a “CONFIRMIT User”) or accessing our service on one of our SaaS sites (an “SaaS User”).

## Two main categories of Confirmit sites

Confirmit runs two main categories of Internet sites:

  1. For the first category, Confirmit acts as a SaaS provider for companies conducting data collection and reporting activities via the Internet. You may be submitted a web surveys to fill in, and the template of the survey may state "Powered by Confirmit". Web surveys launched by Confirmit Customers may be hosted on Confirmit's SaaS environment (survey.confirmit.com and author.confirmit.com), or alternatively they may be hosted on our customer's own hosting environment (other www-addresses). In any of these cases, please be aware that it is our customers who are performing the data collection that have the responsibility for who they collect data from, what e-mail invitation they send out, and how they use the collected data. Confirmit is acting solely as a data processor (as defined in the EU Data Protection Directive), whereas our customer is the data controller. In such cases, please refer to the privacy policy of the Confirmit customer who sent you the web survey.



**_NOTE: For information about cookies when you use our SaaS environment, please refer to our Cookie Policy http://www.confirmit.com/legals/cookie-policy.aspx._** We do not use cookies in surveys you are invited to take via an e-mail invitation with a clickable link, or via pop-ups, but the party delivering the survey to you may. 

  1. The second category of sites we manage, is related to information offered by Confirmit to customers, prospects and other visitors (the Confirmit website, the Confirmit Extranet, etc).

**_The remaining of this policy is related to this latter type of sites._**




## Personal information

In general, you can visit Confirmit on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when Confirmit or our partners may need information from you.

You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address or e-mail id, to correspond with you, to process a request, or to provide you with a subscription. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have his or her permission to do so.

## Using and Sharing Personal Information

The following paragraphs describe in more detail how Confirmit may use your personal information and with whom we may share it. Depending on the specific Confirmit Web site you are visiting, one or more of the following may apply.

## Fulfilling your transaction request

If you request something from an Confirmit Web site, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information, with others, for instance, other parts of Confirmit and Confirmit's Business Partners involved in the fulfillment. In connection with a transaction we may also contact you for market research purposes.

## Marketing Use

The information you provide to Confirmit on certain Confirmit Web sites may also be used by Confirmit and Confirmit's Business Partners for marketing purposes. Before we use it, however, we will offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used in this way.

## Confirmit Career Web Sites (including Recruitment)

In connection with a job application or inquiry, whether advertised on an Confirmit Web site or otherwise, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume or curriculum vitae. We may use this information throughout Confirmit and its related entities for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry. Except where you tell us not to, we will keep the information for future consideration.

## Surveys

From time-to-time Confirmit invites customers, web site visitors and others to complete web surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to respond and whether or not to disclose any requested information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys, they may not use respondents' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

## Information for Confirmit Business Partners

If you represent a Confirmit Business Partner, you may visit an Confirmit Web site intended specifically for Confirmit Business Partners. We may use information provided on that site to administer and develop our business relationship with you, the Business Partner you represent, and Confirmit Business Partners generally.

## Information for Confirmit Customers

If you represent a Confirmit Customer, you may visit a Confirmit Web site intended specifically for Confirmit Customers. We may use information provided on that site to administer and develop our business relationship with you, the Customer you represent, and Confirmit Customers generally.

## Other Confirmit Web Site Notices

## Our Worldwide Practices

Confirmit is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders.

Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information, all over the world.

We may share your personal information within Confirmit and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business. Some countries may provide less legal protection for your information. In such countries Confirmit will still handle information in the manner we describe here.

## Cookies

We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on Confirmit Web sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." Confirmit or other organizations on Confirmit's behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.

Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies.

We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some Confirmit pages use cookies, sent by Confirmit or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Web site.

**NOTE** : You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work properly.
