## ANTI-SPAM COMMITMENT

Association of Equipment Manufacturers (“AEM”) is committed to providing transparency to outside parties with respect to the compliance of the organization’s electronic communication with Canada’ Anti-Spam Legislation, in effect as of July 1, 2014, and its relevant rules and regulations (hereinafter “CASL”). To that end, the AEM Anti-Spam Commitment is a formal statement of rights and obligations which is made available to outside parties. It is intended to inform outside parties of the type of responsible and transparent practices adopted by AEM when electronically communicating with outside parties, to inform outside parties about who they may contact at AEM for any concern pertaining to electronic communications, and to inform such outside parties of where and how they may unsubscribe to any electronic communications from AEM. This document also includes a series of answers to questions about spam and AEM’s practices that are frequently asked by outside parties that AEM may communicate with.

This Anti-Spam Commitment generally applies to any electronic communications sent by AEM to outside parties and is protected by a range of business procedures, processes and policies to ensure that such communications are done in compliance with CASL. AEM, in its electronic communications with outside parties, has to comply with the rules established by CASL and enforced by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the Competition Bureau and the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. CASL regulates all commercial electronic messages (“CEM”), which are messages that include among their purposes, the encouragement of participation in a commercial activity.

AEM has undertaken various initiatives in order to make sure that it is compliant with CASL. It has adopted this Anti-Spam Commitment ** ** to provide transparency to outside parties with respect to the compliance of the organization’s electronic communication practices with CASL, as well as undertaken the following initiatives:

The consent of outside parties is necessary in order for AEM to send a CEM. This consent typically must be “express”, but in certain circumstances consent can be “implied” and in others, messages are specifically exempt from consent requirements. AEM has modified certain consent forms in order to ensure that the express consent obtained from recipients is in compliance with CASL. In addition, our business contacts can determine and manage their communication preferences by going to the Subscription Center from any CEM.

Your communication preferences can be updated at any time by visiting the Subscription Center, which can be accessed at any time via any CEM. You can have your email address removed from our mailing lists at any time, although even if you unsubscribe to receiving CEM from AEM, you may still receive electronic messages from AEM which relate to an ongoing business relationship or which are exempt under CASL.

AEM has modified its email footers to manage CASL’s consent requirements. ** ** Under CASL, all CEM sent must include certain prescribed content. For example, AEM must clearly identify AEM as the party sending the CEM, provide a method whereby the recipient can readily contact AEM, such as a mailing address and one of (i) a telephone number with active response voicemail, (ii) an email address, or (iii) a web address; and provide a working unsubscribe mechanism. In consequence, CASL compliant email footers have been updated in all CEMsent from AEM, in order to ensure compliance with CASL.

AEM has incorporated unsubscribe mechanisms into all CEM in order to manage CASL’s consent requirements. ** ** Under CASL, each CEM must provide a working unsubscribe mechanism (functional for 60 days), which must be processed without delay, within a maximum of 10 business days. ** ** In consequence, AEM has set up a uniform process in order to ensure that all unsubscribe requests will be complied with. You may at any time unsubscribe from receiving CEM from AEM by following the process laid out in the electronic message you receive, or contact Tara Ratzlaff, Anti-Spam Compliance Officer, at [tratzlaff@aem.org](mailto:tratzlaff@aem.org) or (414) 298-4742, although even if you unsubscribe to receiving CEM from AEM, you may still receive electronic messages from AEM which relate to an ongoing business relationship or which are exempt under CASL.

The types of CEM AEM may send from time to time could include the following:

**If you have received a CEM from AEM and you believe that you should not have, please assess as to whether you have provided implied or express consent to receive CEMs from AEM, or if an exemption applies.**

**_When is an electronic message exempt under CASL?_**  
If you are receiving an electronic communications from AEM, it may be a message that is  ** _exempt_**  under CASL. This would be the case if the message is one the following:

In certain situations, your consent is not required for certain types of messages sent by AEM, although you may still unsubscribe from future transmission of similar messages. The type of messages where AEM does not need your consent is an electronic message that:

**If you have received a CEM, and you believe that you should not have, please contact us immediately at tratzlaff@aem.org**   **and we will promptly remove your address from our list (within 10 business days).**

You may be contacted by a AEM employee via social media, such as LinkedIn, if you are connected on the social network with the AEM employee, or if you have indicated through your preference settings the fact that you are open to receiving messages about new business opportunities or ventures. You may also be contacted if you have conspicuously published your electronic address (for instance, on a social media website), have not indicated that you did not wish to receive CEM, and the CEM sent is in connection with your business role and function.

At AEM, we take the respect of laws very seriously. You may unsubscribe at any time from receiving CEM, by visiting our Subscription Center from any CEM or emailing [remove@aem.org](mailto:remove@aem.org), and we will remove you from our list within ten (10) business days.

From time to time, AEM will review and update this Anti-Spam Commitment as required to keep current with rules and regulations, new technologies, standards, our business practices and outside parties’ concerns. We will post any Anti-Spam Commitment changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, as the case may be, email notification of Anti-Spam Commitment changes).

AEM has designated its CASL Compliance Officer as the person accountable for compliance with this Anti-Spam Commitment:
