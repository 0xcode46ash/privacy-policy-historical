## Privacy Policy

### ConnectAndSell Privacy Policy

ConnectAndSell respects the privacy of every individual who visits this web site, located at www.connectandsell.com. This Privacy Policy outlines the information that ConnectAndSell may collect from users of the Site and how we may use that information. Except as otherwise discussed in this Policy, this document only addresses the collection, use, and disclosure of information that we collect from you on this site. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how this information can be accessed and updated.  This policy refers to users of the site only, not clients of our service.  Clients of our Software as a Service solution should refer to our End User License Agreement. 

### User Data

ConnectAndSell collects different types of information from users of the Site. We collect “Personal Information,” which, generally speaking, is information that identifies you individually, such as your name, email, company, telephone number and title. We will only collect Personal Information about you that you provide to us voluntarily. If you do not want your Personal Information collected, please do not submit it to us. When you do provide us with Personal Information, we may store and evaluate that information to better understand your needs and how we can better serve you, and we may use that information to improve our service and to contact you. ConnectAndSell also collects Non-Personal Information from users of the Site. “Non-Personal Information” is information that does not itself identify you personally, such as the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the website from which you linked to the Site. We may automatically (i.e., not via registration) collect Non-Personal Information when you connect to or use the Site. We may store, compile, publish, promote, report, lease, sell, or otherwise disclose Non-Personal Information to third parties, provided that the information does not personally identify you. 

### Security

ConnectAndSell encrypts all Personal Information collected about you and stores that information in its data center protected by industry standard firewalls. However, please understand that absolute security does not exist on the Internet. 

### Company Sale

Personal and Non-Personal Information collected through the Site is considered a trade secret of ConnectAndSell. As the owner of such information, we may disclose or sell such information as an asset of the company in conjunction with the sale to a third party of our company or a portion of our assets. 

### Third Party Sites

The Site may contain links, including advertisements, to web sites operated by third parties (“Third Party Sites”). Because ConnectAndSell has no control over Third Party Sites, ConnectAndSell does not endorse, has not reviewed, and is not responsible for information collected about you by Third Party Sites. Your use of Third Party Sites is solely at your own risk. 

### Acceptance of Terms

By using the Site you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please exit the Site immediately. 

### Notification of Changes

ConnectAndSell may change the terms of this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please check this Privacy Policy each time you visit the Site so that you are aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to the terms of this Privacy Policy will constitute acceptance to the amended policy. 

### Opt-out Procedures

ConnectAndSell provides users of the Site with an easy way to stop receiving email offers. To remove your Personal Information from our database or to not receive future email communications, simply reply to an email offer or send an email to info@connectandsell.com with the word “Remove” in the subject line. 

### Questions

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy please contact ConnectAndSell’s customer service department at info@connectandsell.com.
