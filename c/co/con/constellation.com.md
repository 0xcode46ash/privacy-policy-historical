# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to your use of this Web site of Constellation Energy Group, Inc. or one of its affiliates (“us” or “we”). We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices. Using this Web site indicates that you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, so please read it carefully before any use. If you do not accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, then do not use this Web site.

## Information Collection and Use

We do not collect information that personally identifies you (i.e., information about you such as your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily or you use one of our vendor applications such as online payment and account management programs. We use data provided by users to tailor and deliver services to suit the particular needs of our clients. We may use demographic and profile information to tailor a user’s experience at our site, showing them the content that we think they might be interested in as well as displaying the content according to the user’s preferences.

This Web site may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you which is made available by your browser, computer hardware and/or software, including but not limited to your IP address, browser type, operating system, domain name, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used to operate the service, to maintain and improve quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of our Web sites.

We may use your IP address to help administer our Web site. IP addresses are logged to track a user’s session. This tells us the region our site visitors come from and indicates which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information. This means that a user’s session will be tracked, but the user’s identity will be anonymous to us.

Our site may also use order forms to enable site visitors to request information, products and services. We collect visitors’ contact information, such as their e-mail addresses, from the order form to send information about us to them. We may administer online surveys to gather information about your views and/or usage of our products and services, the usefulness of our Web site or other related matters. Your participation in our online surveys is voluntary. If you choose to participate, the information you provide will be used to improve our Web site, products and services.

## Children’s Privacy

We comply with the Child Online Protection Act of 1998. We do not wish to collect or disseminate personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we become aware that a user under the age of 13 has submitted information or is attempting to submit information, we will notify the user that he or she is not eligible to submit information to us, and we will expunge any personally identifiable information from our records.

## Cookies and Tracking Information

“Cookies” are small text files placed in your computer’s browser that store certain preferences and information, which may enhance your web browsing experience. This site may use cookies for any of a variety of reasons, including but not limited to improving quality, enhancing our understanding of how users interact with us, and for session management purposes. If for some reason you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible by cookies, most web browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies to accept. However, certain features of the Web site may not work as intended or may be slowed if you decline to accept cookies.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

Except as provided in this Policy, we do not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about our users to anyone outside of our corporate family without first receiving that user’s permission. In addition, Baltimore Gas and Electric Company will not share confidential customer information with other Constellation Energy companies except to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulation. We may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including but not limited to packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and we will tell them that they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with law or legal process served on us, (b) protect and defend our rights or property, or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of us, our employees, users of our products or services, or members of the public.

We may share certain aggregated information with others, such as the number of users performing searches and how many visits were made to a particular Web page.

## Third Party Sites

This site may contain links to third party sites not owned or operated by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites operated by third parties. Once you have left our Web site, we suggest you check the applicable privacy policy of the third party Web site to determine how they will handle any information they collect from you.

## Information Protection and Security

We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees and personnel who need to know such information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. Any such personal information is transferred to our servers. Electronic safeguards include technology such as firewalls and Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) to protect and encrypt certain sensitive transmissions of information. However, you should keep in mind that this Web site is run on software, hardware, and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance, experience problems or breaches of security. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any username and/or password and are responsible for any unauthorized use.
