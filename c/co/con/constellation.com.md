This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to your use of this Web site of Constellation Energy Group, Inc. or one of its affiliates (“us” or “we”). We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices. Using this Web site indicates that you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, so please read it carefully before any use. If you do not accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, then do not use this Web site. We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time at our sole discretion and without notice to you.

**Information Collection and Use**  
We do not collect personally identifiable information about you (i.e., personally identifiable information about you such as your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily or you use one of our vendor applications such as online payment and account management programs. We use data provided by users to tailor and deliver services to suit the particular needs of our clients. We may use demographic and profile information to tailor a user’s experience at our site, showing them the content that we think they might be interested in as well as displaying the content according to the user’s preferences.

This Web site may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you which is made available by your browser, computer hardware and/or software, including but not limited to your IP address, browser type, operating system, domain name, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used to operate the service, to maintain and improve quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of our Web sites.

We may use your IP address to help administer our Web site. IP addresses are logged to track a user’s session. This tells us the region our site visitors come from and gives us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user’s session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.

Our site may also use order forms for site visitors to request information, products and services. We collect visitors’ contact information, like their e-mail addresses. Contact information from the order form is used to send information about us to our site visitors.

**Children’s Privacy**  
We comply with the Child Online Protection Act of 1998. We do not wish to collect or disseminate personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we become aware that a user under the age of 13 has submitted information or is attempting to submit information, we will notify the user that he or she is not eligible to submit information to us, and we will expunge any personally identifiable information from our records.

**Cookies and Tracking Information**  
This site may use cookies for any of a variety of reasons, including but not limited to improving quality, better understanding how users interact with us, for session management purposes. If for some reason you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies to accept.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
We do not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about our users to anyone outside of our corporate family without first receiving that user’s permission, preventing this information from appearing in unauthorized mailings and other solicitations. In addition, Baltimore Gas and Electric Company will not share confidential customer information with other Constellation Energy companies except to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulation. We may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including but not limited to packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and we will tell them that they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with law or legal process served on us, (b) protect and defend our rights or property, or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of us, our employees, users of our products or services, or members of the public.

We may share certain aggregated information with others, such as the number of users performing searches and how many visits were made to a particular Web page.

**Third Party Sites**  
This site may contain links to third party sites not owned or operated by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites operated by third parties. Once you have left our Web site, we suggest you check the applicable privacy policy of the third party Web site to determine how they will handle any information they collect from you.

**Information Protection and Security**  
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees and personnel who need to know such information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. Any such personal information is transferred to our servers.

**Deleting or Changing Your Information**
