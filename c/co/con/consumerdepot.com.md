Security: To guard against credit card fraud, we offer secure online ordering using the latest Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. The connection between your browser and our servers is encrypted with industry-standard SSL technology, which scrambles ordering information so that only your browser and our servers can decipher it. To use this option you must have a browser that supports SSL, such as later versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Communicator. If you are unable to establish a secure connection, please call us at (615) 851-2125 to place your order by phone. Privacy Policy:
