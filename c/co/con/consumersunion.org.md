**Consumers Union Privacy Policy**

Consumers Union does not sell or rent any information provided by you via this web site with any unaffiliated third party. Our affiliates are the Consumers Union Foundation and the Consumers Union Action Fund. No such information is shared with any unaffiliated third party except in limited circumstances to provide products and service to you or in response to a request from law enforcement ( _see here for more details_).

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT**

Much of the information on our site can be accessed without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you. You can surf ConsumerUnion.org and related advocacy sites and view much of our content anonymously. For instance, you can access information on policy issues affecting consumers without giving out any personally identifiable information.

The information we gather on our site falls into two categories: (1) personal information you supply when you "take action" on a policy issue or register to receive email updates, etc., and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our site.

**Personally identifiable information**

To use certain features on our site, we ask you to subscribe or register. When you do this, we will collect personally identifiable information about you such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone number. In addition, we may ask you for the same type of information when you transmit letters to decision-makers or corporations on a policy issue, or complete a survey. We use this information to complete the transaction you requested, to provide you information relevant to your interests or to help improve our site. 

**Aggregate information**

When you use our site, we may collect tracking information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, and pages visited on the site. None of this information identifies you personally; we collect it for aggregate reporting on site activity. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on our site, or which pages or features get the most attention. We use this information to make the site more useful to you. 

We use "cookies" to store and sometimes to track user information. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, taking action on one of our advocacy campaigns and agreeing to be part of our advocacy network or subscribing to our site. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie contains a unique number that allows our site to recognize your computer. For example, cookies allow us to keep track of your user name and password (if you are a subscriber) so you don't have to re-enter that information each time you visit our site. The "help" function on most browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies, you won't be able to take advantage of various features on our site that are available to other visitors

**HOW YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE USED**

ConsumerUnion.org and related advocacy web sites use personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways. We use the information to provide you with news and action alerts based on the interests you have expressed by taking action on an advocacy campaign through our web site or through an online form that you have filled out. We also use the information you provide to send you e-mail on Consumers Union advocacy issues, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.

**Sharing your personally identifiable information**

In some instances, we use third party companies to help us provide our products and services to you, like an e-mail delivery service that sends out our e-mails and e-newsletters. In those instances we need to share your information with them. We require that those companies use the information only to deliver the product or service. 

We may occasionally release personal information as required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena. 

**HOW YOU CAN CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION**

Consumers Union believes in providing you with the ability to access and edit the personal information that you have provided to us. [To update your information you have provided if you took action on one of our advocacy campaigns through our web site, follow the links at the bottom of our newsletter ConsumerLine, or access your profile and update your contact information and user preferences by following the instructions at http://cu.convio.net/site/UserLogin.](http://cu.convio.net/site/UserLogin)

**OUR E-MAIL POLICIES**

Account and services related e-mail: If you have taken action on a policy issue, we will send you e-mails relating to your account. For example, these include confirmations that the email you sent through our web site has been delivered.

E-mail newsletters and action alerts: You may request updates or news about Consumers Union's activities, which will be sent to the email account you identified. To unsubscribe, follow the instructions included in every email we send you. If you have taken an action on a policy issue, we may send you e-mail about other policy issues that may be of interest to you. You can choose not to receive additional types of messages in the future by following the 'unsubscribe' instructions located near the bottom of each e-mail.

HTML verification: When receiving an e-mail from CU, we may place a one-pixel gif in that e-mail to understand whether or not you can accept HTML images and, if you can accept HTML, whether or not you viewed the e-mail. This process does not leave any information on your computer, nor does it collect information from your computer. Consumers Union does not share or sell this information with others, and we only use it to improve our e-mail communications with you.

**DONATIONS**  
If you make a tax-deductible donation to Consumer Reports or Consumers Union, your name or any information from that donation will not be sold or exchanged with any other company or organization. No additional emails will be sent to you based on this donation. You will be contacted by mail to subscribe to our publications, books or other services which includes future donations. If you do not wish to receive mail solicitations from us, please write:

**SECURITY**

We work to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect through all channels. 

**Security Of The Personal Information You Provide**

**Credit card information**. Your donation will be processed through the Consumer Reports donation system. We use data encryption technology to help protect against loss, misuse or alteration of your sensitive credit or debit card information. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which creates an encrypted connection for the transmission of any credit or debit card information you input online and we use the same encryption protection for any payment authorizations for transactions we request through any channel. Once we collect your credit card or debit card information, it is stored on restricted-access computers that are not directly accessible via the Internet. 

**Personal Information**. We protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information by using industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls, coupled with security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration. 

Please keep in mind that any information you include in a message you post online to any discussion group, or other public posting area on our sites is available to anyone with Internet access. If you don't want people to know your name or email address, for example, do not include them in any message you post publicly.

**Information use by our employees and agents**. Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information. Using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, our policies restrict access to personal information only to those employees who need to access it for business purposes. 

**Security Enforcement**

Any unauthorized access to any Consumer Reports or Consumers Union web sites or to the information collected and maintained by us should be immediately brought to our attention by contacting us via email at [**cuwebsite@consumersunion.org**](mailto:cuwebsite@consumersunion.org) or by writing to us at Consumers Union Customer Relations, Attn: Security, 101 Truman Avenue, Yonkers, NY 10703. We will investigate, and, if necessary, take action to halt any violation of the security of your personal information of which we become aware.

In the unlikely event that we believe the security of your sensitive personal information, such as payment card information, in our possession or control may have been compromised, we will apply the same notification policy to all of those individuals affected. We will endeavor to provide required notice as soon as possible under the circumstances and will ensure that in addition to any other methods, notices are posted on our ConsumerReports.org and (if applicable) our Consumers Union web sites.

**Security Of Access To Your Online Account Information**

If you sign up to receive Consumers Union Advocacy email, we maintain the information you provide to us (Name, email address, physical address and sometimes phone number) in a secure database. In order to change that information, [**click here**](http://www.consumersunion.org/updateprofile.htm), and you will be instructed how to access your username and then receive your password by email. Then you may log on to your profile, enter your username and password and make any changes to your account information. If you want to change your password or other Advocacy account information, you may do so at any time and there is a link at the bottom of every email to help you. If you wish to change your email preferences (for example, you wish to get action alerts but not a monthly newsletter), [**click here**](http://www.consumersunion.org/updateprofile.htm). 

If you have forgotten your username, we will ask you for the e-mail address you used when you signed up for email (or an updated e-mail address that you have previously provided to us), and we will promptly e-mail your user name to that e-mail address. If you have forgotten your password, we will ask you for both your e-mail address and your user name.

It is your responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your user name and password and to control access to and use of your Advocacy account. We urge you to keep your user name and password confidential and not disclose them to anyone. We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision, for example, a third party’s unauthorized access to certain of your account information, such as your physical address.

**IMPORTANT** \- Although we take these steps to protect your personal information, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure, therefore we cannot promise or guarantee that such information will never be accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this policy.
