### **Information We Collect**

Your privacy is very important to us, and we have the highest respect for the confidentiality of your personal information. The information we receive depends on what you do while visiting our site. We will not obtain personally identifying information about you unless you choose to provide it. If you are browsing our site anonymously, we will automatically collect some non-identifying statistical information to help us measure which pages of our Web site are visited and how long visitors use the site. This information includes things such as your IP address, the time and date, pages entered and time spent on individual pages. Your IP address is not linked to anything personally identifiable.

While visiting our site, you are not required to submit any personal information to us. However, if you inquire about our services or request more information from us, we may collect contact information, such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number or information about your business, such as company name, company size and business type.

### **Information Use**

If you request information from us or wish to access certain features of the site, you will be asked to provide personally identifying information so that we can respond effectively to your requests and needs. We will never share your information with anyone who isn’t directly related to providing service and support of Contact At Once! online chat software solutions. If you provide us with personal information, we may attempt to contact you occasionally to determine if our solutions meet your expectations, offer additional assistance or notify you about special promotions.

### **Cookies and Other Technologies**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser and makes it easier for you to navigate our site. A persistent cookie allows us to monitor your interaction with our site and remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. We do/do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

– Web Beacons / Gifs

Our third-party web analytics partners employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.

The information gathered by clear gifs is not tied to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

– Flash LSOs

We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control or other video player settings. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, click here:
