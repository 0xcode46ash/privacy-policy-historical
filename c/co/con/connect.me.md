# Privacy Policy | Respect Network

### Respect Network practices what we preach: our privacy policy is the [Respect Trust Framework](https://web.archive.org/the-respect-trust-framework/ "The Respect Trust Framework").

* * *

The Respect Network™ is provided by Respect Network Corporation ( _“Respect Network”_ ), and is accessible from the Respect Network website at https://www.respectnetwork.com/. Our legal address is:

Respect Network Corporation  
3145 Geary Blvd #419, San Francisco, CA, 94118 USA

This privacy policy incorporates by reference the Respect Trust Framework listed with the Open Identity Exchange at <http://openidentityexchange.org/trust-frameworks/respect-trust-framework>. The purpose of the Respect Trust Framework is to define a simple set of principles and rules to which all Members of a digital trust network agree so that they may share identity and personal data with greater confidence that it will be protected and only used as authorized. Respect Network and all Members of the Respect Network agree to operate under the Respect Trust Framework. A summary of the five Respect Principles (Promise, Permission, Protection, Portability, Proof) at the heart of the Respect Trust Framework is available at [https://www.respectnetwork.com/respect-trust-framework](https://web.archive.org/the-respect-trust-framework/ "The Respect Trust Framework").

Our privacy policy is simple: Respect Network does not collect or share personal information. Our purpose is to provide a personal cloud network where all Members enjoy the protections of the Respect Trust Framework. If you share any personal information with us in the context of using our website or the accessing our services, such as sharing your name or email address by contacting us via email, we promise to protect that personal information and only use it as you have explicitly authorized us, for example to respond to your contact request.

Our services are not directed to people under 13. If it comes to your attention that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at [privacy@respectnetwork.com](mailto:privacy@respectnetwork.com).

While we may revise this privacy policy, it must remain compliant with the terms of the Respect Trust Framework, which may only be changed with a vote of the Trust Anchors of the Respect Network as described in the Versioning and Amendments section of that document. See <http://openidentityexchange.org/trust-frameworks/respect-trust-framework>.

If you have any comments or questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at [privacy@respectnetwork.com](mailto:privacy@respectnetwork.com).
