# CONSERVATIVE PARTY OF CANADA - Privacy Policy

_**Our Commitment to Protecting Your Privacy**_

Your privacy is important to us. The Conservative Party will respect your privacy through the protection of any of your personal information that you provide to us. We take great care to keep both confidential and secure all personal information in our possession. 

_**What is "Personal Information"**_

"Personal Information" is information about an identifiable individual. It may include information such name, address, telephone number and other contact information. 

_**How Your Personal Information may Reach Us**_

The Conservative Party does not actively seek to collect the personal information of Canadians. Nor does it collect any personal information about you without your permission. 

We do obtain personal information when you join or make a contribution to the Conservative Party. As well, when you visit our web site, you may wish to provide us with information that permits us to keep you informed about Conservative Party policies and activities or which enables you to become a volunteer or make a financial contribution. 

Personal information is also collected as part of the registration process for Conservative Party conventions and other events. 

Our collection of personal information is limited to what is necessary and reasonable. 

_**How we use your Personal Information  
**_

Your information is used to communicate with you, or to facilitate your participation as a volunteer if you wish to assist. We take great care in the way we store and use your personal information. 

Because the Conservative Party is a national organization with a riding-based membership system, your personal information may also be used by our local riding associations including by contestants for nominations. For example, if you have made a financial contribution, the local riding may contact you to see if you would like to continue your support. 

As a federal political party registered under the Canada Elections Act, the Conservative Party including its “electoral district associations�? (riding associations) are subject to extensive regulation under that Act, including in particular public disclosure requirements for contributions over $200. 

We will not sell your personal information that you have chosen to provide us, nor will we disclose it to third parties except as required by the Elections Act. 

_**How we Protect Your Personal Information  
**_

We maintain security systems to safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure or misuse, and from loss or unauthorized alteration. 

_**Accuracy of Personal Information**_

We will strive to ensure that the personal information we have on file for you is accurate and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. If any information needs to be updated or amended, we will make every effort to change our records, and will inform those of our offices having access to the information in question. 

You may update or correct the personal information you provide to us by e-mailing us at web@conservative.ca.
