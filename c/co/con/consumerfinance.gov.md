# Privacy Policy > Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

## Privacy Policy

This website is intended to be a trusted source of information for the American public. In order to provide you with a great experience and to deliver information as effectively as possible, this site collects some information about visitors. We take protecting your personal privacy on the web extremely seriously. This page describes ConsumerFinance.gov’s policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of that information. During this interim period when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is being built, we are relying on the Department of the Treasury’s [privacy policy](http://www.treasury.gov/SitePolicies/Pages/privacy.aspx) and process.

### Information Collected Automatically

If you visit ConsumerFinance.gov to read or download information, we collect and store only the following information about you:

  * The name of the domain from which you access the site (more commonly called your [IP address](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address));
  * The date and time at which you access the site; and
  * The address from which you linked directly to our site, if you arrived here by clicking a link on another website.



### Personally Identifying Information

We will not obtain personally identifying information about you when you visit our site unless you voluntarily provide it. Information you might provide voluntarily includes your e-mail address, when you sign up for e-mail updates (when you sign up for e-mail updates), or any other personal information you include when sending us comments. 

### Sharing Information

We may share information you give us with contractors acting on our behalf or with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency. In other limited circumstances, such as responses to requests from Congress and private individuals, we may be required by law to disclose information you submit. If you provide comments in response to a request for public comments, we may make your comments, as well as your identity, available to the public either in a publication or by posting that information on our website. We may give you more specific guidance at the point of collection regarding how your personal information may be used or disclosed.

### Legal Notices

For site management, information is collected for statistical purposes. Computer software programs are used to create summary statistics about visits to Treasury websites which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. In order to gather statistical information and to administer a customer satisfaction survey, the ConsumerFinance.gov website utilizes session cookies which are used only for the duration of a session. No information subject to the Privacy Act, such as your name or address, is collected or used for this analysis.

No other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits except in connection with authorized law enforcement investigations.

For information specific to any Treasury bureau website regarding the use of cookies and other privacy information, please review the privacy policy at that bureau’s website.

Generally, individuals are strongly discouraged from sending any personal information, like a Social Security number, to the Treasury Web master or any Treasury e-mail address. It may be necessary on certain bureau websites to collect personally identifiable information (name, e-mail address, Social Security number, or other unique identifier), but only if specifically and knowingly provided by you. Personally identifiable information you provide will be used only for such other purposes as are described at the point of collection by the bureau asking for the information. Visit the Privacy Policy pages of bureau websites for information on controls in place to ensure the security and confidentiality of any personally identifiable information collected by bureaus.

For more information on the Privacy Act, visit the Department of the Treasury’s [Privacy Act page](http://www.treasury.gov/FOIA/Pages/privacy_index.aspx). A discussion of rights under the Privacy Act is available at the [Federal Consumer Information Center](http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/fed_prog/foia/foia.htm).

### Site Analytics and Persistent Cookies

We use the web metrics service Google Analytics to track traffic to this site. This tool lets us understand how visitors are arriving at and engaging with all parts of our website. It provides basic metrics such as visitors, pageviews, and visits, as well as more complex metrics like the web browsers being used by visitors and how long, on average, they stay on the site.

This data does not include any personally identifiable information. Traffic statistics are only reported to us anonymously and in the aggregate, and no information provided by Google Analytics is traceable to any specific individual.

In order for Google Analytics to work, this site uses [“persistent cookie” technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie). ([Learn more about the cookies used by Google Analytics](http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/concepts/gaConceptsCookies.html).) A persistent cookie is a small text file that this website places on your computer so that it can remember you when you show up again later—kind of like cookie crumbs! Most Internet browsers automatically accept persistent cookies. Although we think using persistent cookies creates a much better experience for you, this site will also work without them. If you don’t want to accept cookies, you can edit your browser’s options to stop accepting persistent cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. [Here’s how to disable cookies.](http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml)
