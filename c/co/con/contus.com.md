In addition, Contus owns several other domain names that point to the web sites listed above, and we will, from time to time, add new sites that may, or may not be, listed above. Please note that this policy applies only to sites maintained by Contus or its subsidiaries, and not to web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link. This web site contains links to other web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are "clicking" to another web site. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their privacy policy may differ from ours. Furthermore, from time to time, Contus may employ third parties who may collect personal information on behalf of Contus. In such cases, such third parties will be instructed by Contus to comply with the Contus Privacy Policy as set forth herein.

**What information is collected?**  
Contus only collects personal information from our online visitors on a voluntary basis. Personal information collected from our "Get a Quote" form may include your name, e-mail address, phone number, home address and information that will be helpful to our agents in providing you with the service you are requesting from us. The "Contact Us" form allows the customer a quicker means of communication with our agents. Customers will be contacted by one of our agents in agreement with the customers' request via email or telephone. Log files are also collected such as IP addresses, ISP and browser type. Log files are collected for internal marketing purposes and are not linked to a user's personal information.

**What about cookies?**  
Currently we do not use cookies in our site.

**What happens to the information provided?**  
When you register on a Contus online site, you will be asked to provide personally identifying information. The information you provide will allow us to alert you to special offers, upgrade travel opportunities, time sensitive information, contests and events of interest. This will be sent via email. Users may opt-out of receiving these communications; see the opt-out section below. None of the information we collect is shared with outside parties. Finally, we may use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can consistently improve our sites to better meet our visitors' needs.

**Opt-out provision**  
When we first collect information about you, we will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of having any communication sent to you other than what is necessary for us to fulfill your travel requirements. (Except to the extent required by law, court order, or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority.) In addition, if you do not want Contus to send you e-mail or postal mail about our products and services, you can opt-out at the time of registration or information collection. If, at a later date, you choose to have your name removed from our database, you can do so by sending e-mail to [privacy_policy@contus.com](mailto:privacy_policy@contus.com) or by calling (419) 868-6090 or by sending a fax to (419) 868-6099.

**Safeguarding your personally identifiable information**  
We will only collect personally identifiable information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and we will maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of that personal information.

**Review, correction and deletion of information from files**  
If for any reason you are concerned that the personal information maintained by Contus is not correct, or should you wish to have your name removed from our records, please contact us at [privacy_policy@contus.com](mailto:privacy_policy@contus.com) or call (419) 868-6090 or send a fax to (419) 868-6099, and we will be happy to review, update or remove information as appropriate. You may also contact your Contus agent.

Changes will be posted to the site. Please check back from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes in our privacy practices.
