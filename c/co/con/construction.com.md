# Privacy Policy

When you register on one of our web sites, your e-mail address is added to the electronic mailing list of the business unit you were visiting so that, from time to time, we can send you information or newsletters about news, new features, additions and changes to our web site. If you provided us with any additional information while you were ordering a product, we will use this information to help us fulfill your order. Occasionally, McGraw-Hill's Construction Information Group shares data collected about subscribers with other units within the family of The McGraw-Hill Companies and carefully screened companies outside The McGraw-Hill Companies, whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you. Many of our subscribers find these mail promotions valuable, whether they are shopping for merchandise, taking advantage of a special offer or purchasing unique services. 

Additionally, if you are a subscriber to the Dodge Digital Plans and Specs service, we may furnish your name and address to applicable project owners and architects so that they can monitor their intellectual property rights in the applicable plans and specifications. 

We use "cookies" only to help you navigate the site. We do not gather any information on you from any cookies, nor can we gather or change any information on your computer from our cookies. 

If you gave us your credit card number, it will be used one time only to fulfill one order. We do not keep or store credit card information. The exception is for subscribers of Dodge Plans, who have submitted credit card numbers for ongoing subscriptions. 

If you do not wish to have your name shared with companies outside The Mcgraw-Hill Companies, wish to review the accuracy of the information you've provided or have any questions about our privacy practices, please send us a note with your name, address and account number to: 

Amy Sidelinger,
