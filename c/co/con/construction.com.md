# McGraw-Hill Construction Privacy Notice

When you register on one of our web sites, your e-mail address is added to the electronic mailing list of the business unit you were visiting so that, from time to time, we can send you information or newsletters about news, new features, additions and changes to our web site. If you provided us with any additional information while you were ordering a product, we will use this information to help us fulfill your order. Occasionally, McGraw-Hill Construction shares data collected about subscribers with other units within the family of The McGraw-Hill Companies and carefully screened companies outside The McGraw-Hill Companies, whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you.

If you are a subscriber to the Dodge Digital Plans and Specs service, we may furnish your name and address to applicable project owners and architects so that they can monitor their intellectual property rights in the applicable plans and specifications.

If you download 3-Part specifications, Illustrations, Tables, CAD Library drawings or PDF catalogs from sweets.com, Network for products.com or products.construction.com, we will furnish your contact information provided during the registration process to the product manufacturer in order for the manufacturer to follow-up on your request.

If you gave us your credit card number, it will be used one time only to fulfill one order. We do not keep or store credit card information. The exception is for subscribers who have submitted credit card numbers for ongoing monthly subscriptions. 

This information will be maintained in a secure database in the United States and accessed only by authorized employees.
