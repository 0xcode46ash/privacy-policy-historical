**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

ConvertMedia collects information from our users at several different points on our Site. This may include traffic data including a user’s IP address, domain server, type of computer, and type of web browser. This is anonymous information that does not personally identify a user but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving a user’s experience on the Site. 

In general, when you visit our Site you remain anonymous. Some areas of our Site may however require login/registration. Personal information, such as a user’s name, address, contact information and other personally-identifiable information ( **“Personal Information”** ) may be collected from you and stored in our databases, typically when you register to the Site, request support, enter into a sales promotion or otherwise interact with us (for example through the “contact us” option). It should be made clear that you have no legal obligation to provide us with any Personal Information and the submission of such information is entirely subject to your sole discretion and consent. However if you will not provide us with the required information we may not be able to provide you with the information/services requested by you. Registered users may have a user name and password to access their information.

We may also collect statistical and other data related to your use of the Site or services thereon as well as information on Site usage patterns. This information is collected and used as non-individually identifiable information.

Any Personal Information voluntarily disclosed by you on our Site through e-mail, in public-view personal profiles, public-view uploaded materials, chat rooms, message boards, or intra-Site message systems, is viewed and possibly used by other users, and such disclosure may have unintended privacy implications for you.

**HOW WE USE INFORMATION**

We use information which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site and improve our services, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may use the information collected to market directly to that person subject to requirements of applicable law. This non personal information may be shared with third parties.

We compile and store data and information and generate reports related to our users’ access to and use of our Site and services.

We do not share, distribute, sell or rent any of your Personal Information with/to third parties, except in the following circumstances:

– If the information is required by law in order to prevent, investigate, or take action regarding illegal activities, situations involving potential threats to physical safety, rights, property or of any person, suspected fraud and violations of this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use. In addition, we will share information in response to legal process, court orders, subpoenas, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

– For the purpose of providing and operating the Site we may share non-PII information with trusted third-party partners who need to know for purpose of providing Site-related services to us only (and not for such third parties’ commercial use in any way). We will require that these third parties comply with this Privacy Policy and/or with privacy policies at least as protective as this Privacy Policy. 

– If we have your permission to do so.

Any data processing performed by these third parties will, if and when required by law, be governed by a data processing agreement in the form required by law, preserving your statutory data protection rights.

In the conduct of our business, we may sell certain of our assets. Information collected from users of the Site, including personal information, could be transferred as part of such transaction. By submitting your Personal Information through the Site, you agree that your information may be transferred to third parties under such or similar circumstances. 

**COOKIES**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our Site. We use cookies to enhance the user experience of our Site by means such as storing password or user preference information. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our Site with the only drawback being the disablement of some of the usability features of our Site. We may also use cookies to track and monitor usage of the Site by users for the purposes of marketing and Site improvement.

ConvertMedia uses the Evidon assurance platform to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the **Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)**. As part of this service, ConvertMedia’s online advertisements are sometimes delivered with icons that help consumers understand how their data is being used and provide choice options to consumers that want more control.

To opt-out from behavioral advertising in general, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

**TRACKING PIXELS**

We employ a software technology called tracking pixels that helps us better manage content on our web site as well as in order to show our users ads or promotions or marketing materials related to our users at a later stage. Tracking pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, tracking pixels are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. 

**E-MAIL COMMUNICATIONS**

At any time, you have the ability to opt out of receiving marketing communications from ConvertMedia, but you may not opt out of administrative emails (for example, emails about your transactions or policy changes) while you are a registered user. You can opt out by either changing your e-mail preferences or using the link provided at the bottom of each email message. 

We do not send emails to anyone without permission, and we do not sell or rent email addresses to any unauthorized third party. This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet. If you believe that you have received an unsolicited email from us, please contact us at the e-mail below and we will investigate. 

**POLICY TOWARDS CHILDREN**

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [privacy@ConvertMedia.com](mailto:privacy@ConvertMedia.com). If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.

**SECURITY**

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, the security of user information may be compromised at any time. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of Personal Information and disclaim any assurance that such information will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access.

**LINKS**

Our Site may have links to the sites of other companies. We are not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.

Where appropriate, you may have your Personal Information erased, rectified, amended or completed.
