“ **You** ” and “ **Your** ” refers to you, the person accessing the Website and which by doing so, accepts this Privacy Policy. Any use of the above terminology or other words in the singular, plural, capitalization are taken as interchangeable and therefore as referring to the same. 

##  **2\. What type of information we collect**




We may collect two types of data and information from our Users. 

The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to you, which may be made available or gathered via your use of the Services (" **Non-personal Information** "). We are not aware of the identity from which the Non-personal Information is collected. Non-personal Information which is collected may include your aggregated usage information and technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information about your device (e.g., the device you use, the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time and the website's domain name from which you linked to the Services, etc.), in order to enhance the functionality of the Services. We may also collect information about your activity on the Services (e.g., clicks, actions, online browsing, etc.). 

The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (" **Personal Information** "). Such information may include: 

  * **Account Information** : When you sign-up and register to the Services, you will be asked to provide us certain details about yourself. You may register to the Services directly through our website.​ 
    * **Registering through our website** : When you register to the Services through our website, we may collect from you the following information: full name, email address, phone number, full home address (country, state/province, zip code, city, street, house number), gender, date of birth, ID information (issuing country, number, expiry date, etc.), images of identification documents, images of proof-of-residence (utility bills, bank/credit card statements, government-issued letters), images of yourself (selfie photos), information required for our compliance with regulatory Know Your Customer requirements (e.g., contents of KYC Questionnaire and Service Applicant Declaration Form [estimated amount of intended activity, purpose of buying virtual currency, source of the funds used to buy virtual currency, employment status, profession and job title or position, field of activity of employing company or own business, name of employing company or own business, URL to the website of employing company or own business, signature sample, ultimate beneficiary of purchased virtual currency], etc.), as well as any other information you agreed to share with us.
  * **Voluntarily Provided Information** : We may collect information which you provide to us voluntarily. For instance, when you share additional information about yourself through your use of the Services. We may also collect the feedback, suggestions, complaints and reports which you send to us. Please note that we may also collect complaints about you from other Users, which may include your Personal Information.
  * **Communication Information** : We may collect information from your communications with us. For example, when you communicate with us, or respond to communications from us, via email, chat, audio or video calls (" **Communications** "). We may record and keep all the Communications.
  * **Device Information** : We may collect Personal Information from your device. Such information may include geolocation data, IP address, unique identifiers, as well as other information which relates to your activity through the Services.



For avoidance of doubt, if we combine Personal Information with Non-personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information as long as it remains combined.
