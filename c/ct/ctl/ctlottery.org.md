# CT Lottery Official Web Site - Privacy Policy

privacy policy  
  
Thank you for visiting the Connecticut Lottery Corporation’s website and viewing our Privacy Policy.  This policy outlines the type of information collected on this website and the limited way in which the Connecticut Lottery Corporation (the “CLC”) uses that information. 

We are strongly committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information that is gathered during the use of our website.  However, because information that we receive is subject to the Connecticut Freedom of Information Act, we cannot ensure absolute privacy.  Information that you provide to us may be available to members of the public under that law.  This policy is intended to provide you with the information you need to make an informed choice about your use of this site and your decision on whether to share personal information with us through this site.  
  
personal information and choice  
  
"Personal information” is information about an individual that is readily identifiable to that specific individual.  Personal information includes such information as an individual’s name, address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, or date of birth.   A domain name or internet protocol address is not considered personal information.

**For us to have access to your personal information, you have to voluntarily provide it.**   In other words, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation never collects the personal information you voluntarily provide without your choice, consent or knowledge.     
  
Information Collection & Usage  
  
  
There are two types of information that we collect, store and use: (1) automatically-collected non-personal information and (2) voluntarily-provided personal information.   The CLC does NOT collect any personal information from you when you visit our site, unless you expressly and voluntarily participate in an activity on our website that asks for it and you voluntarily provide such personal information.    
  
  
Automatically-Collected Non-Personal Information  
  
  
When you visit our website, basic information is passively collected through your web browser.  This information is **non-personal** information and does not individually identify you, such as:   


  * The domain name and IP address from which you accessed our website. 
  * The type of browser and operating system used to access our website.
  * The date and time and length of your visit to our website. ****
  * The specific page visited, graphics viewed and any documents downloaded from our website.
  * The specific links to other sites you accessed from our website.
  * The specific links from other sites you used to access our website.   




**How This Information is Used**

The CLC will use automatically-collected non-personal information to compile generic reports about popular pages and to see how our group of players are accessing our site.  This information may be used to improve the usability of our site so that our players have a better experience when visiting it.  
  
Voluntarily-Provided Personal Information  
  
When you participate in an activity on our website that asks for your personal information, and you voluntarily choose to provide such information you are voluntarily consenting to identify yourself.   For example, if you choose to send us an e-mail, or register for a second chance drawing promotion, or fill out an on-line form, or participate in a player survey, you are voluntarily providing personal information to the CLC and by providing such information to the CLC you acknowledge and agree that you are voluntarily giving us your consent to collect, use and disclose such information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  If you prefer that we not collect such information, please do not provide it or participate in those activities of our website that request it.   Participation is strictly your choice.  While it may limit your ability to take full advantage of the website, it will not impair your ability to access important Lottery player information. 

**How This Information is Used**  
The CLC may use voluntarily-provided personal information to communicate directly with you on a one-to-one basis. 

_**Sending E-mail**_   
Your e-mail address and other personal information you provide contained in or attached to your e-mail are retained and used in order for us to respond back directly to you.  If you prefer we not collect, use or store this information, please do not e-mail us.  Instead, you may want to communicate with us by phone or in person.

_**Registering in Second Chance Drawing Promotions**_

Personal information you provide by participating in Second Chance Drawing Promotions is collected and maintained by the CLC.  The CLC uses that information to verify that the potential entrant is age-eligible to participate. (See note about age requirement below.)  Information you provide about your residence and game preferences may be used to customize our promotional pages with news and events most relevant to you.  As described above, e-mail addresses may also be used to communicate directly with you about the drawing or other lottery related information.  You may modify or delete any voluntarily-provided personal information you have provided by using the Change Profile feature of this website. Any change or deletion of such information will remove the original information from our active database but will not delete the original information from our archived records.
