The following is the type of information collected about your visit to the Web site: the name of the Internet domain from which you access the CTA site (for example, "yahoo.com" if you are connecting from Yahoo) and the date and time you access our site and what files you viewed. If you choose to provide us with personal information in an e-mail message, we use it only to respond to your e-mail.
