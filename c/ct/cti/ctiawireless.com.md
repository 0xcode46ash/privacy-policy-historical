### WOW-COM速 Web Site Privacy Policy

CTIA is committed to protecting the privacy of WOW-COM速 users personal information. This privacy statement applies with respect to the information that CTIA collects from its WOW-COM速 Web site, located at [_www.wow-com.com_](http://www.wow-com.com/). Amendments to this privacy statement will be posted at this URL and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of this site following the posting of any amendment, modification or change shall constitute your acceptance thereof.

**INFORMATION COLLECTED**  
We collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address, computer settings or most-recently visited URL. We may also ask you to provide certain non-personally identifiable information about yourself, such as your age, household income, your profession, buying preferences, etc. We do not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to the WOW-COM Web site by, for example, filling out a survey or registration form. The types of information that may be requested include your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.

**USE OF INFORMATION**  
CTIA may use the information to tell you about WOW-COM products or services that we feel may be of interest to you. Personally identifiable information may be used to contact you again either by online electronic communication (such as e-mail), or by regular mail or telephone. WOW-COM users may opt-out of receiving future mailings from CTIA by unsubscribing from the CTIA Daily News or e-mailing [_webmaster@ctia.org_](mailto:webmaster@ctia.org).

Non-personal demographic and profile data is used to tailor your experience at the WOW-COM Web site, showing you content we think you might be interested in. This information may also be shared with advertisers on an aggregate, non-personal basis. When CTIA shares such information with advertisers, it is not traceable to any particular user and will not be used to contact you again.

CTIA hosts several industry-leading events each year, including the world's largest Wireless show and the groundbreaking Agenda conferences. CTIA offers on-line registration for these events at the WOW-COM Web site. We may use the information that you provide on the on-line registration form to tell you about future CTIA events that we feel may be of interest to you, and we may also share this information with other entities from whom we believe you may want to receive information concerning wireless-related products or services. Personally identifiable information may be used to contact you again either by online electronic communication (such as e-mail), or by regular mail or telephone. WOW-COM users that register on-line for CTIA events may opt-out of receiving future mailings from CTIA or other entities by selecting the appropriate box on the on-line registration form.

**USE OF IP ADDRESSES**  
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the WOW-COM Website.

**USE OF COOKIES**  
When you view the WOW-COM Web site we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on the WOW-COM Web site. Cookies do not spy on you or otherwise invade your privacy, and they cannot invade your hard drive and steal information. Rather, they help you navigate a Web site as easily as possible. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. Cookies can allow the WOW-COM Website to remember you when you return so you do not have to enter your registration data at each connection.

**SECURITY**  
The WOW-COM Web site uses industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, CTIA will take reasonable steps to protect the safety of your personal information.

**OTHER WEBSITES AND LINKS**  
The WOW-COM Web site contains links to other websites. CTIA is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

**CORRECTION & UPDATE OF INFORMATION**  
CTIA allows its users the option to change or modify information previously provided. This may be done through the following methods:

  1. E-mail the information to [_webmaster@ctia.org_](mailto:webmaster@ctia.org); or
  2. Visit the Registration Section of the WOW-COM Web site and follow the appropriate instructions.



CTIA will use reasonable efforts to ensure that your information is removed from or corrected in our records.

**CONTACTING US**  
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with the WOW-COM Web site, you can contact us at [_webmaster@ctia.org_](mailto:webmaster@ctia.org).
