# Privacy Policy

CTIA-The Wireless Association (“CTIA” “we” “use” and “our”) has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and security. This Privacy Policy applies to all visitors of our website and customers of our services. To better protect your privacy, this Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used by CTIA. We encourage you to read the entire policy so you fully understand how we collect, use, and store your personal information.

 **Information We Collect**  
Our website is primarily an informational site, which means that you can visit it without telling us anything about yourself. However, depending on how you choose to use and interact with our website, we may collect the following types of information from you: 

  * Account information includes your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and other contact information, as well as service-related details such as billing information and transaction history.
  * Web browsing information includes your IP addresses, URLs, browser history, and information about your device such as operating system and platform type.



 **How We Collect Information**  
We collect information about you in two ways: 1) information you provide to us, and 2) information we collect automatically. 

**Information you provide.** When you make a purchase, set up an account with us, or communicate with us by any means, you voluntarily provide information to us. For example, when you go to our website and sign up to receive our CTIA Mobile Minute mailer, you provide us with your name and email address. Similarly, if you make a purchase through our online store, you provide us with your contact and billing information such as your name, address, and payment card number. Whenever you provide information to us, we may use that information to communicate with you about your use of our services (including any relevant service updates and promotions) and our website.

Co-sponsorships. If you provide your information to us in order to register for an event or a promotion that we sponsor with another organization, or if you visit a co-sponsored site, or use a service that we promote through a partnership with another organization, you also may be providing information to our co-sponsor. In that instance, you should refer to that co-sponsor or partner’s privacy policy for information about its practices, which may differ from those of CTIA.

 **Information we collect automatically.** To deliver a more personalized experience, when you visit our website or use our services, we automatically collect certain pieces of information. The information that we collect includes the device you use to access our website, the pages you visit, the time you spend on our website, the links that you click on and follow, the search terms you enter, how often you access an application or portion of the website, and how long you spend on our website. 

**Cookies & Other Technologies **  
We use cookies, web server logs, and other technologies to collect information about you when you interact with our website. A cookie is a small data string that is written on your computer’s hard drive by a web server that enables our website to maintain information when a user's web browser requests a series of web pages. Cookies generally hold data strings that contain a unique user ID that allow us to customize your experiences on our website and gather information about your navigation of the website. Cookies allow us to help verify the identity of a website user, to recognize you as a registered user, and to remember your settings and preferences so that you do not have to enter the same information each time you visit our website. We also use cookies to deliver content tailored to your interests, keep track of your online ordering, and alert you to new services based on your current services. You may refuse our cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on in your browser to access our website, but without cookies, certain features of our website will not be available to you.

 **Information We Share**  
We use vendors and service providers for a variety of business purposes to help us offer, provide, and bill for services we provide. We share your information with third party vendors and service providers when it is necessary for them to perform work on our behalf. For example, we may provide your payment card information and billing address to our payment processing vendor solely for the purpose of processing payment for a transaction that you have requested. We do not sell, rent, license, or lease your information to third parties. Information Security and Data Retention We have technical, physical, and administrative safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use, and disclosure of the information that we collect or store, including your contact and payment information. Our employees are trained on the importance of protecting privacy. Under our practices and policies, access to sensitive information that could be used to identify you as an individual is authorized only for those who have a business need for such access, and sensitive information is retained only as long as necessary for business, accounting, tax, or legal purposes. 

Although we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, no program is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that the safeguards we have in place will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your personal information. If you become aware of a security issue, please contact us at [security@ctia.org](mailto:security@ctia.org). We will work with you to address any problems.

 **Third Party Links and Websites**  
Please note that we are not responsible for the websites, apps, or services of third parties. Our website may contain links to third party websites, apps, or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of information that you provide to those third party websites, apps, and services are not governed by this Privacy Policy. 

**Your Choices & Controls **  
You have control over the information that you receive from us. If at any time you want to opt out of any mailing list such as the CTIA Mobile Minute newsletter service, you may also opt out directly through the Unsubscribe link found in the footer of the email. If you wish to change, update, or delete information that you have provided to us for any reason, please contact us at [unsubscribe@ctia.org](mailto:unsubscribe@ctia.org) to make those changes. 

**Children's Privacy**  
Protecting the privacy of the young (i.e., individuals under the age of 13) is especially important. For that reason, we never knowingly collect personally identifying information from anyone under the age of 13 and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. If a child has provided us with personal information, we ask that a parent or guardian of the child contact us at [privacyconcerns@ctia.org](mailto:privacyconcerns@ctia.org) if they would like the information submitted by a child deleted from our database.
