Cleveland Clinic Web Site Privacy Statement  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cleveland Clinic is very interested in the privacy and safety of our visitors. Our Web site contains forms through which users may request information or supply feedback to us.  In some cases, telephone numbers or return addresses are required so that we can supply requested information to you, and in other cases, correct names and addresses are required to process credit card payments.  We may also track where you go or what you read in our Web site so that we can supply you with effective follow up information, but only if you have given us explicit permission to do so by filling out a form that asks you if we may do so.  After you fill out a form, we might contact you ourselves with follow-up information (unless you have checked an "opt-out" box on the form), but we do not provide any information supplied on Web form to any outside organization for any reason (other than where we may be required to by law, or as necessary to process credit card information).

We also do typical web traffic analyses through which we track statistics such as which pages are visited in what order, where users come from, and how long users spend on our site. But we never associate such information with specific identities.

Please note that our forms are encrypted to protect your privacy. Once the information is sent to our site, it is kept in secure databases where it is not available to users on the Internet.

While we sometimes ask for credit card numbers, and either pass them on to a credit card processing service or process them manually, we do not store credit card numbers online.

Please also understand that while we are very interested in providing relevant personal healthcare information to patients and/or their physicians, we will not make such information available online until we are very confident that the information is secure.

If you have any questions about our privacy policy or our use of information gathered through our Web site, please contact our Webmaster at [webmaster@ccf.org](mailto:webmaster@ccf.org)
