# Privacy Policy

Because we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it, we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is used. We will use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy. 

### Introduction

There are several CCEL services that require the collection of personal or non-personal information from you. These services include making purchases through the CCEL Store and signing up with a user name and password to enable you to edit digital facsimile edition documents or add contributions to the bibliography. Other services may set cookies on your computer. These include installing books on your computer and managing your personal preferences. 

### CCEL Store

The CCEL store works in collaboration with [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/). PayPal is governed by its own privacy policy statement, and the CCEL is not responsible for PayPal's operations, including but not limited to its information practices. Users concerned about submitting information to or through PayPal should review PayPal's [privacy statement.](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_privacy)

We receive from paypal.com only your name, postal address, e-mail address, and the item(s) and quantity you have ordered. This information is used only internally, and it is not sold or rented to other parties. _You will not be placed on any mailing lists unless you give permission to do so._

### Our Use of "Cookies"

Cookies are small bits of data that we send to your computer. They identify you as a CCEL user and contain information regarding your locally installed CCEL location and your CCEL preferences such as your preferred Bible version and note location. There are also a couple of cookies that are used to remember the last few pages you've visited. These cookies are implemented to overcome inadequecies in many browsers that prevent you from returning to a previous page when parameters are being passed in. Short-term cookies are used for passing parameters into web pages. 

The cookies are not used for tracking users outside the CCEL website, and they are not accessible by third parties. 

### Website traffic information

When you visit this or any website, information is available to the site on the pages you view, the time of your visit, the browser you are using, the address of the computer you visit from, and the address of the page you are coming from. We use this information internally only, to better understand user needs and preferences and make the CCEL more useful. We do not share this information with third parties unless required by law, and we do not track web sites you visit before or after you access the CCEL.

### Our Use and Disclosure of Information

The CCEL will not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to third parties. 

The CCEL does not send unsolicited e-mail to users. Only users who have voluntarily joined an e-mail list such as the ccel-list or have given permission to receive CCEL announcements receive e-mail from the CCEL. 

### Notification of Changes

This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to CCEL or as we incorporate suggestions from our users. The CCEL is not responsible for notifying users of changes to this policy.

We will post the amended Privacy Policy promptly on our Web site so that you can always review what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Please check the CCEL Web site at [www.ccel.org/info/privacy.html](http://www.ccel.org/info/privacy.html) for the current version of our Privacy Policy.
