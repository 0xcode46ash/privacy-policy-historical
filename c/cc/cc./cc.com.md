This privacy statement describes how Clear Channel Entertainment ("CCEntertainment," "we," "our" or "us") uses and handles information collected from you by our websites: 

  * What kinds of information we collect from users and how the information is collected;   

  * How we use the information we collect;   

  * How we use cookies, web beacons, and similar site-enhancing technologies;   

  * The circumstances under which we disclose user information to third parties;   

  * How you can access, update, or delete information collected about you, and;   

  * Our security procedures 

By using CC.com, you signify your assent to this privacy policy. We may change the policy from time to time, and we encourage you to check this page periodically to see changes we may have made. If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please email us at [privacy@cc.com](mailto:privacy@cc.com). We do not knowingly collect personal information, including contact information, from children under age 13. **The Information We Collect and How We Collect It**

Like many websites, CC.com's web servers automatically collect the Internet Protocol addresses, but not the email addresses, of visitors. We may use this information to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site and pages viewed as well as to diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the site. We may then use this information to analyze and improve the features and functionality of CC.com. This information is generally non-personally identifiable. 

Sometimes, we may ask you for personal information, including your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, entertainment preferences and demographic information. We would likely collect this personal information when you purchase tickets or merchandise through CC.com or websites operated by related Clear Channel Worldwide companies or by CCEntertainment's suppliers such as Ticketmaster, or to register for certain services offered by us, enter sweepstakes or promotions we conduct, send email to CC.com, respond to emails from CC.com, post messages or upload content using CC.com. CCEntertainment also may combine this information from you with other personally identifiable information about you that we receive from other sources. 

We provide you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from CC.com. If you choose to opt-out of receiving such communications, send an email to [clearchannel@custhelp.com](mailto:clearchannel@custhelp.com) or visit the following URL, [http://clearchannel.custhelp.com](http://clearchannel.custhelp.com/). 

**How We Use the Information We Collect**

We collect and store information about you and statistics about your use of our site both in an aggregated, non-personally identifiable way and in a manner that may allow us to identify you personally. For example, we may use information about you and other site visitors on an aggregated basis to sell and deliver advertising, promotions and content that we believe will be of interest to you. We may use personally identifiable information in similar ways. For example, we may use your email address to send you special announcements or notifications of events or services that may be of interest to you and to verify and authorize the use of your credit card. We may use your mailing address to fulfill orders of merchandise and tickets as well as to send you announcements and notifications that may be of interest to you. 

**Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies**

Our site may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These technologies consist of small amounts of computer code sent to your browser by websites, and that are stored on your hard drive. We may use them to improve the functionality of our site, to help us tailor the site to your interests, and to understand better how users use CC.com. They enable us to recognize you when you return and can keep track of information specific to you. We use them to improve the functionality of our site, and we will not use these technologies to transfer information about you to others except as otherwise provided in this privacy statement. 

Sometimes, you may receive such cookies or other files from advertisers or other sites that you link to from CC.com. This is common practice on the Internet. We do not control these files and they are not subject to this privacy policy. You may set your browser to require your permission before you receive a cookie. 

**Disclosing User Information to Third Parties**

From time to time, we may share your email address with venues where events occur, with promoters of events, with other Clear Channel Worldwide companies and with third parties. Whenever possible, CCEntertainment will provide you the opportunity to opt out of sharing your information with third parties except when it is necessary for the purpose it was collected or to fulfill a transaction. The venue, promoter, Clear Channel Worldwide company or third party may send you announcements and notifications of events, products or services that might be of interest to you. These announcements may include gift certificates, sweepstakes, contests, promotions, giveaways and merchandise offerings. Your mailing address will be shared with your credit card company in order to verify that you are an authorized user. It will also be shared with the venue, promoter of the ticketed event or ticket agent, such as Ticketmaster, in order for them to mail tickets or event information to you. 

When you make purchases on the Site or use certain features on the Site, we request you to provide financial information such as account or credit card numbers. We will use your financial information to bill you for products and services or otherwise process your transactions. By making a purchase on the Site, you consent to our providing your financial information to our service providers and to such third parties as we determine is necessary to process your transactions. These third parties may include the credit card companies and banking institutions used to process the transaction. By purchasing products or services of third parties (such as magazine subscriptions) offered on the Site or when you purchase tickets on the Site from our ticketing partners, you also consent to our providing your financial information to those third parties. Any of these various third parties are authorized to use your financial information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control. 

From time to time, we may enter into a relationship with another company that is not owned by CCEntertainment or affiliated with us. These relationships may include "powered by" partners, business or ticketing affiliates, sponsors and co-branded sites. Personal information that you have provided us may be shared with these third parties. Also, when you purchase event tickets directly from us on a CCEntertainment website, on a co-branded page, or from a ticketing agent such as Ticketmaster, your information will be shared with the venues, promoters, artists and other third parties associated with the event for which you buy tickets. Because these third parties will use information about you in accordance with their own privacy rules, you should check their websites for their privacy policies. 

In some situations, the law will require us to disclose information about you to the government or other third parties, or third parties may unlawfully intercept Internet transmissions or private communications. If asked or required by law, we may release information about you to law enforcement, other government officials or private entities if we believe it is necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries. 

**Links**

CC.com contains links and references to other websites and organizations, including websites not under the control of CCEntertainment. Please note that different rules may apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by operators of these third-party websites. CCEntertainment encourages you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties. Although CCEntertainment tries to link only to sites with high standards regarding privacy, CCEntertainment is neither responsible for nor makes any warranties or representations regarding the privacy practices of any of the linked sites. 

**Accessing, Updating or Deleting Information Collected About You**

If personal information is collected from you on the site, you will be able to access and update that information and any preferences that you have provided to us when you register or engage in a transaction (such as buying tickets). However, to the extent that such information is also stored in other databases, CCEntertainment cannot always ensure that these corrections or deletions will immediately reach other databases. 

**Public Forums**

CC.com may make available chat rooms, forums, message boards and news groups. Please remember that information you disclose in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when disclosing personal, financial or other information in any of these forums. 

**Information Security**

CCEntertainment uses reasonable precautions to keep your personal information secure and to disclose such information only to third parties it believes to be responsible. We employ reasonable security measures consistent with standard industry practice for information collected through the site. We believe that we have adequate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alternation of the information that we collect on the site. However, CCEntertainment's affiliates and third-party Internet sites and services that are accessible through CC.com, or parties who collect data in connection with sweepstakes, promotions and other activities, have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. We cannot bear responsibility or liability for the actions of any third parties who may receive the information. 

**U.S. residents**

This site is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the United States and is intended for the enjoyment of U.S. residents. We make no representations that the site is governed by or operated in accordance with the law of other nations. By using it, visitors from outside the U.S. acknowledge that the site is subject to U.S. law and the law of Texas and waive any claims that may arise under their own state or national laws. 

**CCEntertainment Sale or Merger**

If this site, CCEntertainment or Clear Channel Worldwide is sold to or merges with another company not owned by Clear Channel Worldwide, or declares bankruptcy, some or all of the information collected about you may be transferred to a third party as a result of the transfer of assets. If so, we will seek to obligate the third party acquiring such information to use information it receives in a way that is consistent with this privacy policy, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to impose this requirement or that the acquiring third party will comply.
