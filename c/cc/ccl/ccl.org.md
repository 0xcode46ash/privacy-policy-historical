# Privacy Commitment - Center for Creative Leadership

The Center for Creative Leadership is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of our constituents. CCL subscribes to the American Psychological Association's code of ethics regarding the use of an individual's personal data for research; this code is particularly concerned with protecting the rights of the person. In addition, our policies are guided by the U.S. Department of Commerce's "safe harbor" principles covering data privacy for residents of the European Union. In fact, we strive to extend these more stringent data privacy protections to all Center clients, wherever they reside.

We do not rent or sell information about you to any outside organizations. Also, we limit the information we collect from you to the minimum necessary to provide outstanding service. All financial information you give us is kept secure.

In some cases we may use aggregated and/or anonymous information for marketing, product development, strategic or research purposes directly associated with CCL.
