# Privacy Policy

Privacy issues are very important to CustomerSat. CustomerSat is committed to maintaining the highest standards of confidentiality and security for all data collected both from individuals on behalf of our clients through our online feedback systems, as well as from visitors to our publicly available web site.

## Privacy Standards

CustomerSat is a member of the [Council of American Survey Research Organizations](http://www.casro.org/) (CASRO). CustomerSat adheres to all CASRO Code of Standards and Ethics for Survey Research for data and personal information collection, storage and dissemination. 

CustomerSat participates in the [Safe Harbor Privacy Framework](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/sh_overview.html), which is an agreement between The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission on a set of data protection principles that enable U.S. companies to satisfy all requirements under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from EU to the United States.

## Personal Data

CustomerSat provides online survey services to its clients. Typically clients provide CustomerSat with data on customers and other stakeholders such as name, company, location and email address. In addition to its own privacy policies and procedures, CustomerSat strictly conforms to the privacy policies of our clients in using their data. CustomerSat, its clients, or both may use commercially available panel/list partners who provide personal information about people who have previously agreed to receive communications for research purposes.

## How CustomerSat uses the data provided by its Clients

CustomerSat clients provide CustomerSat with data on their customers, which CustomerSat uses to invite participants to complete surveys, personalize the invitations, and customize the surveys. CustomerSat may collect additional personal information from survey participants that typically is made available to the client for whom CustomerSat provides the survey service. Participation in any survey is always optional.

## Onward transfer

Personal data is never shared with any third parties unless the client has specifically authorized such sharing. 

## Disclosures required by law

In certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.

## Aggregate non-personal data

As part of the services CustomerSat provides to its clients, data might be available for the purposes of comparing the performance of various companies in the same industry to aggregate industry-wide performance. Data used for such purposes does not include any personal data ( _i.e_., data that contains any information that could be used to identify the person or organization providing the information).

## Email

CustomerSat only sends survey participation emails to people whose email addresses we have received either from our clients or from opt-in panel/list partners.

## Opting Out

CustomerSat offers all survey respondents an “opt-out” link, which prevents participants from receiving further survey invitations from CustomerSat.

## Cookies

CustomerSat uses session cookies during survey taking to ensure that a respondent’s survey answers are correctly captured. These cookies are automatically deleted when the browser is closed. CustomerSat’s pop-up surveys use persistent cookies, preventing web visitors from being surveyed multiple times.

## Visitors to CustomerSat’s web site

CustomerSat may collect non-identifiable information from visitors to its web site to help provide better customer service. For example, CustomerSat might keep information of the domains from which people visit, the IP address from which they came, and which pages those visitors accessed. This allows CustomerSat to analyze trends and statistics, and helps CustomerSat provide superior web site content.

Web visitors may be asked to provide personal contact information in exchange for access to white papers and certain other content on our website. CustomerSat may use this information for sales and marketing purposes. This information will never be shared with any third party.

## Security

CustomerSat is serious about security. CustomerSat uses industry standard security measures to protect the data collected; including the use of encryption, firewalls, virus detection, demilitarized zones and intrusion detection systems. CustomerSat’s servers are hosted in secure locations with 24x7 security and physical access controls. Only a limited number of authorized employees are allowed physical access to the hosting location.

## Contact us

If you have any questions or comments on CustomerSat’s privacy policy you can email: [privacy@customersat.com](mailto:privacy@customersat.com) or you can write to CustomerSat Inc., 500 Ellis Street, Mountain View, CA 94043.
