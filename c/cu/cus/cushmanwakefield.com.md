### Use of cookies, web beacons and other devices

We may use information obtained about you from cookies, files which are sent by us to your computer or other access device, which we may access when you open an email from us or visit our site in future.

We are able to do this by including web beacons (also known as clear GIFs or web bugs) in our emails. We use cookies and web beacons so that we can identify our users and personalise the site and our services whenever possible and to track the success of our marketing campaigns. The devices store small pieces of information about visitors which means that on future visits to our site, we can identify past visitors and welcome them back and that if you open an email from us we can see which pages of our site you visit.

If you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer, please refer to the instructions for your file management software to locate the file or directory that stores cookies. Our cookies will have the file names [X.@cushwake.com.txt,Y.cushwake.com..txt] .

Further information on deleting or controlling cookies is available at www.AboutCookies.org Please note that by deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our site.

Our web beacons do not store additional information on your computer but, by communicating with our cookies on your computer, they can tell us when you have opened our email. If you object to web beacons, we recommend that you follow the instructions for deleting existing cookies and disabling future cookies. We will still know how many of our emails are opened and we will automatically receive your IP address, a unique identifier of your computer or other access device; but we will not identify you as an individual. With or without web beacons, your IP address may also be logged when you visit our site.

### How do we use your information for marketing?

We may share your information within our international partnerships, group companies and affiliated organisations and with our business partners for marketing purposes or we may send you information about other organisations' goods and services.
