# Custom Writing Service

CustomWritings.com respects each individual’s right to personal privacy. We will collect and use information through our Web site only in the ways disclosed in this statement.

### Information Collected 

You always remain in control of the information you provide to CustomWritings.com.

We collect two types of information about visitors:

Personal information (when you place an order) - name, address, and e-mail address, which you have voluntarily submitted to us.   
Aggregate information - information about how many visitors log on to our sites, the pages they access, etc. 

We never, under any circumstances, receive credit card information.

### How We Use It

This information is used for providing the user with suitable service, contacting the client by email and delivering the completed work. It is also used in order to provide the user with the greatest ease for navigating through the website.

We NEVER use your personal information to send you advertisements or promotions for products and services and NEVER share our customers’ information with other parties. We do not make any information that you send, fax, or upload available to anyone else. 

### Data Storage

We do not maintain any databases with completed essays. All essays are custom made and are completed for each client individually. You will receive the paper in two versions. The first is a secure PDF version for review. The second version is sent after you have approved a paper and agreed for its content. After you have received the paper it becomes your property. We do not save it or resend to any 3rd party. 

### Security 

We take steps to make all information received from you online as secure as reasonably possible against unauthorized access and use.  

If you have any further questions about privacy or security, please contact us.
