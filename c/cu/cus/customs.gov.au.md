# Privacy on the Customs Internet site

  


**Privacy Policy**

This section was last revised on 3 May, 2001  


The Australian Customs Service homepage is a cookie-free site*

When you visit this site, our Internet Service Provider records your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes:

  * the user's service address;
  * the user's top domain name (for example .com, .gov etc);
  * the date and time of your visit,
  * the pages accessed and documents downloaded;
  * the previous site visited; and
  * the type of browser used.



No attempt is made to identify users except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law-enforcement agency or other government agency exercises a legal authority to inspect the Internet Service Provider's logs (eg by warrant, subpoena or notice to produce).

Customs will retain your e-mail address if you send a message. This will be used only for the intention it was provided and will not be added to a mailing list.

Your e-mail address will not be disclosed without your consent.

**Links to other sites**

The Customs website has links to many other Federal agencies.

Once you link to another site you are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.

**Warning**

Once Customs receives information from you by e-mail or any other means, it is in a secure environment.

You should however, be aware of inherent risk associated with the transfer of information via the Internet.

The information you submit to the Australian Customs Service is not sent via secure methods. Customs does not use security measures such as encryption.

*A cookie is a piece of information that an Internet Web site sends to your browser when you access information at that site.
