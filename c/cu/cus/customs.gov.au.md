# Privacy statement

## Handling personal information - ePassport

In order to perform its functions, Australian Customs may collect your personal information to process you and your goods across Australia's borders.

All personal data we collect via automated ePassport control, (including your photograph), will be treated in the same way as passenger's personal information we collect manually upon arrival.

The personal information collected by automated ePassport control includes a passenger's name, gender, date of birth, passport number, travel details, your passport photograph, the facial biometric template, nationality and the country of origin of the passport.

Customs takes steps to store personal information securely, prevent its unauthorised use and maintain its accuracy.

Customs will only use or disclose the personal information only for the purpose for which it was collected or as otherwise required or authorised by law, including where the information is required by other law enforcement or border control authorities.

Personal information collected by automated ePassport control (including a passenger's photograph) is disclosed either regularly, or from time to time, as authorised under the _Customs Administration Act 1985_ amongst others, to:

  * the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs
  * the Australian Federal Police
  * the Attorney-General's Department
  * the Australian Crime Commission
  * the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service
  * the Department of Environment and Heritage
  * the Australian Cash Transactions Reports and Analysis Centre
  * the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
  * the Director of Public Prosecutions
  * the State and Territory Police forces, and  
overseas customs and immigration authorities.



Records of a passenger's personal information are retained until they are disposed of according to the latest Disposal Authority approved by the National Archives of Australia under the _Archives Act 1983_.

## Laws governing Customs handling of personal information

Customs is required to adhere to the Information Privacy Principles as set out in the _Privacy Act 1988_ in relation to collection, use and disclosure of personal information.

Customs must also comply with s.16 of the _Customs Administration Act 1985_ when disclosing any personal information which has been collected via automated ePassport control. This provision requires an authorised person to ensure that disclosure of personal information is for permissible purposes.
