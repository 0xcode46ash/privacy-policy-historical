This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a website to the hard drive of your computer allowing the website to identify you and track your activities on our site. Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to simplify and enhance the experience on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie information is no longer available through our server. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses in log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track a user's movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Log files do not enable us to access personally identifying information, such as email addresses.
