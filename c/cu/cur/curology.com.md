# Privacy Policy | Cureology With Dr.Steve

Regarding the predominately FREE areas on this site, our policy is simple. Any information which you submit is protected. It is your choice as to how much information you provide in discussion areas such as comments sections. As anywhere else on the internet, this information is not completely impervious to hacking attacks by misguided individuals lurking on the internet.

**We do not, under ANY circumstances, reveal, share or sell your contact information to any third party at any time! Period!**

Regarding any paid services which have the potential to include personal patient identifying characteristics, please make note of the following. First of all regarding email communication, there is an internal private messaging system on this site. It is more secure than external email communications, which are not secure on the internet at all. Please use the utmost care and limit transmitting Protected Personal Health Information (PHI) as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and related regulations.

Regarding any individualized and personalized reports that may be developed for you by special arrangement, based on the information you provide, we prefer as little patient identifying information (PHI) from you as possible. Information is what you really need and our goal is to help you sort through the vast amount of disorganized/out-of-date data (and _mis_ -information) out there and facilitate your decision-making ability in concert with your treating health care provider(s). In no way should anything on this website replace a health care practitioner patient relationship.
