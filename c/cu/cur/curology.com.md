Additionally, when you visit the Website or use your Account, Curology may collect technical and navigational information, such as computer browser type, Internet protocol address, pages visited and average time spent on the Website. This information may be used, for example, to alert you to software compatibility issues, or it may be analyzed to improve web design and functionality.

### Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to Third Parties.

The Website may contain links to third party sites whose information, privacy and security practices may be different than ours. Before using these third party sites or providing them with your PII, you should carefully review and evaluate the privacy notices for such sites, as Curology has no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

In certain cases, you may be directed to a third party site to provide information to complete a transaction in connection with the Website. In such cases, any information you provide to such third party sites directly to such third party will be subject to the applicable third party's privacy policy and terms of service. For example, Stripe, Inc. (" **Stripe** ") provides third party payment processing services for Curology. All payments made to Curology will be processed by Stripe. The privacy policies of Stripe may differ from those of Curology. Any information you submit to Stripe will be governed by their privacy statements. Accordingly, Curology encourages you to carefully read their privacy statements.

CUROLOGY DOES NOT CONTROL AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR, HOW THIRD PARTIES HANDLE YOUR PII. PLEASE EXERCISE CAUTION AND CONSULT THE PRIVACY POLICIES POSTED ON EACH THIRD PARTY WEBSITE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. CUROLOGY AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS, REPRESENTATIVES, AND AGENTS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATING TO THE ACCURACY, QUALITY, AVAILABILITY, RELIABILITY, OR SECURITY OF ANY THIRD PARTY WEBSITES. CUROLOGY AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS, REPRESENTATIVES, AND AGENTS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PII BY ANY SUCH THIRD PARTY IF SUCH PII IS PROVIDED TO SUCH THIRD PARTY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

### Protection of Personally Identifiable Information.

Curology employs reasonable physical, electronic and managerial security measures, and follows generally accepted industry standards to safeguard your PII.

Curology utilizes firewall barriers, high-grade SSL encryption techniques, and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your online sessions and to protect Accounts and systems from unauthorized access. Curology software and member health records are stored on secure servers and backed up daily. All data is encrypted during storage and transmission.

Curology strictly limits access to your PII. Curology's employees and agents are trained in our confidentiality and privacy policies, and only those employees and authorized agents of Curology who need such information to provide you with the Products have access to your PII, and only under strictly controlled conditions. Curology and its employees and agents will use PII only as necessary to provide the Products through the Website.

Please be aware that no method of data transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure. As a result, while Curology takes extensive measures to protect your PII, it cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to Curology or through the Website. CUROLOGY DOES NOT COVENANT, REPRESENT, OR WARRANT THAT THE TRANSMISSION OF YOUR PII ONLINE WILL BE SECURE, AND YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Your cooperation is imperative in safeguarding your PII. Choose your Account password carefully, as anyone with access to your Account password will be able to assume your online identity and view your medical information, change your PII, and communicate with your Curology health care providers. It is your responsibility to prevent disclosure of your password to others, and to change your password if you feel that its security has been compromised. You may change your password from your Account profile page after logging into your Account. Additionally, you will periodically receive correspondence from Curology at the email address you register with your Account. While these emails will never contain your photos or payment information, they will sometimes include information relating to the details of your acne or skin aging treatment (as applicable). Accordingly, it is critical that you safeguard your designated email address and restrict access thereto. The registration of an email address with your Account indicates your consent for Curology to transmit your PII to such address.
