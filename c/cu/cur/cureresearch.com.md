# Privacy Policy

As patients ourselves, we understand that health matters are very personal and need to be kept private. Your privacy is important to CureResearch.Com and we are committed to protecting that privacy. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for CureResearch.Com. 

## Overview

Generally speaking, we do not attempt to gather personal information except as required to administer the site and provide any services that you may have asked for. Specific details of certain privacy issues are discussed in subsequent sections. In general, our privacy practices can be summarized as follows: 

  * We do not sell or distribute personally identifiable information. We only share aggregate statistical information (if any) with our advertisers, affiliates, or partners. 
  * Personal information such as email addresses or shipping addresses obtained from you through purchases from our [Amazon.com Zshop](http://www.amazon.com/shops/wrongdiagnosis) may be used by us for opt-out newsletters or other marketing purposes. 
  * In many cases we do not even have your personally identifiable information and make no attempt to get it. Ordinary viewing of public CureResearch.Com pages does not log anything other than standard web server logs (e.g. IP address, page viewed, date and time), and we make no attempt to identify you from this information. Credit card details for orders at our [Amazon Zshop](http://www.amazon.com/shops/wrongdiagnosis) are handled by Amazon.com and are not seen by us. For ordinary Amazom.com referral book sales that bypass our Amazon Zshop, we do not gather personal information or credit card details. 
  * CureResearch.Com does not track sessions for ordinary viewing of our site, but may do so to allow entry to protected pages such as membership-only pages or credit card purchased documents. 
  * CureResearch.Com does not use cookies, but our advertisers may. 



The following sections discuss these issues in further detail. 

## Log Files

Most internet sites collect basic data in log files on web servers. When you perform an action at our web site, such as viewing a HTML page, the following information is typically collected by standard web server configuration, and may be logged by our web servers: 

  * IP address 
  * Page requested (i.e. which document is viewed) 
  * Referrer page (where did you come from, if arriving from a link to us) 
  * Date and time 
  * Web browser type and version (e.g. Netscape versus Internet Explorer) 
  * Other technical information 



**IP addresses:** Whenever you access the Internet, all computers are assigned IP addresses to allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. These are usually written as 4 numbers separated by dots, such as 12.34.56.78, where each number is in the range 0 to 255 inclusive. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. For example, we may need to determine how many "unique visitors" our site has had, and from which countries the visitors came. We may use IP addresses combined with pages visited to track user movement through a site, but only on an aggregate basis to determine which web pages are most used, and which paths through the site are the most useable. However, CureResearch.Com may use IP addresses in special cases, such as to identify visitors who refuse to comply with our terms of use or who may threaten our service, site, customers and others. 

## Cookies

CureResearch.Com does not use cookies. However, our advertiser partners may use cookies, though we have neither control of nor access to the data from these cookies. CureResearch.Com does not attempt to create or access cookies or to match cookies to any other personally identifiable information. 

**What is a cookie?** A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user, such as which activities they conducted while on our site. Cookies are temporary files created during a web session; once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. It is also possible to configure your web browser to reject cookies should you so wish. 

## Sharing/Disclosure

Except as set forth in this privacy statement, CureResearch.Com will not disclose to unaffiliated companies any information it gathers from you which could be used to identify or contact you ("Personal Information"). Any Personal Information provided to entities affiliated with CureResearch.Com will be treated in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement, unless you are otherwise notified. In the following limited circumstances we will consider, and may release, Personal Information to third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, or court order; or (2) in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others, or to identify malicious users who may threaten our service, site, customers and others. 

We will share aggregated statistical and demographic information with our partners and advertisers. For example, the number of users of our site, or the number of users of particular documents or subareas of the web site. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

## Credit Card Information

This site does not currently accept credit card details directly. Instead, our partners such as Amazon.com process credit card transactions without distributing this information to us. For example, credit card details for orders at our [Amazon Zshop](http://www.amazon.com/shops/wrongdiagnosis) are handled by Amazon Payments and are not seen by us. Email and shipping addresses are provided for us to ship product, but we do not see your billing details. Furthermore, for ordinary Amazom.com book, magazine or other referral sales that bypass our Amazon Zshop, we do not even receive email addresses or personal information, let alone credit card details. If for any reason we do receive your credit card details, we will use such information only in order to perform credit card verification and transaction approval. Our partners that collect credit card information may use this information in accordance with their own privacy or other policies and this is beyond our control. 

## Links

This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. This web site contains links to other web sites on the internet. Please be aware that we at CureResearch.Com are not responsible or liable for the privacy practices of such other web sites. 

We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. You access destination links at your own risk.

## Third Party Advertising Services

CureResearch.Com may utilize certain third-party advertising services (e.g. organizations such as DoubleClick) to display advertising for our advertisers. These third-party services may place a cookie on your computer for the purposes of ad tracking and presentation. CureResearch.Com does not share personally identifiable visitor information with its advertising services. 

## Public Forums

CureResearch.Com may provide its users with chat rooms, forums, discussion areas, message boards and/or news groups. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. Information disclosed in these areas is not subject to this Privacy Statement and will be seen by third parties not related to CureResearch.Com and may be used by them for unauthorized purposes, such as to contact you. 

## Security

This web site has security measures to protect our users’ information that is under our control. CureResearch.Com employs strict security measures to safeguard online transactions. Personal information is stored on a secured server with strict access controls and is protected by several levels of security technology. However, we do not warrant or represent that any information you submit to CureResearch.Com will be protected against loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties. 

## Notification of Changes
